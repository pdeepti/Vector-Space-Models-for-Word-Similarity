program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 19.11.2010 german politicians renew debate over data retention policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas de maiziere supports more data retention as new terror threats loom , party leaders ca n't agree how personal data should be stored .
the conflict stems from a 2006 eu directive that was overturned in germany earlier this year . as germany copes with new terror threats against the country this week , there have been renewed calls by some german politicians to restore germany 's 2007 data retention law , which was declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court earlier this year .
the law required telecommunications companies to store all e-mail , web traffic , landline and mobile data of each user for six months .
the idea is that through what is known as " data traffic analysis , " authorities can re-construct important information about a suspect given a pattern of phone conversations , text messages or e-mails .
even without the contents of the actual correspondence , law enforcement officials have said that knowing when or where a person made a mobile phone call can be crucial in an investigation .
the ruling relied largely on the argument that the law went against article 10 , paragraph 1 of the german basic law , which protects the secrecy of comunications and describes it as ironclad : " the private exchange of communications is protected against unauthorized interference . "
in the months that followed the march 2010 ruling overturning the law in germany , a political disagreement has broken out among various government ministers , most notably , justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who supports the ruling , and interior minister thomas de maiziere , who supports renewed data retention .
their debate has become yet another area of conflict between their respective parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the fdp , the main coalition partners in the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : law enforcement authorities around europe generally support stronger data retention laws government officials and law enforcement in many european countries , including sweden , have called for longer retention periods and said the saved communications data played important roles in solving serious crimes .
" it is a necessary and effective tool that makes it easier to uncover some crimes , " beatrice ask , sweden 's justice minister , told reporters in stockholm earlier this month .
however , there have been reports of abuse , which is precisely what internet and privacy advocates have warned against . in a report issued in july , the european data protection supervisor in brussels said telecom companies were saving and handing over data in ways that contradicted the directive and infringed on individuals ' privacy . " the data retention directive is a totally failed initiative , " joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative told deutsche welle .
" the european commission has had to postpone its report on its implementation repeatedly because it can not find evidence to justify its existence . " in response to questions from national governments and the european parliament , the european commission has agreed to reevaluate the directive .

the visit will most likely happen in september . arrangements for pope benedict xvi 's first official visit to his home country are under way , after the pontiff accepted the invitation of german president christian wulff .
the pope will travel to the archdioceses of berlin , freiburg and erfurt in late 2011 , according to a statement from the german episcopal conference .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the chairman of the conference , said the visit would be " an important moment in the life of our country . "
" i am firmly convinced that he will be a strong inspiration for many people , " zollitsch added .
first official visit the planned visit will be benedict 's first official trip to germany , although he made appearances in cologne while it was hosting world youth day in 2005 and in his native bavaria in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people are expected to pay tribute during a state visit the invitation was extended by christian wulff in october .
" it is a particularly special pleasure and honor for me and many people in our country to welcome the holy father to his home country in the 60th anniversary year of his ordination to the priesthood , " wulff said .
the election of then cardinal joseph ratzinger in april 2005 to succeed the late pope john paul ii was a source of great pride in germany - which is about 30 percent catholic .
the last official papal visit to germany was by pope john paul ii in 1996 . sexual abuse victims still waiting the pontiff is likely to receive a cooler reception from german victims of sexual abuse by priests of the roman catholic church . not much has been done after zollitsch announced in september that the church was preparing compensation payments for abuse victims . the german church has admitted it had failed to properly investigate claims of abuse , simply moving pedophile priests to another diocese instead of reporting them to the police .

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.11.2010 from radical opposition to mainstream party : the rise of the greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are today an influential party in german politics germany 's green party meets for its annual conference this weekend .
it originally set out to be the anti-party party .
now , 30 years later after the party was founded , they 're a force to be reckoned with . west germany was ripe for the founding of the green party in 1980 .
there had been a lack of a serious political opposition during the 1970s and many intellectuals found the political system of then-west germany to lean too far to the right .
at the same time , new social movements were bringing the environment , women 's issues , peace and civil rights into focus after having been largely ignored by the main parties .
the green party was going to reform the system from within .
" we 're switching to the greens .
the only alternative .
we 're voting for the greens . "
with this slightly awkward slogan , the greens began their first election campaign in 1980 .
shortly before , the party had been founded at a national level in karlsruhe .
the party had its roots in the environmental movement , the anti-nuclear movement and civil society .
other issues key to the early greens included questions about arms buildup and the nato double track decision , which allowed for the stationing of american missiles in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele is still fighting for the greens ' causes 30 years later " there were serious problems in our society , " said hans-christian stroebele , a founding member of the greens and , at 74-years-old , the oldest member of parliament for the greens .
“ there was the threat of a nuclear-arms race and the destruction of the planet . ”
the new party was formed as a result of criticism of the party system itself .
the greens wanted to do everything differently from how the established parties did things .
they saw themselves as the anti-party party .
they wanted their own organization to be more democratic , pluralistic and transparent .
to achieve this they introduced a number of strict rules that were only slowly abandoned over the years through struggles from within the party .
for example , originally , elected members of parliament were meant to give up their seats after two years to another party member as part of a rotation system meant to enforce a strict separation between the power of office and the mandate from the people .
both genders and different factions of the party had to be equally represented .
even today the parliamentary group has two co-leaders , one of whom must be a woman .
the colorful oddballs enter parliament in the 1980 elections , however , the greens only won a disappointing 1.5 percent of the vote .
but when an early election was called in 1983 , they managed to get over the 5-percent hurdle to entering the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their long hair and casual clothing , the greens brought an irreverent attitude to politics while the elected members from the other parties met for a church service before the first session of the new parliament , the greens rolled a globe through the center of bonn , then the capital of west germany , and they carried flowers and branches into the bundestag .
with their casual clothing , beards and long hair , the greens brought a little color into the normally dignified gray of the chamber .
but it was n't the way the greens looked that was important , said stroebele .
" what was important were the new topics being addressed from the lectern . "
at first the other parties found it difficult to work with these newcomers to the bundestag .
only over time did they accept the greens and integrate them into the parliamentary process .
in 1990 , however , the greens suffered a setback .
after reunification , they did n't make it over that 5-percent hurdle .
only by joining up with the alliance 90 movement from the eastern german states were they able to secure their spot in the bundestag .
the rise of joschka fischer the early 1990s were a time of reorientation for the party .
internal disputes led several prominent left-leaning green politicians , known as the fundamentalists , to leave the party .
the so-called realists won out in the end with joschka fischer playing a significant role in determining the direction of the party at this time .
fischer had gotten government experience after his time as hessen 's environment minister beginning in 1985 .
in 1994 , he became of one the co-leaders of the greens ’ parliamentary group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an anti-authoritarian in his youth , fischer would lead the greens into government at a party conference in bremen in 1995 , fischer broke a green party taboo , arguing in favor of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , taking part in foreign military missions .
the war in bosnia and the massacre of muslim men and boys in the un-protected zone of srbenica led fischer to move away from the traditionally staunch pacifism of the greens .
after the parliamentary election of 1998 , the greens joined the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in a coalition government and fischer became the country 's foreign minister .
in this new role he had to take some responsibility for germany 's participation in the kosovo war .
this change of course led to bitter arguments with the party base , which was n't ready to endorse the militarization of germany 's foreign policy .
at a special party conference in bielefeld in 1999 things got downright tumultuous , and fischer was hit in the head with a red paint bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer took a lot of flak for his support for germany sending troops to kosovo " this is a war , " the then foreign minister explained to his party at the conference .
" i never dreamed that this coalition of social democrats and greens would be at war .
but this war has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and that 's the point where the greens can no longer be considered a protest party . "
in the end , the party members gave fischer their support and a collapse of the spd-green coalition was avoided .
the biggest victory for the greens during their time in the government was the agreement to phase out nuclear energy use in germany .
after the 2005 elections , the greens went back to being in the opposition .
in 2009 the party received its best election results yet , winning 10.7 percent of the vote .
since then their position in the opinion polls has continued to rise .
in some regions the greens have long beat out the spd in popularity and are seen as the main left-leaning party .
according to stroebele , in some parts of berlin the greens are more popular than any other party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 19.11.2010 germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland needs billions of euros to cover its huge debt a german government spokesman said ireland should be allowed to determine its own corporation tax rate , despite recent pressure from a senior finance expert in chancellor angela merkel 's party . government spokesman steffen seibert friday countered statements made earlier this week by michael meister , one of angela merkel 's senior financial advisers . asked whether germany wanted ireland to raise its corporate tax rate , seibert said this was a matter to be decided by the irish government .
meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

as he leaves , he discusses prejudices and superstitions in islam with a german muslim . the hajj is over and i 'm completely exhausted just like most of the people here , including michael .
he 's a converted muslim from germany .
i met him first in a mosque in cologne before leaving for mecca and now we actually managed to meet again in mecca at the end of the hajj .
to organize our get-together among 2.5 million muslims was quite a feat , despite all the ways to communicate via cell phone and facebook . " i 'm totally overwhelmed by the pilgrimage , " says michael and one can really tell that he 's excited about the experience , but one also notices that the past days have taken a toll on him .
just like me , michael has caught a cold . but that 's not really a surprise : when you visit islam 's holy sites with millions of pilgrims during the day and then spent your nights either in tents or in hotel rooms with the air conditioner turned down low one probably shouldn ’ t expect anything else . spiritual camping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael finkenbrink in cologne before departing to mecca michael 's full name is michael finkenbrink and during our meeting we only hade a couple of minutes for the interview .

" the sanitary facilities here are pretty bad , " michael scolds gently .
but he adds that for three or four days one can deal with it . " it 's absolutely fine with me to sit on a sandy rug for a long time and then spend the night on a simple mat . "
that , he says , is not all that different from going on a camping trip . so what insights did he gain ? any new spiritual or other experiences ?
" i 've met many muslim brothers and sisters who know exactly what they 're doing . "
and michael still raves about the fact that many native-born muslims were very helpful to him during the hajj : " i have never had the privilege of learning about islam through systematic religious instruction .
but what i was able to experience here makes up for much of that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the hajj , an exhausted , but happy michael in mecca still , michael is already advanced enough in his faith to be seriously annoyed when rituals and religious ideas ca n't be derived convincingly from the koran or other islamic sources .
" there are quite a number of devout , but uninformed muslims here , " he says .
what he is referring to is for instance the old superstition that the black stone in mecca is inhabited by a ghost : " that ’ s a focus on outward appearances that have nothing to do with god ! " michael also didn ’ t like the stench and the piles of trash that the crowds of pilgrims have left behind at various places .
" that 's really unacceptable , " he complains , shaking his head .
" cleanliness is of particular importance in islam . " serious messages and devout wishes michael wants to send a message to all the readers of my diary – particularly to readers from non-muslim countries like germany .
he 's speaking them directly into my microphone : " do n't look at the dirt here – look at the dedication of the people here .
dedication – that 's what islam is all about !
to subordinate oneself to god 's will !
and please do n't misunderstand that as a threat ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the window seat : josé , a brazilian muslim of italian descent but michael knows as well as i that this will probably remain a naïve wish as long as radical groups misuse islam for their political purposes thereby automatically placing an entire religion under general suspicion . how often do i need to circle the kaaba ? after our talk , i run to my bus through the pouring rain .
at least this will clean up the streets a little bit .
one of my roommates has been kind enough and already packed my suitcases .

about such seemingly minor details there are often great uncertainties and even disagreements here .
a religious scholar answered me with a definite " no " when i had asked him about it earlier . but josé did n't want to miss out on this ritual - even tough it caused him considerable stress : making the way to the buses and to mosque over and over and over again . i 've also circled the kaaba several times .
just out of journalistic curiosity .
and i remember the words of a pilgrim i met .
he looked pretty exhausted – but he smiled when he told me : " the harder it gets , the more of your sins will be forgiven . "

reports say he has a reputation as an expert in turning around companies , and for personal stubbornness .

jennings was reportedly the personal first choice of bergruen himself , while board chairman alain caparros had favored someone with more direct experience of the german retail industry .

of the job cuts , 1,700 will be in germany .
the leverkusen-based producer aims to invest about half of the program 's savings in new drug and crop chemical research and in expansion in emerging countries , where it plans to create some 2,500 new jobs .
falling revenue , rising competition bayer is the latest big drug company to launch a restructuring program .
the move comes in response to falling revenue caused by generic drug competition , rising development costs and price pressure from health-care reforms imposed by indebted governments .
bundling existing resources and streamlining structures is " the only way , " said bayer chief executive marijn dekkers said in a statement , for the company to be able to continue investing in its expansion , particularly in asia , and to create new innovative products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer ceo marijn dekkers is prescribing some bitter medicine to his employees earlier in the week , swiss drug rivals roche holding and novartis launched their own cost-cutting programs , including sweeping job cuts to secure long-term profitability .
on wednesday , moody 's investors service reiterated a negative outlook on the pharmaceutical sector , citing looming patent expirations and government health-care reforms - all of which will impact drug makers ' profitability .
german government action just last week germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , approved rules to curb the power of pharmaceutical companies to set prices in the country , europe 's largest pharmaceutical market .
the reform , if approved later this month by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , could cost the industry around 2 billion euros a year .
bayer , famous for its aspirin but also a producer of pesticides , plastics and pharmaceuticals , currently employs some 108,700 people worldwide .

under the plans , children aged 15 years and older , who have successfully attended school in germany for at least six years and who speak good german , should be granted the right to stay in the country , even if their parents are not .
" we want to clarify that those who integrate well are welcome , especially when it comes to teenagers , and that we wo n't accept those who do n't integrate , " de maiziere said at the close of the ministers ’ 2-day meeting in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say de maiziere 's proposals are ' inhumane ' mixed reactions while the opposition greens welcomed the proposals as step in the right direction , the left party 's interior affairs expert ulla jelpke called the plans " inhumane " .
she said that they could lead to families being split up , because the parents could still be deported , even if their children become permanent residents .
the catholic charity caritas echoed that sentiment , insisting that " those who are underage should be granted the right to stay by default , not based on how useful they are , " according to the organization 's president , peter neher .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has pledged to speed up the process of getting the proposals signed into law , calling them " a breakthrough " and a " sign of hope " for a modern integration policy .
at present , children of immigrant parents are not treated separately from their parents .
if the parents are not allowed to stay , neither are their children .

under the plans , children aged 15 years and older , who have successfully attended school in germany for at least six years and who speak good german , should be granted the right to stay in the country , even if their parents are not .
" we want to clarify that those who integrate well are welcome , especially when it comes to teenagers , and that we wo n't accept those who do n't integrate , " de maiziere said at the close of the ministers ’ 2-day meeting in hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say de maiziere 's proposals are ' inhumane ' mixed reactions while the opposition greens welcomed the proposals as step in the right direction , the left party 's interior affairs expert ulla jelpke called the plans " inhumane " .
she said that they could lead to families being split up , because the parents could still be deported , even if their children become permanent residents .
the catholic charity caritas echoed that sentiment , insisting that " those who are underage should be granted the right to stay by default , not based on how useful they are , " according to the organization 's president , peter neher .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has pledged to speed up the process of getting the proposals signed into law , calling them " a breakthrough " and a " sign of hope " for a modern integration policy .
at present , children of immigrant parents are not treated separately from their parents .
if the parents are not allowed to stay , neither are their children .

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .

that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "

" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .

the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .

european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .

it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .

of the job cuts , 1,700 will be in germany .
the leverkusen-based producer aims to invest about half of the program 's savings in new drug and crop chemical research and in expansion in emerging countries , where it plans to create some 2,500 new jobs .
falling revenue , rising competition bayer is the latest big drug company to launch a restructuring program .
the move comes in response to falling revenue caused by generic drug competition , rising development costs and price pressure from health-care reforms imposed by indebted governments .
bundling existing resources and streamlining structures is " the only way , " said bayer chief executive marijn dekkers said in a statement , for the company to be able to continue investing in its expansion , particularly in asia , and to create new innovative products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer ceo marijn dekkers is prescribing some bitter medicine to his employees earlier in the week , swiss drug rivals roche holding and novartis launched their own cost-cutting programs , including sweeping job cuts to secure long-term profitability .
on wednesday , moody 's investors service reiterated a negative outlook on the pharmaceutical sector , citing looming patent expirations and government health-care reforms - all of which will impact drug makers ' profitability .
german government action just last week germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , approved rules to curb the power of pharmaceutical companies to set prices in the country , europe 's largest pharmaceutical market .
the reform , if approved later this month by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , could cost the industry around 2 billion euros a year .
bayer , famous for its aspirin but also a producer of pesticides , plastics and pharmaceuticals , currently employs some 108,700 people worldwide .

speaking at a conference in frankfurt , germany , he said that " the best way to continue to deliver the strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of the dollar as well as support the global recovery , is through policies that lead to the resumption of robust growth . "
contentious policies the fed announced the bond-buyback program , a practice known as quantitative easing , on november 3 .
germany and france were quick to condemn the move , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble even called the policy " clueless " and " risky " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke 's monetary policy has drawn criticism at home and abroad " the policies of the us central bank exacerbate the insecurities in the global economy , " schaeuble told the news magazine der spiegel at the beginning of november .
economics minister rainer bruederle accused the fed of protectionist tendencies by " indirectly manipulating " the us dollar 's exchange rates with other major currencies .
the fear in europe is that another bout of quantitative easing in the us , which is designed to flood the markets with cheap money , will devalue the dollar against the euro .
germany , the world 's number two exporter , is especially concerned about the effect of a weak dollar on its exports .
quantitative easing is considered the last resort of monetary policy , when interest rates are zero or close to zero , with the economy stuck in a rut .
the idea is that the central bank buys back sovereign bonds and other government papers to allow banks , insurance companies and pension funds to use the money from the sale for loans to businesses for example .
critics like germany 's schaeuble point out that the excess liquidity caused by quantitative easing bears the risk of stoking inflation and causing another asset bubble .
some say the us is being hyprocritical by accusing china of keeping its currency artificially low against the us dollar , while at the same time weakening the dollar indirectly through its policies .
bernanke , however , said the policies are right in light of sluggish us growth , extremely low inflation and an unemployment rate stuck at a stubbornly high 10 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 19.11.2010 western banks seek to gain stronger foothold in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cell phone usage in afrika attracts international banks and financial service providers africa 's financial market is becoming more interesting to international banks and financial service providers as mobile phone usage increases .
further investment could change the dynamics of the remittance market . the increase in mobile technology and telecommunications in africa is attracting international banks and financial service providers to fuel investments .
according to a british think tank on international development and humanitarian issues , the overseas development institute , africa has offered higher profits for multinational companies compared to the rest of the world for more than a decade .
there is emerging evidence that multinational businesses are seeking a greater stake in africa , especially in financial services .
banks are responding to a growing demand for loans or investment accounts since africans at home and abroad have started looking for more structured ways to do business .
even remittances , money sent home by africans living abroad , are beginning to recover in the aftermath of the global economic crisis .
remittances expert and head of the consultancy developing markets associates , leon isaacs , told deutsche welle that the mobile phone and internet revolution makes market access in africa possible .
any african who has a phone knows how to use it , but most of them do not have a bank account .
mobile phone usage in africa reaches 50 percent " and even if they did they find financial products quite confusing , so if banks in particular can design financial service products that work on a mobile phone , you are going to bring in a whole potential new group of people , " isaacs said .
“ there would be enormous potential , since mobile phone penetration is reaching 50 percent . ”
africans living abroad are also looking for more formal ways to invest back home , rather than sending money through alternative informal routes .
experts say international banks are now looking for ways to encourage people receiving money to start saving and using other financial services , which will not only help the banks with their deposit balance sheets , but help individuals improve their financial welfare .
according to elvina quaison of afford uk , which runs an enterprise project to encourage african disapora investment in ghana , people living locally have often felt cut out of the loop .
" when we asked them have you been to the banks and spoken to them , and they had n't , " she said .
" it was an idea that people had , that the banks did n't want to help them , rather than based in fact . "
banks in ghana are starting to provide support though banks operating in ghana are not keen on start-up loans , they are beginning to provide business support centers to help young companies prove a track record in responsible management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks operating in ghana are starting to help small enterprises " they want you to have an account with them , so they can see how you manage your account , " quaison said .
" it 's good because it 's going to encourage people to plan better , knowing that i need to run my business in such a way for a year before i can access a loan . "
despite the frustrations of raising capital , businesses are finding ways to start up , she said , thanks to the growing recognition from banks of the local market potential .
the head offices of major international banks also see the inflow of hard currency that comes with remittances as a major attraction , but according to isaacs they have been slow to see the value in individual receivers of remittances .
" generally banks in africa have gone for the middle to high income earners and have ignored the fact that a lot of people , or families that are receiving several hundred dollars each month , which would make those customers quite attractive but yet they let them walk out the door with all that money in cash , and do n't see them again until that customer comes back the following month , " isaacs said .
huge business potential for banks reaching out to africans the mobile phone and internet revolution currently underway in africa is beginning to unlock huge business potential , especially for banks reaching out to africans who have not had any access to formal banking yet .
but there is evidence that africa is at the forefront of mobile technology and mobile payments- which could change the landscape of the remittance market forever .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 nato appears on course for new strategic concept nato -pipe- 19.11.2010 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato fears turkey is getting too close to iran turkey is a key player in nato plans to install a missile shield to defend against a nuclear threat from iran .
but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking at a conference in frankfurt , germany , he said that " the best way to continue to deliver the strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of the dollar as well as support the global recovery , is through policies that lead to the resumption of robust growth . "
contentious policies the fed announced the bond-buyback program , a practice known as quantitative easing , on november 3 .
germany and france were quick to condemn the move , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble even called the policy " clueless " and " risky " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke 's monetary policy has drawn criticism at home and abroad " the policies of the us central bank exacerbate the insecurities in the global economy , " schaeuble told the news magazine der spiegel at the beginning of november .
economics minister rainer bruederle accused the fed of protectionist tendencies by " indirectly manipulating " the us dollar 's exchange rates with other major currencies .
the fear in europe is that another bout of quantitative easing in the us , which is designed to flood the markets with cheap money , will devalue the dollar against the euro .
germany , the world 's number two exporter , is especially concerned about the effect of a weak dollar on its exports .
quantitative easing is considered the last resort of monetary policy , when interest rates are zero or close to zero , with the economy stuck in a rut .
the idea is that the central bank buys back sovereign bonds and other government papers to allow banks , insurance companies and pension funds to use the money from the sale for loans to businesses for example .
critics like germany 's schaeuble point out that the excess liquidity caused by quantitative easing bears the risk of stoking inflation and causing another asset bubble .
some say the us is being hyprocritical by accusing china of keeping its currency artificially low against the us dollar , while at the same time weakening the dollar indirectly through its policies .
bernanke , however , said the policies are right in light of sluggish us growth , extremely low inflation and an unemployment rate stuck at a stubbornly high 10 percent .

further investment could change the dynamics of the remittance market . the increase in mobile technology and telecommunications in africa is attracting international banks and financial service providers to fuel investments .
according to a british think tank on international development and humanitarian issues , the overseas development institute , africa has offered higher profits for multinational companies compared to the rest of the world for more than a decade .
there is emerging evidence that multinational businesses are seeking a greater stake in africa , especially in financial services .
banks are responding to a growing demand for loans or investment accounts since africans at home and abroad have started looking for more structured ways to do business .
even remittances , money sent home by africans living abroad , are beginning to recover in the aftermath of the global economic crisis .
remittances expert and head of the consultancy developing markets associates , leon isaacs , told deutsche welle that the mobile phone and internet revolution makes market access in africa possible .
any african who has a phone knows how to use it , but most of them do not have a bank account .
mobile phone usage in africa reaches 50 percent " and even if they did they find financial products quite confusing , so if banks in particular can design financial service products that work on a mobile phone , you are going to bring in a whole potential new group of people , " isaacs said .
“ there would be enormous potential , since mobile phone penetration is reaching 50 percent . ”
africans living abroad are also looking for more formal ways to invest back home , rather than sending money through alternative informal routes .
experts say international banks are now looking for ways to encourage people receiving money to start saving and using other financial services , which will not only help the banks with their deposit balance sheets , but help individuals improve their financial welfare .
according to elvina quaison of afford uk , which runs an enterprise project to encourage african disapora investment in ghana , people living locally have often felt cut out of the loop .
" when we asked them have you been to the banks and spoken to them , and they had n't , " she said .
" it was an idea that people had , that the banks did n't want to help them , rather than based in fact . "
banks in ghana are starting to provide support though banks operating in ghana are not keen on start-up loans , they are beginning to provide business support centers to help young companies prove a track record in responsible management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks operating in ghana are starting to help small enterprises " they want you to have an account with them , so they can see how you manage your account , " quaison said .
" it 's good because it 's going to encourage people to plan better , knowing that i need to run my business in such a way for a year before i can access a loan . "
despite the frustrations of raising capital , businesses are finding ways to start up , she said , thanks to the growing recognition from banks of the local market potential .
the head offices of major international banks also see the inflow of hard currency that comes with remittances as a major attraction , but according to isaacs they have been slow to see the value in individual receivers of remittances .
" generally banks in africa have gone for the middle to high income earners and have ignored the fact that a lot of people , or families that are receiving several hundred dollars each month , which would make those customers quite attractive but yet they let them walk out the door with all that money in cash , and do n't see them again until that customer comes back the following month , " isaacs said .
huge business potential for banks reaching out to africans the mobile phone and internet revolution currently underway in africa is beginning to unlock huge business potential , especially for banks reaching out to africans who have not had any access to formal banking yet .
but there is evidence that africa is at the forefront of mobile technology and mobile payments- which could change the landscape of the remittance market forever .

the visit will most likely happen in september . arrangements for pope benedict xvi 's first official visit to his home country are under way , after the pontiff accepted the invitation of german president christian wulff .
the pope will travel to the archdioceses of berlin , freiburg and erfurt in late 2011 , according to a statement from the german episcopal conference .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the chairman of the conference , said the visit would be " an important moment in the life of our country . "
" i am firmly convinced that he will be a strong inspiration for many people , " zollitsch added .
first official visit the planned visit will be benedict 's first official trip to germany , although he made appearances in cologne while it was hosting world youth day in 2005 and in his native bavaria in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people are expected to pay tribute during a state visit the invitation was extended by christian wulff in october .
" it is a particularly special pleasure and honor for me and many people in our country to welcome the holy father to his home country in the 60th anniversary year of his ordination to the priesthood , " wulff said .
the election of then cardinal joseph ratzinger in april 2005 to succeed the late pope john paul ii was a source of great pride in germany - which is about 30 percent catholic .
the last official papal visit to germany was by pope john paul ii in 1996 . sexual abuse victims still waiting the pontiff is likely to receive a cooler reception from german victims of sexual abuse by priests of the roman catholic church . not much has been done after zollitsch announced in september that the church was preparing compensation payments for abuse victims . the german church has admitted it had failed to properly investigate claims of abuse , simply moving pedophile priests to another diocese instead of reporting them to the police .
the pope himself has faced allegations that he , as cardinal joseph ratzinger , failed to act against molesting priests while he was heading the vatican morals watchdog . author : catherine bolsover , sarah steffen -lrb- afp , ap , epd -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders from the 13 nations with wild tigers are meeting amid claims that the animals could be extinct within a dozen years . leaders from 13 nations began meeting in russia on sunday to discuss the fate of the world 's 3,500 remaining wild tigers . it 's the first time that the heads of government of so many nations will meet to try to save one species . " this is an unprecedented gathering of world leaders -lsb- that aims -rsb- to double the number of tigers , " jim adams , vice president for the east asia and pacific region at the world bank , said at the opening ceremony . " the global tiger initiative is an example of balanced economic development with nature preservation . " hosted by russian prime minister , and self-proclaimed animal lover , vladimir putin , the four-day st. petersburg summit aims to double the number of tigers living in the wild by 2022 . that is the same year the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- has said tigers could become extinct if nothing was done to protect them . compared to the some 100,000 wild tigers estimated to have roamed the world about a century ago , decades of poaching and habitat destruction have left only about 3,500 tigers living in the wild , according wwf statistics . " three subspecies have already disappeared and none of the other six are secure , " according to a draft declaration due to be published at the summit . without drastic conservation measures , exhibits in zoos around the world could become the only places left to see these magnificent big cats .
it has been more than 20 years , for example , since a tiger has been spotted on the indonesian island of java . bildunterschrift : considerable preservation efforts are necessary to keep tigers from extinction russia 's lead russia is the only country to have seen its tiger population increase in recent years , from between 80 and 100 specimens in the 1960s to around 500 today . experts have hailed putin , who was famously photographed tranquilizing an amur tiger to be fitted with a tracking collar , for taking an active role in saving tigers . " russia can play here a leading role as a host and as a good example as its tiger population has actually grown , " sabri zain of traffic , which monitors the global trade in wild animals and plants , told the afp news agency . conservationists are convinced that hope remains . a us study identified 42 sites where aggressive and immediate intervention would save tiger populations , according to joe walston of the wildlife conservation society in new york . " these are the sites where not only are there breeding tigers , but they have potential to repopulate a larger landscape and have conservation infrastructure for us to be confident that these are places we can protect , " he told deutsche welle . methodical poachers despite consensus on the need to save the tiger , there is a stark lack of any coordination on the ground to stop illegal trade in tiger parts like whiskers , paws and bones that are prized in traditional asian medicine . successful conservation is always a multi-pronged effort , ranging from habitat protection to safe-guarding against inbreeding , walston said . but in the case of tigers , it is first and foremost about preventing the animals from being killed by poachers . " these are organized commercial poachers , who are parts of networks , ranging across nations to organize and target killing of tigers and other high commercially valuable species , " he said . " it 's for everything from somebody who wants a tiger head on wall or a rug on floor to people who think they will be a better performer in bed , to people who think it will cure them of certain diseases . " bildunterschrift : the russian summit represents a new level of international commitment to tigers political importance india and china - both among the 13 nations at the meeting that include bangladesh , bhutan , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , nepal , russia , thailand and vietnam - are regarded as the key players in saving the tiger . india is home to half of the world population , while the chinese remain the world 's biggest consumers of tiger products , despite global bans . walston said the four-day summit in russia represents an international commitment to tigers that could go a long way in their preservation . " this has the potential to be the most important meeting for a non-human species ever , " he said .
" it is a remarkable chance not only to put tigers on political map but for us to be able to identify where and how to put our combined efforts . " author .

the dw experts will go to any lengths to get you the match day predictions .
however , all this dabbling in the occult can be tiring so they 've taken a more peaceful approach for week 13 . this predicting lark may seem like a piece of cake to the untrained eye .
for the layman , it must seem that sitting around , plucking random scores form the ether while keeping one eye on the television is a moderately relaxing past-time .
considering how wrong we sometimes get it , it can also appear to be an exercise undertaken with a laissez-faire attitude from the comfort of a well-padded sofa .
in reality , it 's quite a stressful affair .
delving into various dark arts every week , communicating with malevolent soccer spirits in a variety of cod-supernatural rituals can have quite a taxing effect on a pundit - which is why we 've taken off to a cave with our yogi to try and forecast the results for match day thirteen from a state of spiritual nirvana .
altogether now : ommmmm ...
saturday , nov .
20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

the dw experts will go to any lengths to get you the match day predictions .
however , all this dabbling in the occult can be tiring so they 've taken a more peaceful approach for week 13 . this predicting lark may seem like a piece of cake to the untrained eye .
for the layman , it must seem that sitting around , plucking random scores form the ether while keeping one eye on the television is a moderately relaxing past-time .
considering how wrong we sometimes get it , it can also appear to be an exercise undertaken with a laissez-faire attitude from the comfort of a well-padded sofa .
in reality , it 's quite a stressful affair .
delving into various dark arts every week , communicating with malevolent soccer spirits in a variety of cod-supernatural rituals can have quite a taxing effect on a pundit - which is why we 've taken off to a cave with our yogi to try and forecast the results for match day thirteen from a state of spiritual nirvana .

20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

leaders from the 13 nations with wild tigers are meeting amid claims that the animals could be extinct within a dozen years . leaders from 13 nations began meeting in russia on sunday to discuss the fate of the world 's 3,500 remaining wild tigers . it 's the first time that the heads of government of so many nations will meet to try to save one species . " this is an unprecedented gathering of world leaders -lsb- that aims -rsb- to double the number of tigers , " jim adams , vice president for the east asia and pacific region at the world bank , said at the opening ceremony . " the global tiger initiative is an example of balanced economic development with nature preservation . " hosted by russian prime minister , and self-proclaimed animal lover , vladimir putin , the four-day st. petersburg summit aims to double the number of tigers living in the wild by 2022 . that is the same year the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- has said tigers could become extinct if nothing was done to protect them . compared to the some 100,000 wild tigers estimated to have roamed the world about a century ago , decades of poaching and habitat destruction have left only about 3,500 tigers living in the wild , according wwf statistics . " three subspecies have already disappeared and none of the other six are secure , " according to a draft declaration due to be published at the summit . without drastic conservation measures , exhibits in zoos around the world could become the only places left to see these magnificent big cats .
it has been more than 20 years , for example , since a tiger has been spotted on the indonesian island of java . bildunterschrift : considerable preservation efforts are necessary to keep tigers from extinction russia 's lead russia is the only country to have seen its tiger population increase in recent years , from between 80 and 100 specimens in the 1960s to around 500 today . experts have hailed putin , who was famously photographed tranquilizing an amur tiger to be fitted with a tracking collar , for taking an active role in saving tigers . " russia can play here a leading role as a host and as a good example as its tiger population has actually grown , " sabri zain of traffic , which monitors the global trade in wild animals and plants , told the afp news agency . conservationists are convinced that hope remains . a us study identified 42 sites where aggressive and immediate intervention would save tiger populations , according to joe walston of the wildlife conservation society in new york . " these are the sites where not only are there breeding tigers , but they have potential to repopulate a larger landscape and have conservation infrastructure for us to be confident that these are places we can protect , " he told deutsche welle . methodical poachers despite consensus on the need to save the tiger , there is a stark lack of any coordination on the ground to stop illegal trade in tiger parts like whiskers , paws and bones that are prized in traditional asian medicine . successful conservation is always a multi-pronged effort , ranging from habitat protection to safe-guarding against inbreeding , walston said . but in the case of tigers , it is first and foremost about preventing the animals from being killed by poachers . " these are organized commercial poachers , who are parts of networks , ranging across nations to organize and target killing of tigers and other high commercially valuable species , " he said . " it 's for everything from somebody who wants a tiger head on wall or a rug on floor to people who think they will be a better performer in bed , to people who think it will cure them of certain diseases . " bildunterschrift : the russian summit represents a new level of international commitment to tigers political importance india and china - both among the 13 nations at the meeting that include bangladesh , bhutan , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , nepal , russia , thailand and vietnam - are regarded as the key players in saving the tiger . india is home to half of the world population , while the chinese remain the world 's biggest consumers of tiger products , despite global bans . walston said the four-day summit in russia represents an international commitment to tigers that could go a long way in their preservation . " this has the potential to be the most important meeting for a non-human species ever , " he said .
" it is a remarkable chance not only to put tigers on political map but for us to be able to identify where and how to put our combined efforts . " author .

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.11.2010 from radical opposition to mainstream party : the rise of the greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are today an influential party in german politics germany 's green party meets for its annual conference this weekend .
it originally set out to be the anti-party party .
now , 30 years later after the party was founded , they 're a force to be reckoned with . west germany was ripe for the founding of the green party in 1980 .
there had been a lack of a serious political opposition during the 1970s and many intellectuals found the political system of then-west germany to lean too far to the right .
at the same time , new social movements were bringing the environment , women 's issues , peace and civil rights into focus after having been largely ignored by the main parties .
the green party was going to reform the system from within .
" we 're switching to the greens .
the only alternative .
we 're voting for the greens . "
with this slightly awkward slogan , the greens began their first election campaign in 1980 .
shortly before , the party had been founded at a national level in karlsruhe .
the party had its roots in the environmental movement , the anti-nuclear movement and civil society .
other issues key to the early greens included questions about arms buildup and the nato double track decision , which allowed for the stationing of american missiles in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele is still fighting for the greens ' causes 30 years later " there were serious problems in our society , " said hans-christian stroebele , a founding member of the greens and , at 74-years-old , the oldest member of parliament for the greens .
“ there was the threat of a nuclear-arms race and the destruction of the planet . ”
the new party was formed as a result of criticism of the party system itself .
the greens wanted to do everything differently from how the established parties did things .
they saw themselves as the anti-party party .
they wanted their own organization to be more democratic , pluralistic and transparent .
to achieve this they introduced a number of strict rules that were only slowly abandoned over the years through struggles from within the party .
for example , originally , elected members of parliament were meant to give up their seats after two years to another party member as part of a rotation system meant to enforce a strict separation between the power of office and the mandate from the people .
both genders and different factions of the party had to be equally represented .
even today the parliamentary group has two co-leaders , one of whom must be a woman .
the colorful oddballs enter parliament in the 1980 elections , however , the greens only won a disappointing 1.5 percent of the vote .
but when an early election was called in 1983 , they managed to get over the 5-percent hurdle to entering the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their long hair and casual clothing , the greens brought an irreverent attitude to politics while the elected members from the other parties met for a church service before the first session of the new parliament , the greens rolled a globe through the center of bonn , then the capital of west germany , and they carried flowers and branches into the bundestag .
with their casual clothing , beards and long hair , the greens brought a little color into the normally dignified gray of the chamber .
but it was n't the way the greens looked that was important , said stroebele .
" what was important were the new topics being addressed from the lectern . "
at first the other parties found it difficult to work with these newcomers to the bundestag .
only over time did they accept the greens and integrate them into the parliamentary process .
in 1990 , however , the greens suffered a setback .
after reunification , they did n't make it over that 5-percent hurdle .
only by joining up with the alliance 90 movement from the eastern german states were they able to secure their spot in the bundestag .
the rise of joschka fischer the early 1990s were a time of reorientation for the party .
internal disputes led several prominent left-leaning green politicians , known as the fundamentalists , to leave the party .
the so-called realists won out in the end with joschka fischer playing a significant role in determining the direction of the party at this time .
fischer had gotten government experience after his time as hessen 's environment minister beginning in 1985 .
in 1994 , he became of one the co-leaders of the greens ’ parliamentary group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an anti-authoritarian in his youth , fischer would lead the greens into government at a party conference in bremen in 1995 , fischer broke a green party taboo , arguing in favor of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , taking part in foreign military missions .
the war in bosnia and the massacre of muslim men and boys in the un-protected zone of srbenica led fischer to move away from the traditionally staunch pacifism of the greens .
after the parliamentary election of 1998 , the greens joined the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in a coalition government and fischer became the country 's foreign minister .
in this new role he had to take some responsibility for germany 's participation in the kosovo war .
this change of course led to bitter arguments with the party base , which was n't ready to endorse the militarization of germany 's foreign policy .
at a special party conference in bielefeld in 1999 things got downright tumultuous , and fischer was hit in the head with a red paint bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer took a lot of flak for his support for germany sending troops to kosovo " this is a war , " the then foreign minister explained to his party at the conference .
" i never dreamed that this coalition of social democrats and greens would be at war .
but this war has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and that 's the point where the greens can no longer be considered a protest party . "
in the end , the party members gave fischer their support and a collapse of the spd-green coalition was avoided .
the biggest victory for the greens during their time in the government was the agreement to phase out nuclear energy use in germany .
after the 2005 elections , the greens went back to being in the opposition .
in 2009 the party received its best election results yet , winning 10.7 percent of the vote .
since then their position in the opinion polls has continued to rise .
in some regions the greens have long beat out the spd in popularity and are seen as the main left-leaning party .
according to stroebele , in some parts of berlin the greens are more popular than any other party .

however , her supporters are aware that their struggle is far from over . it is celebration time for the burmese community in new delhi that has organized a sports carnival to mark the recent release of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi after years of house arrest . the burmese refugees - many of whom made india their home after having to flee myanmar - have organized volleyball and football competitions to mark the long-awaited occasion .
they have invited the united nations high commissioner for refugees to be their chief guest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delhi has become a home for hundreds of burmese refugees mixed sentiments van hmun lian , one of the sports festival organizers , has mixed sentiments : " we are very happy and we are celebrating aung san suu kyi ’ s release but i don ’ t think we will be able to go back to our country very soon .
her release is diverting people ’ s attention from the rigged and fraudulent general election .
the new government was formed by the military government in civil uniform , and there is no change . " dr runbik , a supporter of the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- has a similar attitude : " yes , there is hope and there is excitement .
of course , we don ’ t know about the future .
if she is not arrested again and if she is well , we have some hope . " tint swe , an nld mp who has lived in india for over two decades , thinks suu kyi 's release and the recent elections could open up the path to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have said the elections in myanmar were rigged " we are coming to the second phase of the struggle , " he explains .
" we have new challenges and i am also hoping for new opportunities .
we will have suu kyi taking the lead and i am sure she will take new initiatives .
there is new hope . " figures for number of burmese refugees are unclear the indian government used to be a vocal supporter of aung san suu kyi ’ s democracy movement , but it changed its foreign policy with the introduction of its look east policy in the 1990s and turned towards more intensified engagement with the military junta . however , india remains an important country of refuge for burmese dissidents and members of the opposition . according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees , there are about 3,500 refugees from myanmar in india , with another 4,500 asylum seekers .
however , unofficially , about 100,000 burmese refugees are thought to be in india , mostly in the north-eastern states . speculation and rumors aung san suu kyi ’ s release has already stirred up much speculation about the country 's future . bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi is a beacon of hope there are some reports that her expressed willingness to consider calling for the lifting of sanctions could force western governments to revisit these measures . however , her pledge to look into election fraud and her call for all political prisoners in myanmar to be released , are not likely to please the junta .
there are even rumors that she could end up being rearrested . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.11.2010 sing-along berlin ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is berlin 's status as europe 's unofficial capital of cool under threat as the city rides an enthusiastic wave of karaoke fever ?
dw 's gavin blackburn and the rest of the city certainly do n't think so . karaoke has been around for a long time and , for many , does n't figure too highly on the list of credible pastimes .
the craze for singing badly to your favorite pop songs started in japan , spread throughout europe in the early 1990s and has been pretty much a drunken joke ever since . in the uk , where i come from , karaoke was one of those things you always went to but never participated in .
some balding , middle-aged , former cruise ship entertainer would set up his tv screen and piffling speakers and stumble through a couple of tom jones numbers until the tipsy housewives were brave enough to teeter to the stage and warble their way through " i will survive . "
woeful in the extreme . however , in the last year or so , berliners have rediscovered and reinvented karaoke to the extent that it is rapidly gaining legendary status as a credible and fun way to spend an evening .
while its popularity may surprise many , given the city 's reputation for being three-quarters full with po-faced hipsters who try to out-bore each other at parties , it 's not all that much of a shock to me .
i have seen the cool facade before . every now and again , the real personality of berliners flashes through . the fall of the cool facade i recall being at a see-and-be-seen party a couple of years back where all those who were n't making some token effort to vaguely sway to the monotonous pseudo-techno music , were standing around the fringes like mourners at a state funeral . the dj decided , for reasons unknown even to eminent scientists , to play " i 've had the time of my life " from " dirty dancing . "
it was as if the entire club had received a massive electric shock .
the zombified clubbers on the dance floor suddenly sprang to life , while those morose shop-window dummies around the edges leapt onto the dance floor like someone had just whacked them on the bottom with a spade .
i myself stood nodding sagely in the corner , safe in the knowledge that berliners are n't really as cool as they would have us all think . therefore karaoke 's success here is scarcely surprising .
in the summer months , locals amass in prenzlauer berg 's mauerpark in their thousands to take part in the daytime open-air karaoke , which has now taken on stadium-like proportions .
dedicated karaoke bars - bars which run regular karaoke nights - are springing up in numbers which could even rival the dog piles on the city 's streets . bildunterschrift : fancy yourself as the next tokio hotel ?
at a karaoke bar , you can be your favorite star - at least for a night the moment of conversion " come on , it 'll be fun .
it 's like being a pop star for a night ! " enthused a pal of mine , eagerly trying to convince me to join her at one of berlin 's most popular karaoke hang-outs , monster ronsons .
it was sunday night and at this time , as an alternative to hiring a private karaoke cabin , you can also sing on stage .
so , i went along not expecting very much and came away a 100-percent karaoke convert . the only song i know i can sing reasonably well is " mack the knife " by bobby darin and , figuring that if i were to go on the stage at all , i might as well not make a spectacle of myself . " given that you 're wearing a sailor shirt and knickerbockers , some might argue it 's already too late for that , " quipped my friend shortly before mysteriously acquiring something vaguely resembling a black eye . finally , after about 14 bracing beers and what seemed like an eternity , my name was called and away i went .
standing there under the spotlights , clicking my fingers and occasionally swinging my hips , i might well have been in the rat pack .
i did n't need the lyrics ; the stage - and the song - were all mine . as i hit the big finish high note at the end of the song , to say the applause was rapturous would have been an understatement .
i never heard such whooping and cheering for anything i 'd done since the day i threw a tennis ball at mrs. murphy in seventh grade french class . the berlin touch and this is where karaoke differs in berlin : whether you can sing or barely croak through your song of choice , the assembled audience will clap and cheer and dance along to your efforts , so even those with the most miserable of singing voices need n't feel embarrassed to have a go . it 's just typical of berlin to take something tatty and turn it into something quite wonderful .
now if only they could work the same magic on " dirty dancing . " gavin 's dreams of a career change were dashed when a talent agent advised him that touring a one-man show was fine , but touring with only one song would be unwise . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.11.2010 us truce with international criminal court paves way for cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war crimes tribunals like the icc seek to end impunity from the law after years of open hostility , the us and the international criminal court have agreed to an uneasy truce .
can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
as the administration under george w. bush unilaterally waged its controversial " war on terror , " us policymakers worried that the military had become vulnerable to politically motivated indictments by the icc .
they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

woeful in the extreme . however , in the last year or so , berliners have rediscovered and reinvented karaoke to the extent that it is rapidly gaining legendary status as a credible and fun way to spend an evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.11.2010 us truce with international criminal court paves way for cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war crimes tribunals like the icc seek to end impunity from the law after years of open hostility , the us and the international criminal court have agreed to an uneasy truce .
can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
as the administration under george w. bush unilaterally waged its controversial " war on terror , " us policymakers worried that the military had become vulnerable to politically motivated indictments by the icc .
they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , her supporters are aware that their struggle is far from over . it is celebration time for the burmese community in new delhi that has organized a sports carnival to mark the recent release of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi after years of house arrest . the burmese refugees - many of whom made india their home after having to flee myanmar - have organized volleyball and football competitions to mark the long-awaited occasion .
they have invited the united nations high commissioner for refugees to be their chief guest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delhi has become a home for hundreds of burmese refugees mixed sentiments van hmun lian , one of the sports festival organizers , has mixed sentiments : " we are very happy and we are celebrating aung san suu kyi ’ s release but i don ’ t think we will be able to go back to our country very soon .
her release is diverting people ’ s attention from the rigged and fraudulent general election .
the new government was formed by the military government in civil uniform , and there is no change . " dr runbik , a supporter of the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- has a similar attitude : " yes , there is hope and there is excitement .
of course , we don ’ t know about the future .
if she is not arrested again and if she is well , we have some hope . " tint swe , an nld mp who has lived in india for over two decades , thinks suu kyi 's release and the recent elections could open up the path to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many have said the elections in myanmar were rigged " we are coming to the second phase of the struggle , " he explains .
" we have new challenges and i am also hoping for new opportunities .
we will have suu kyi taking the lead and i am sure she will take new initiatives .
there is new hope .

" i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .

the dw experts will go to any lengths to get you the match day predictions .
however , all this dabbling in the occult can be tiring so they 've taken a more peaceful approach for week 13 . this predicting lark may seem like a piece of cake to the untrained eye .
for the layman , it must seem that sitting around , plucking random scores form the ether while keeping one eye on the television is a moderately relaxing past-time .
considering how wrong we sometimes get it , it can also appear to be an exercise undertaken with a laissez-faire attitude from the comfort of a well-padded sofa .
in reality , it 's quite a stressful affair .
delving into various dark arts every week , communicating with malevolent soccer spirits in a variety of cod-supernatural rituals can have quite a taxing effect on a pundit - which is why we 've taken off to a cave with our yogi to try and forecast the results for match day thirteen from a state of spiritual nirvana .

saturday , nov .
20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

new measures such as lower defense spending , pensions freezes and further cuts to government waste are meant to shrink the deficit by 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.9 billion -rrb- next year .
this would reduce the deficit to 16.8 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 percent of gdp -rrb- and bring it in line with the terms of the bailout deal .
sales tax will increase by 2 percent to 13 percent - after already being raised twice this year .
waste in the health sector will be specifically targeted .
athens said it would miss the targets for 2010 , blaming a deeper than expected recession and fiscal slippages .
however , it plans to catch up in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austerity measures have already led to several strikes " we have not yet won the battle but we are now in a better position to deal with the real problems ... a wasteful state , problematic state companies and tax evasion , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference after submitting the budget to parliament .
feared union backlash in response to the budget , the public sector labor union said it would join private sector workers in a 24-hour general strike planned for december 15 .
" unprecedented austerity will hurt all civil servants and private sector workers , with no exception , " the head of the private sector union gsee , yannis panagopoulos , said in a statement .
under the 2011 budget , the government expects unemployment to rise to 14.6 percent from an estimated 12.1 percent this year .
the budget will be discussed in parliament and changes can be made before a final vote on december 22 .
the government has a comfortable majority and is expected to pass the budget easily .

up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .

the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

" france can not accept that its policy be dictated by anyone outside , " new foreign minister michele alliot-marie said in a statement after abdelmalek droukdel , head of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , made the demands in an audio recording on thursday .

the recording , broadcast by arab satellite network al jazeera , said that to ensure the hostages ' safety , france must " hasten and take -lsb- its -rsb- soldiers out of afghanistan according to a specific timetable that -lsb- france announces -rsb- officially . "
bin laden , in a recording aired by al jazeera in late october , also said france 's security would be compromised if it did not pull its 3,750 soldiers out of afghanistan .
he told france to treat the kidnapping as a warning and that a ban on the wearing of the burqa in public places in france justified violence against its citizens .
new reference to bin laden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostage-takers said france should negotiate with bin laden directly droukdel , alias abou moussaab abdelouadoud , also said that " any form of negotiations on this issue in the future will be done with no one other than our sheikh osama bin laden ... and according to his terms . "
former defense minister herve morin , who was closely following the hostage crisis until losing his portfolio during a reshuffle last week , said the reference to bin laden in thursday 's recording was new .
" withdrawing french troops from afghanistan is a kind of classic , traditional demand for all kinds of attacks , " he told france info radio .
" what 's new is the reference to bin laden .
generally , and particularly with aqim , it 's more of a franchise .
there is n't an al qaeda kind of holding company with a number of subsidiaries .
it 's not as structured as that . "
france said for the first time wednesday that it was in touch with the aqim kidnappers .
" of course there are all kinds of contact -lsb- with the hostage-takers -rsb- , new defense minister alain juppe told europe 1 radio , without giving more details .
" all the -lsb- french -rsb- authorities , the defense ministry , the foreign ministry , everyone is being extremely vigilant to make the necessary contact , " he said .
presumed safe asked if the hostages were believed to be safe , juppe added that there was " currently ... every reason to believe they are . "
the five french hostages were seized in niger in september along with a togolese and a madagascan and are believed to be held in neighboring mali .
the french hostages are an engineer working for nuclear giant areva and his wife , and several employees of a subcontractor .
president nicolas sarkozy on tuesday said he was " especially worried " about the hostages , but also said threats would not change french policy .

it originally set out to be the anti-party party .
now , 30 years later after the party was founded , they 're a force to be reckoned with . west germany was ripe for the founding of the green party in 1980 .
there had been a lack of a serious political opposition during the 1970s and many intellectuals found the political system of then-west germany to lean too far to the right .
at the same time , new social movements were bringing the environment , women 's issues , peace and civil rights into focus after having been largely ignored by the main parties .
the green party was going to reform the system from within .
" we 're switching to the greens .
the only alternative .
we 're voting for the greens . "
with this slightly awkward slogan , the greens began their first election campaign in 1980 .
shortly before , the party had been founded at a national level in karlsruhe .
the party had its roots in the environmental movement , the anti-nuclear movement and civil society .
other issues key to the early greens included questions about arms buildup and the nato double track decision , which allowed for the stationing of american missiles in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele is still fighting for the greens ' causes 30 years later " there were serious problems in our society , " said hans-christian stroebele , a founding member of the greens and , at 74-years-old , the oldest member of parliament for the greens .
“ there was the threat of a nuclear-arms race and the destruction of the planet . ”
the new party was formed as a result of criticism of the party system itself .
the greens wanted to do everything differently from how the established parties did things .
they saw themselves as the anti-party party .
they wanted their own organization to be more democratic , pluralistic and transparent .
to achieve this they introduced a number of strict rules that were only slowly abandoned over the years through struggles from within the party .
for example , originally , elected members of parliament were meant to give up their seats after two years to another party member as part of a rotation system meant to enforce a strict separation between the power of office and the mandate from the people .
both genders and different factions of the party had to be equally represented .
even today the parliamentary group has two co-leaders , one of whom must be a woman .
the colorful oddballs enter parliament in the 1980 elections , however , the greens only won a disappointing 1.5 percent of the vote .
but when an early election was called in 1983 , they managed to get over the 5-percent hurdle to entering the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their long hair and casual clothing , the greens brought an irreverent attitude to politics while the elected members from the other parties met for a church service before the first session of the new parliament , the greens rolled a globe through the center of bonn , then the capital of west germany , and they carried flowers and branches into the bundestag .
with their casual clothing , beards and long hair , the greens brought a little color into the normally dignified gray of the chamber .
but it was n't the way the greens looked that was important , said stroebele .
" what was important were the new topics being addressed from the lectern . "
at first the other parties found it difficult to work with these newcomers to the bundestag .
only over time did they accept the greens and integrate them into the parliamentary process .
in 1990 , however , the greens suffered a setback .
after reunification , they did n't make it over that 5-percent hurdle .
only by joining up with the alliance 90 movement from the eastern german states were they able to secure their spot in the bundestag .
the rise of joschka fischer the early 1990s were a time of reorientation for the party .
internal disputes led several prominent left-leaning green politicians , known as the fundamentalists , to leave the party .
the so-called realists won out in the end with joschka fischer playing a significant role in determining the direction of the party at this time .
fischer had gotten government experience after his time as hessen 's environment minister beginning in 1985 .
in 1994 , he became of one the co-leaders of the greens ’ parliamentary group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an anti-authoritarian in his youth , fischer would lead the greens into government at a party conference in bremen in 1995 , fischer broke a green party taboo , arguing in favor of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , taking part in foreign military missions .
the war in bosnia and the massacre of muslim men and boys in the un-protected zone of srbenica led fischer to move away from the traditionally staunch pacifism of the greens .
after the parliamentary election of 1998 , the greens joined the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in a coalition government and fischer became the country 's foreign minister .
in this new role he had to take some responsibility for germany 's participation in the kosovo war .
this change of course led to bitter arguments with the party base , which was n't ready to endorse the militarization of germany 's foreign policy .
at a special party conference in bielefeld in 1999 things got downright tumultuous , and fischer was hit in the head with a red paint bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer took a lot of flak for his support for germany sending troops to kosovo " this is a war , " the then foreign minister explained to his party at the conference .
" i never dreamed that this coalition of social democrats and greens would be at war .
but this war has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and that 's the point where the greens can no longer be considered a protest party . "
in the end , the party members gave fischer their support and a collapse of the spd-green coalition was avoided .
the biggest victory for the greens during their time in the government was the agreement to phase out nuclear energy use in germany .
after the 2005 elections , the greens went back to being in the opposition .
in 2009 the party received its best election results yet , winning 10.7 percent of the vote .
since then their position in the opinion polls has continued to rise .
in some regions the greens have long beat out the spd in popularity and are seen as the main left-leaning party .
according to stroebele , in some parts of berlin the greens are more popular than any other party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.11.2010 us truce with international criminal court paves way for cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war crimes tribunals like the icc seek to end impunity from the law after years of open hostility , the us and the international criminal court have agreed to an uneasy truce .
can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
as the administration under george w. bush unilaterally waged its controversial " war on terror , " us policymakers worried that the military had become vulnerable to politically motivated indictments by the icc .
they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
as the administration under george w. bush unilaterally waged its controversial " war on terror , " us policymakers worried that the military had become vulnerable to politically motivated indictments by the icc .
they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "

the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .

tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

new measures such as lower defense spending , pensions freezes and further cuts to government waste are meant to shrink the deficit by 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.9 billion -rrb- next year .
this would reduce the deficit to 16.8 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 percent of gdp -rrb- and bring it in line with the terms of the bailout deal .
sales tax will increase by 2 percent to 13 percent - after already being raised twice this year .
waste in the health sector will be specifically targeted .
athens said it would miss the targets for 2010 , blaming a deeper than expected recession and fiscal slippages .
however , it plans to catch up in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austerity measures have already led to several strikes " we have not yet won the battle but we are now in a better position to deal with the real problems ... a wasteful state , problematic state companies and tax evasion , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference after submitting the budget to parliament .
feared union backlash in response to the budget , the public sector labor union said it would join private sector workers in a 24-hour general strike planned for december 15 .
" unprecedented austerity will hurt all civil servants and private sector workers , with no exception , " the head of the private sector union gsee , yannis panagopoulos , said in a statement .
under the 2011 budget , the government expects unemployment to rise to 14.6 percent from an estimated 12.1 percent this year .
the budget will be discussed in parliament and changes can be made before a final vote on december 22 .
the government has a comfortable majority and is expected to pass the budget easily .

the visit will most likely happen in september . arrangements for pope benedict xvi 's first official visit to his home country are under way , after the pontiff accepted the invitation of german president christian wulff .
the pope will travel to the archdioceses of berlin , freiburg and erfurt in late 2011 , according to a statement from the german episcopal conference .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the chairman of the conference , said the visit would be " an important moment in the life of our country . "
" i am firmly convinced that he will be a strong inspiration for many people , " zollitsch added .
first official visit the planned visit will be benedict 's first official trip to germany , although he made appearances in cologne while it was hosting world youth day in 2005 and in his native bavaria in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people are expected to pay tribute during a state visit the invitation was extended by christian wulff in october .
" it is a particularly special pleasure and honor for me and many people in our country to welcome the holy father to his home country in the 60th anniversary year of his ordination to the priesthood , " wulff said .
the election of then cardinal joseph ratzinger in april 2005 to succeed the late pope john paul ii was a source of great pride in germany - which is about 30 percent catholic .
the last official papal visit to germany was by pope john paul ii in 1996 . sexual abuse victims still waiting the pontiff is likely to receive a cooler reception from german victims of sexual abuse by priests of the roman catholic church . not much has been done after zollitsch announced in september that the church was preparing compensation payments for abuse victims . the german church has admitted it had failed to properly investigate claims of abuse , simply moving pedophile priests to another diocese instead of reporting them to the police .
the pope himself has faced allegations that he , as cardinal joseph ratzinger , failed to act against molesting priests while he was heading the vatican morals watchdog . author : catherine bolsover , sarah steffen -lrb- afp , ap , epd -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

the hostage-takers said france must negotiate the release of hostages with osama bin laden directly . france on friday rejected demands from an al qaeda cell holding five french hostages in northern africa that it should negotiate their freedom with osama bin laden and pull its troops out of afghanistan .
" france can not accept that its policy be dictated by anyone outside , " new foreign minister michele alliot-marie said in a statement after abdelmalek droukdel , head of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , made the demands in an audio recording on thursday .
the message listed demands to secure the release of five french hostages seized in niger in september along with a togolese and a madagascan .
the recording , broadcast by arab satellite network al jazeera , said that to ensure the hostages ' safety , france must " hasten and take -lsb- its -rsb- soldiers out of afghanistan according to a specific timetable that -lsb- france announces -rsb- officially . "
bin laden , in a recording aired by al jazeera in late october , also said france 's security would be compromised if it did not pull its 3,750 soldiers out of afghanistan .
he told france to treat the kidnapping as a warning and that a ban on the wearing of the burqa in public places in france justified violence against its citizens .
new reference to bin laden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostage-takers said france should negotiate with bin laden directly droukdel , alias abou moussaab abdelouadoud , also said that " any form of negotiations on this issue in the future will be done with no one other than our sheikh osama bin laden ... and according to his terms . "
former defense minister herve morin , who was closely following the hostage crisis until losing his portfolio during a reshuffle last week , said the reference to bin laden in thursday 's recording was new .
" withdrawing french troops from afghanistan is a kind of classic , traditional demand for all kinds of attacks , " he told france info radio .
" what 's new is the reference to bin laden .
generally , and particularly with aqim , it 's more of a franchise .
there is n't an al qaeda kind of holding company with a number of subsidiaries .
it 's not as structured as that . "
france said for the first time wednesday that it was in touch with the aqim kidnappers .
" of course there are all kinds of contact -lsb- with the hostage-takers -rsb- , new defense minister alain juppe told europe 1 radio , without giving more details .
" all the -lsb- french -rsb- authorities , the defense ministry , the foreign ministry , everyone is being extremely vigilant to make the necessary contact , " he said .
presumed safe asked if the hostages were believed to be safe , juppe added that there was " currently ... every reason to believe they are . "
the five french hostages were seized in niger in september along with a togolese and a madagascan and are believed to be held in neighboring mali .
the french hostages are an engineer working for nuclear giant areva and his wife , and several employees of a subcontractor .
president nicolas sarkozy on tuesday said he was " especially worried " about the hostages , but also said threats would not change french policy .

investigations have begun to find out who bought and planted the case . a suspected bomb intercepted in namibia that was to be put on a munich-bound plane was only " a dummy " used to test security checks , the german interior minister said friday .
thomas de maiziere said it was a " so-called real test suitcase " made by a company in the united states that makes alarm and detection systems .
" these real test suitcases are built to test security measures , " de maiziere said .
at no time would the device have presented a danger to the passengers on the air berlin flight to munich , he added .

this was before the suspect package was found at windhoek airport in namibia .
on friday , authorities said germany was likely to remain on heightened alert for the rest of the year .
police chief matthias seeger was quoted in the daily bild newspaper as saying the danger of attack is greater than ever before .
" on a scale of one - no danger - to 10 - acute danger of attack - we are currently at 9 , " seeger said .
however , authorities have been quick to reassure the public that there is no cause for panic .
security at airports and railway stations has been tightened and experts have warned that traditional christmas markets across the country could be targeted .

" it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 19.11.2010 germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland needs billions of euros to cover its huge debt a german government spokesman said ireland should be allowed to determine its own corporation tax rate , despite recent pressure from a senior finance expert in chancellor angela merkel 's party . government spokesman steffen seibert friday countered statements made earlier this week by michael meister , one of angela merkel 's senior financial advisers . asked whether germany wanted ireland to raise its corporate tax rate , seibert said this was a matter to be decided by the irish government .
meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saturday , nov .
20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 19.11.2010 germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland needs billions of euros to cover its huge debt a german government spokesman said ireland should be allowed to determine its own corporation tax rate , despite recent pressure from a senior finance expert in chancellor angela merkel 's party . government spokesman steffen seibert friday countered statements made earlier this week by michael meister , one of angela merkel 's senior financial advisers . asked whether germany wanted ireland to raise its corporate tax rate , seibert said this was a matter to be decided by the irish government .
meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
as the administration under george w. bush unilaterally waged its controversial " war on terror , " us policymakers worried that the military had become vulnerable to politically motivated indictments by the icc .
they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

the hostage-takers said france must negotiate the release of hostages with osama bin laden directly . france on friday rejected demands from an al qaeda cell holding five french hostages in northern africa that it should negotiate their freedom with osama bin laden and pull its troops out of afghanistan .
" france can not accept that its policy be dictated by anyone outside , " new foreign minister michele alliot-marie said in a statement after abdelmalek droukdel , head of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , made the demands in an audio recording on thursday .
the message listed demands to secure the release of five french hostages seized in niger in september along with a togolese and a madagascan .
the recording , broadcast by arab satellite network al jazeera , said that to ensure the hostages ' safety , france must " hasten and take -lsb- its -rsb- soldiers out of afghanistan according to a specific timetable that -lsb- france announces -rsb- officially . "
bin laden , in a recording aired by al jazeera in late october , also said france 's security would be compromised if it did not pull its 3,750 soldiers out of afghanistan .
he told france to treat the kidnapping as a warning and that a ban on the wearing of the burqa in public places in france justified violence against its citizens .
new reference to bin laden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostage-takers said france should negotiate with bin laden directly droukdel , alias abou moussaab abdelouadoud , also said that " any form of negotiations on this issue in the future will be done with no one other than our sheikh osama bin laden ... and according to his terms . "
former defense minister herve morin , who was closely following the hostage crisis until losing his portfolio during a reshuffle last week , said the reference to bin laden in thursday 's recording was new .
" withdrawing french troops from afghanistan is a kind of classic , traditional demand for all kinds of attacks , " he told france info radio .
" what 's new is the reference to bin laden .
generally , and particularly with aqim , it 's more of a franchise .
there is n't an al qaeda kind of holding company with a number of subsidiaries .
it 's not as structured as that . "
france said for the first time wednesday that it was in touch with the aqim kidnappers .
" of course there are all kinds of contact -lsb- with the hostage-takers -rsb- , new defense minister alain juppe told europe 1 radio , without giving more details .
" all the -lsb- french -rsb- authorities , the defense ministry , the foreign ministry , everyone is being extremely vigilant to make the necessary contact , " he said .
presumed safe asked if the hostages were believed to be safe , juppe added that there was " currently ... every reason to believe they are . "
the five french hostages were seized in niger in september along with a togolese and a madagascan and are believed to be held in neighboring mali .
the french hostages are an engineer working for nuclear giant areva and his wife , and several employees of a subcontractor .
president nicolas sarkozy on tuesday said he was " especially worried " about the hostages , but also said threats would not change french policy .

however , her supporters are aware that their struggle is far from over . it is celebration time for the burmese community in new delhi that has organized a sports carnival to mark the recent release of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi after years of house arrest . the burmese refugees - many of whom made india their home after having to flee myanmar - have organized volleyball and football competitions to mark the long-awaited occasion .

her release is diverting people ’ s attention from the rigged and fraudulent general election .
the new government was formed by the military government in civil uniform , and there is no change . " dr runbik , a supporter of the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- has a similar attitude : " yes , there is hope and there is excitement .

there is new hope . " figures for number of burmese refugees are unclear the indian government used to be a vocal supporter of aung san suu kyi ’ s democracy movement , but it changed its foreign policy with the introduction of its look east policy in the 1990s and turned towards more intensified engagement with the military junta . however , india remains an important country of refuge for burmese dissidents and members of the opposition . according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees , there are about 3,500 refugees from myanmar in india , with another 4,500 asylum seekers .
however , unofficially , about 100,000 burmese refugees are thought to be in india , mostly in the north-eastern states . speculation and rumors aung san suu kyi ’ s release has already stirred up much speculation about the country 's future . bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi is a beacon of hope there are some reports that her expressed willingness to consider calling for the lifting of sanctions could force western governments to revisit these measures . however , her pledge to look into election fraud and her call for all political prisoners in myanmar to be released , are not likely to please the junta .

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

new measures such as lower defense spending , pensions freezes and further cuts to government waste are meant to shrink the deficit by 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.9 billion -rrb- next year .
this would reduce the deficit to 16.8 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 percent of gdp -rrb- and bring it in line with the terms of the bailout deal .
sales tax will increase by 2 percent to 13 percent - after already being raised twice this year .
waste in the health sector will be specifically targeted .
athens said it would miss the targets for 2010 , blaming a deeper than expected recession and fiscal slippages .
however , it plans to catch up in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austerity measures have already led to several strikes " we have not yet won the battle but we are now in a better position to deal with the real problems ... a wasteful state , problematic state companies and tax evasion , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference after submitting the budget to parliament .
feared union backlash in response to the budget , the public sector labor union said it would join private sector workers in a 24-hour general strike planned for december 15 .
" unprecedented austerity will hurt all civil servants and private sector workers , with no exception , " the head of the private sector union gsee , yannis panagopoulos , said in a statement .
under the 2011 budget , the government expects unemployment to rise to 14.6 percent from an estimated 12.1 percent this year .
the budget will be discussed in parliament and changes can be made before a final vote on december 22 .
the government has a comfortable majority and is expected to pass the budget easily .

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

however , her supporters are aware that their struggle is far from over . it is celebration time for the burmese community in new delhi that has organized a sports carnival to mark the recent release of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi after years of house arrest . the burmese refugees - many of whom made india their home after having to flee myanmar - have organized volleyball and football competitions to mark the long-awaited occasion .

her release is diverting people ’ s attention from the rigged and fraudulent general election .

there is new hope . " figures for number of burmese refugees are unclear the indian government used to be a vocal supporter of aung san suu kyi ’ s democracy movement , but it changed its foreign policy with the introduction of its look east policy in the 1990s and turned towards more intensified engagement with the military junta . however , india remains an important country of refuge for burmese dissidents and members of the opposition . according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees , there are about 3,500 refugees from myanmar in india , with another 4,500 asylum seekers .
however , unofficially , about 100,000 burmese refugees are thought to be in india , mostly in the north-eastern states . speculation and rumors aung san suu kyi ’ s release has already stirred up much speculation about the country 's future . bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi is a beacon of hope there are some reports that her expressed willingness to consider calling for the lifting of sanctions could force western governments to revisit these measures . however , her pledge to look into election fraud and her call for all political prisoners in myanmar to be released , are not likely to please the junta .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

while live debates among candidates will be broadcast for the first time , analysts doubt whether the elections will truly be free and fair . the electoral commission in belarus has completed the registration of a record number of 10 candidates for the presidential election on december 19 , with incumbent alexander lukashenko showing no signs of relinquishing power .
the outcome of a recent opinion poll showed the president 's approval rating has dropped to a historic low , with just over 31 percent of the respondents saying they would support lukashenko in the upcoming elections .
that is still far more than any of the nine alternative candidates , who got between 2 and 11 percent .
the divided opposition faces an uphill battle in finding a solid joint candidate that could pose a serious challenge for lukashenko .
one of the candidates , poet vladimir neklayev , visited poland on thursday and met with foreign minister radoslaw sikorski , who said poland stood " in solidarity with the belarusian people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition candidate neklayev traveled to poland ahead of the election " if these elections are fair then poland is ready - whoever the winner is - to be an advocate for belarus in europe , " polish news agency pap quoted sikorski as saying .
" we 're belarus ' neighbor , we consider it a european country , and we want it to respect european rules .
democracy is n't just about the actual vote , but also press freedom and access to election commissions . "
live television debates lukashenko , in power since 1994 , has marked his presidency with suppression of dissent and independent media .
yet in an apparent effort to prove the upcoming election 's legitimacy , the electoral commission has decided that candidates would have the possibility to speak and hold debates live on radio and television .
" in the past the candidates more than once demanded this , but i think that not many candidates will want to speak live on television , " said lidia yermoshina , head of the commission .
" that is a great responsibility , it 's difficult .
-lsb- the idea of -rsb- holding live debates was proposed by the organization for security and cooperation in europe , and that is a common international practice . "
the debates appear to be aimed at the west , which is closely following events in the country , often dubbed the last dictatorship in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition activists have little faith in the election 's integrity no interest in opposition lukashenko will be the fourth candidate to speak on television .
he has said he is convinced he will win the elections once again , and told a press conference earlier this fall that the opposition did not interest him at all .
" i do n't even know who supports them , " he said .
" you must understand that if i would try to get to know more about all these things , i would simply help my opponents gain popularity . "
lukashenko may be in a more awkward situation than he ever was since he came to power .
russia has openly withdrawn its support , and a pricing spat with russian gas company gazprom confirmed that belarus can no longer count on cheap russian energy - bad news for the country 's struggling economy .
improving relations with the european union is thus especially important , and may be a reason for the decision to broadcast live debates .
but despite the facade , lukashenko himself has said he is not interested at all in whether the elections are accepted as free and fair by the outside world .

new measures such as lower defense spending , pensions freezes and further cuts to government waste are meant to shrink the deficit by 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.9 billion -rrb- next year .
this would reduce the deficit to 16.8 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 percent of gdp -rrb- and bring it in line with the terms of the bailout deal .
sales tax will increase by 2 percent to 13 percent - after already being raised twice this year .
waste in the health sector will be specifically targeted .
athens said it would miss the targets for 2010 , blaming a deeper than expected recession and fiscal slippages .
however , it plans to catch up in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austerity measures have already led to several strikes " we have not yet won the battle but we are now in a better position to deal with the real problems ... a wasteful state , problematic state companies and tax evasion , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference after submitting the budget to parliament .
feared union backlash in response to the budget , the public sector labor union said it would join private sector workers in a 24-hour general strike planned for december 15 .
" unprecedented austerity will hurt all civil servants and private sector workers , with no exception , " the head of the private sector union gsee , yannis panagopoulos , said in a statement .
under the 2011 budget , the government expects unemployment to rise to 14.6 percent from an estimated 12.1 percent this year .
the budget will be discussed in parliament and changes can be made before a final vote on december 22 .
the government has a comfortable majority and is expected to pass the budget easily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 nato appears on course for new strategic concept nato -pipe- 19.11.2010 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato fears turkey is getting too close to iran turkey is a key player in nato plans to install a missile shield to defend against a nuclear threat from iran .
but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

new measures such as lower defense spending , pensions freezes and further cuts to government waste are meant to shrink the deficit by 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.9 billion -rrb- next year .
this would reduce the deficit to 16.8 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 percent of gdp -rrb- and bring it in line with the terms of the bailout deal .
sales tax will increase by 2 percent to 13 percent - after already being raised twice this year .
waste in the health sector will be specifically targeted .
athens said it would miss the targets for 2010 , blaming a deeper than expected recession and fiscal slippages .
however , it plans to catch up in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austerity measures have already led to several strikes " we have not yet won the battle but we are now in a better position to deal with the real problems ... a wasteful state , problematic state companies and tax evasion , " greek finance minister george papaconstantinou told a news conference after submitting the budget to parliament .
feared union backlash in response to the budget , the public sector labor union said it would join private sector workers in a 24-hour general strike planned for december 15 .
" unprecedented austerity will hurt all civil servants and private sector workers , with no exception , " the head of the private sector union gsee , yannis panagopoulos , said in a statement .
under the 2011 budget , the government expects unemployment to rise to 14.6 percent from an estimated 12.1 percent this year .
the budget will be discussed in parliament and changes can be made before a final vote on december 22 .
the government has a comfortable majority and is expected to pass the budget easily .

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

the visit will most likely happen in september . arrangements for pope benedict xvi 's first official visit to his home country are under way , after the pontiff accepted the invitation of german president christian wulff .
the pope will travel to the archdioceses of berlin , freiburg and erfurt in late 2011 , according to a statement from the german episcopal conference .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the chairman of the conference , said the visit would be " an important moment in the life of our country . "
" i am firmly convinced that he will be a strong inspiration for many people , " zollitsch added .
first official visit the planned visit will be benedict 's first official trip to germany , although he made appearances in cologne while it was hosting world youth day in 2005 and in his native bavaria in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people are expected to pay tribute during a state visit the invitation was extended by christian wulff in october .
" it is a particularly special pleasure and honor for me and many people in our country to welcome the holy father to his home country in the 60th anniversary year of his ordination to the priesthood , " wulff said .
the election of then cardinal joseph ratzinger in april 2005 to succeed the late pope john paul ii was a source of great pride in germany - which is about 30 percent catholic .
the last official papal visit to germany was by pope john paul ii in 1996 . sexual abuse victims still waiting the pontiff is likely to receive a cooler reception from german victims of sexual abuse by priests of the roman catholic church . not much has been done after zollitsch announced in september that the church was preparing compensation payments for abuse victims . the german church has admitted it had failed to properly investigate claims of abuse , simply moving pedophile priests to another diocese instead of reporting them to the police .
the pope himself has faced allegations that he , as cardinal joseph ratzinger , failed to act against molesting priests while he was heading the vatican morals watchdog . author : catherine bolsover , sarah steffen -lrb- afp , ap , epd -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.11.2010 from radical opposition to mainstream party : the rise of the greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are today an influential party in german politics germany 's green party meets for its annual conference this weekend .
it originally set out to be the anti-party party .
now , 30 years later after the party was founded , they 're a force to be reckoned with . west germany was ripe for the founding of the green party in 1980 .
there had been a lack of a serious political opposition during the 1970s and many intellectuals found the political system of then-west germany to lean too far to the right .
at the same time , new social movements were bringing the environment , women 's issues , peace and civil rights into focus after having been largely ignored by the main parties .
the green party was going to reform the system from within .
" we 're switching to the greens .
the only alternative .
we 're voting for the greens . "
with this slightly awkward slogan , the greens began their first election campaign in 1980 .
shortly before , the party had been founded at a national level in karlsruhe .
the party had its roots in the environmental movement , the anti-nuclear movement and civil society .
other issues key to the early greens included questions about arms buildup and the nato double track decision , which allowed for the stationing of american missiles in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele is still fighting for the greens ' causes 30 years later " there were serious problems in our society , " said hans-christian stroebele , a founding member of the greens and , at 74-years-old , the oldest member of parliament for the greens .
“ there was the threat of a nuclear-arms race and the destruction of the planet . ”
the new party was formed as a result of criticism of the party system itself .
the greens wanted to do everything differently from how the established parties did things .
they saw themselves as the anti-party party .
they wanted their own organization to be more democratic , pluralistic and transparent .
to achieve this they introduced a number of strict rules that were only slowly abandoned over the years through struggles from within the party .
for example , originally , elected members of parliament were meant to give up their seats after two years to another party member as part of a rotation system meant to enforce a strict separation between the power of office and the mandate from the people .
both genders and different factions of the party had to be equally represented .
even today the parliamentary group has two co-leaders , one of whom must be a woman .
the colorful oddballs enter parliament in the 1980 elections , however , the greens only won a disappointing 1.5 percent of the vote .
but when an early election was called in 1983 , they managed to get over the 5-percent hurdle to entering the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their long hair and casual clothing , the greens brought an irreverent attitude to politics while the elected members from the other parties met for a church service before the first session of the new parliament , the greens rolled a globe through the center of bonn , then the capital of west germany , and they carried flowers and branches into the bundestag .
with their casual clothing , beards and long hair , the greens brought a little color into the normally dignified gray of the chamber .
but it was n't the way the greens looked that was important , said stroebele .
" what was important were the new topics being addressed from the lectern . "
at first the other parties found it difficult to work with these newcomers to the bundestag .
only over time did they accept the greens and integrate them into the parliamentary process .
in 1990 , however , the greens suffered a setback .
after reunification , they did n't make it over that 5-percent hurdle .
only by joining up with the alliance 90 movement from the eastern german states were they able to secure their spot in the bundestag .
the rise of joschka fischer the early 1990s were a time of reorientation for the party .
internal disputes led several prominent left-leaning green politicians , known as the fundamentalists , to leave the party .
the so-called realists won out in the end with joschka fischer playing a significant role in determining the direction of the party at this time .
fischer had gotten government experience after his time as hessen 's environment minister beginning in 1985 .
in 1994 , he became of one the co-leaders of the greens ’ parliamentary group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an anti-authoritarian in his youth , fischer would lead the greens into government at a party conference in bremen in 1995 , fischer broke a green party taboo , arguing in favor of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , taking part in foreign military missions .
the war in bosnia and the massacre of muslim men and boys in the un-protected zone of srbenica led fischer to move away from the traditionally staunch pacifism of the greens .
after the parliamentary election of 1998 , the greens joined the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in a coalition government and fischer became the country 's foreign minister .
in this new role he had to take some responsibility for germany 's participation in the kosovo war .
this change of course led to bitter arguments with the party base , which was n't ready to endorse the militarization of germany 's foreign policy .
at a special party conference in bielefeld in 1999 things got downright tumultuous , and fischer was hit in the head with a red paint bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer took a lot of flak for his support for germany sending troops to kosovo " this is a war , " the then foreign minister explained to his party at the conference .
" i never dreamed that this coalition of social democrats and greens would be at war .
but this war has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and that 's the point where the greens can no longer be considered a protest party . "
in the end , the party members gave fischer their support and a collapse of the spd-green coalition was avoided .
the biggest victory for the greens during their time in the government was the agreement to phase out nuclear energy use in germany .
after the 2005 elections , the greens went back to being in the opposition .
in 2009 the party received its best election results yet , winning 10.7 percent of the vote .
since then their position in the opinion polls has continued to rise .
in some regions the greens have long beat out the spd in popularity and are seen as the main left-leaning party .
according to stroebele , in some parts of berlin the greens are more popular than any other party .

the conflict stems from a 2006 eu directive that was overturned in germany earlier this year . as germany copes with new terror threats against the country this week , there have been renewed calls by some german politicians to restore germany 's 2007 data retention law , which was declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court earlier this year .
the law required telecommunications companies to store all e-mail , web traffic , landline and mobile data of each user for six months .
the idea is that through what is known as " data traffic analysis , " authorities can re-construct important information about a suspect given a pattern of phone conversations , text messages or e-mails .
even without the contents of the actual correspondence , law enforcement officials have said that knowing when or where a person made a mobile phone call can be crucial in an investigation .
the ruling relied largely on the argument that the law went against article 10 , paragraph 1 of the german basic law , which protects the secrecy of comunications and describes it as ironclad : " the private exchange of communications is protected against unauthorized interference . "
in the months that followed the march 2010 ruling overturning the law in germany , a political disagreement has broken out among various government ministers , most notably , justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who supports the ruling , and interior minister thomas de maiziere , who supports renewed data retention .
their debate has become yet another area of conflict between their respective parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the fdp , the main coalition partners in the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : law enforcement authorities around europe generally support stronger data retention laws government officials and law enforcement in many european countries , including sweden , have called for longer retention periods and said the saved communications data played important roles in solving serious crimes .
" it is a necessary and effective tool that makes it easier to uncover some crimes , " beatrice ask , sweden 's justice minister , told reporters in stockholm earlier this month .
however , there have been reports of abuse , which is precisely what internet and privacy advocates have warned against . in a report issued in july , the european data protection supervisor in brussels said telecom companies were saving and handing over data in ways that contradicted the directive and infringed on individuals ' privacy . " the data retention directive is a totally failed initiative , " joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative told deutsche welle .
" the european commission has had to postpone its report on its implementation repeatedly because it can not find evidence to justify its existence . " in response to questions from national governments and the european parliament , the european commission has agreed to reevaluate the directive .

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .

in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .

the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .

the dw experts will go to any lengths to get you the match day predictions .
however , all this dabbling in the occult can be tiring so they 've taken a more peaceful approach for week 13 . this predicting lark may seem like a piece of cake to the untrained eye .
for the layman , it must seem that sitting around , plucking random scores form the ether while keeping one eye on the television is a moderately relaxing past-time .
considering how wrong we sometimes get it , it can also appear to be an exercise undertaken with a laissez-faire attitude from the comfort of a well-padded sofa .
in reality , it 's quite a stressful affair .
delving into various dark arts every week , communicating with malevolent soccer spirits in a variety of cod-supernatural rituals can have quite a taxing effect on a pundit - which is why we 've taken off to a cave with our yogi to try and forecast the results for match day thirteen from a state of spiritual nirvana .
altogether now : ommmmm ...
saturday , nov .
20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .

however , her supporters are aware that their struggle is far from over . it is celebration time for the burmese community in new delhi that has organized a sports carnival to mark the recent release of myanmar 's pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi after years of house arrest . the burmese refugees - many of whom made india their home after having to flee myanmar - have organized volleyball and football competitions to mark the long-awaited occasion .

there is new hope . " figures for number of burmese refugees are unclear the indian government used to be a vocal supporter of aung san suu kyi ’ s democracy movement , but it changed its foreign policy with the introduction of its look east policy in the 1990s and turned towards more intensified engagement with the military junta . however , india remains an important country of refuge for burmese dissidents and members of the opposition . according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees , there are about 3,500 refugees from myanmar in india , with another 4,500 asylum seekers .
however , unofficially , about 100,000 burmese refugees are thought to be in india , mostly in the north-eastern states . speculation and rumors aung san suu kyi ’ s release has already stirred up much speculation about the country 's future . bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi is a beacon of hope there are some reports that her expressed willingness to consider calling for the lifting of sanctions could force western governments to revisit these measures . however , her pledge to look into election fraud and her call for all political prisoners in myanmar to be released , are not likely to please the junta .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 19.11.2010 germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland needs billions of euros to cover its huge debt a german government spokesman said ireland should be allowed to determine its own corporation tax rate , despite recent pressure from a senior finance expert in chancellor angela merkel 's party . government spokesman steffen seibert friday countered statements made earlier this week by michael meister , one of angela merkel 's senior financial advisers . asked whether germany wanted ireland to raise its corporate tax rate , seibert said this was a matter to be decided by the irish government .
meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

saturday , nov .
20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.11.2010 from radical opposition to mainstream party : the rise of the greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are today an influential party in german politics germany 's green party meets for its annual conference this weekend .
it originally set out to be the anti-party party .
now , 30 years later after the party was founded , they 're a force to be reckoned with . west germany was ripe for the founding of the green party in 1980 .
there had been a lack of a serious political opposition during the 1970s and many intellectuals found the political system of then-west germany to lean too far to the right .
at the same time , new social movements were bringing the environment , women 's issues , peace and civil rights into focus after having been largely ignored by the main parties .
the green party was going to reform the system from within .
" we 're switching to the greens .
the only alternative .
we 're voting for the greens . "
with this slightly awkward slogan , the greens began their first election campaign in 1980 .
shortly before , the party had been founded at a national level in karlsruhe .
the party had its roots in the environmental movement , the anti-nuclear movement and civil society .
other issues key to the early greens included questions about arms buildup and the nato double track decision , which allowed for the stationing of american missiles in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele is still fighting for the greens ' causes 30 years later " there were serious problems in our society , " said hans-christian stroebele , a founding member of the greens and , at 74-years-old , the oldest member of parliament for the greens .
“ there was the threat of a nuclear-arms race and the destruction of the planet . ”
the new party was formed as a result of criticism of the party system itself .
the greens wanted to do everything differently from how the established parties did things .
they saw themselves as the anti-party party .
they wanted their own organization to be more democratic , pluralistic and transparent .
to achieve this they introduced a number of strict rules that were only slowly abandoned over the years through struggles from within the party .
for example , originally , elected members of parliament were meant to give up their seats after two years to another party member as part of a rotation system meant to enforce a strict separation between the power of office and the mandate from the people .
both genders and different factions of the party had to be equally represented .
even today the parliamentary group has two co-leaders , one of whom must be a woman .
the colorful oddballs enter parliament in the 1980 elections , however , the greens only won a disappointing 1.5 percent of the vote .
but when an early election was called in 1983 , they managed to get over the 5-percent hurdle to entering the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their long hair and casual clothing , the greens brought an irreverent attitude to politics while the elected members from the other parties met for a church service before the first session of the new parliament , the greens rolled a globe through the center of bonn , then the capital of west germany , and they carried flowers and branches into the bundestag .
with their casual clothing , beards and long hair , the greens brought a little color into the normally dignified gray of the chamber .
but it was n't the way the greens looked that was important , said stroebele .
" what was important were the new topics being addressed from the lectern . "
at first the other parties found it difficult to work with these newcomers to the bundestag .
only over time did they accept the greens and integrate them into the parliamentary process .
in 1990 , however , the greens suffered a setback .
after reunification , they did n't make it over that 5-percent hurdle .
only by joining up with the alliance 90 movement from the eastern german states were they able to secure their spot in the bundestag .
the rise of joschka fischer the early 1990s were a time of reorientation for the party .
internal disputes led several prominent left-leaning green politicians , known as the fundamentalists , to leave the party .
the so-called realists won out in the end with joschka fischer playing a significant role in determining the direction of the party at this time .
fischer had gotten government experience after his time as hessen 's environment minister beginning in 1985 .
in 1994 , he became of one the co-leaders of the greens ’ parliamentary group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an anti-authoritarian in his youth , fischer would lead the greens into government at a party conference in bremen in 1995 , fischer broke a green party taboo , arguing in favor of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , taking part in foreign military missions .
the war in bosnia and the massacre of muslim men and boys in the un-protected zone of srbenica led fischer to move away from the traditionally staunch pacifism of the greens .
after the parliamentary election of 1998 , the greens joined the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in a coalition government and fischer became the country 's foreign minister .
in this new role he had to take some responsibility for germany 's participation in the kosovo war .
this change of course led to bitter arguments with the party base , which was n't ready to endorse the militarization of germany 's foreign policy .
at a special party conference in bielefeld in 1999 things got downright tumultuous , and fischer was hit in the head with a red paint bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer took a lot of flak for his support for germany sending troops to kosovo " this is a war , " the then foreign minister explained to his party at the conference .
" i never dreamed that this coalition of social democrats and greens would be at war .
but this war has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and that 's the point where the greens can no longer be considered a protest party . "
in the end , the party members gave fischer their support and a collapse of the spd-green coalition was avoided .
the biggest victory for the greens during their time in the government was the agreement to phase out nuclear energy use in germany .
after the 2005 elections , the greens went back to being in the opposition .
in 2009 the party received its best election results yet , winning 10.7 percent of the vote .
since then their position in the opinion polls has continued to rise .
in some regions the greens have long beat out the spd in popularity and are seen as the main left-leaning party .
according to stroebele , in some parts of berlin the greens are more popular than any other party .

saturday , nov .
20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.11.2010 from radical opposition to mainstream party : the rise of the greens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens are today an influential party in german politics germany 's green party meets for its annual conference this weekend .
it originally set out to be the anti-party party .
now , 30 years later after the party was founded , they 're a force to be reckoned with . west germany was ripe for the founding of the green party in 1980 .
there had been a lack of a serious political opposition during the 1970s and many intellectuals found the political system of then-west germany to lean too far to the right .
at the same time , new social movements were bringing the environment , women 's issues , peace and civil rights into focus after having been largely ignored by the main parties .
the green party was going to reform the system from within .
" we 're switching to the greens .
the only alternative .
we 're voting for the greens . "
with this slightly awkward slogan , the greens began their first election campaign in 1980 .
shortly before , the party had been founded at a national level in karlsruhe .
the party had its roots in the environmental movement , the anti-nuclear movement and civil society .
other issues key to the early greens included questions about arms buildup and the nato double track decision , which allowed for the stationing of american missiles in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stroebele is still fighting for the greens ' causes 30 years later " there were serious problems in our society , " said hans-christian stroebele , a founding member of the greens and , at 74-years-old , the oldest member of parliament for the greens .
“ there was the threat of a nuclear-arms race and the destruction of the planet . ”
the new party was formed as a result of criticism of the party system itself .
the greens wanted to do everything differently from how the established parties did things .
they saw themselves as the anti-party party .
they wanted their own organization to be more democratic , pluralistic and transparent .
to achieve this they introduced a number of strict rules that were only slowly abandoned over the years through struggles from within the party .
for example , originally , elected members of parliament were meant to give up their seats after two years to another party member as part of a rotation system meant to enforce a strict separation between the power of office and the mandate from the people .
both genders and different factions of the party had to be equally represented .
even today the parliamentary group has two co-leaders , one of whom must be a woman .
the colorful oddballs enter parliament in the 1980 elections , however , the greens only won a disappointing 1.5 percent of the vote .
but when an early election was called in 1983 , they managed to get over the 5-percent hurdle to entering the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their long hair and casual clothing , the greens brought an irreverent attitude to politics while the elected members from the other parties met for a church service before the first session of the new parliament , the greens rolled a globe through the center of bonn , then the capital of west germany , and they carried flowers and branches into the bundestag .
with their casual clothing , beards and long hair , the greens brought a little color into the normally dignified gray of the chamber .
but it was n't the way the greens looked that was important , said stroebele .
" what was important were the new topics being addressed from the lectern . "
at first the other parties found it difficult to work with these newcomers to the bundestag .
only over time did they accept the greens and integrate them into the parliamentary process .
in 1990 , however , the greens suffered a setback .
after reunification , they did n't make it over that 5-percent hurdle .
only by joining up with the alliance 90 movement from the eastern german states were they able to secure their spot in the bundestag .
the rise of joschka fischer the early 1990s were a time of reorientation for the party .
internal disputes led several prominent left-leaning green politicians , known as the fundamentalists , to leave the party .
the so-called realists won out in the end with joschka fischer playing a significant role in determining the direction of the party at this time .
fischer had gotten government experience after his time as hessen 's environment minister beginning in 1985 .
in 1994 , he became of one the co-leaders of the greens ’ parliamentary group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an anti-authoritarian in his youth , fischer would lead the greens into government at a party conference in bremen in 1995 , fischer broke a green party taboo , arguing in favor of the german armed forces , the bundeswehr , taking part in foreign military missions .
the war in bosnia and the massacre of muslim men and boys in the un-protected zone of srbenica led fischer to move away from the traditionally staunch pacifism of the greens .
after the parliamentary election of 1998 , the greens joined the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in a coalition government and fischer became the country 's foreign minister .
in this new role he had to take some responsibility for germany 's participation in the kosovo war .
this change of course led to bitter arguments with the party base , which was n't ready to endorse the militarization of germany 's foreign policy .
at a special party conference in bielefeld in 1999 things got downright tumultuous , and fischer was hit in the head with a red paint bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer took a lot of flak for his support for germany sending troops to kosovo " this is a war , " the then foreign minister explained to his party at the conference .
" i never dreamed that this coalition of social democrats and greens would be at war .
but this war has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and that 's the point where the greens can no longer be considered a protest party . "
in the end , the party members gave fischer their support and a collapse of the spd-green coalition was avoided .
the biggest victory for the greens during their time in the government was the agreement to phase out nuclear energy use in germany .
after the 2005 elections , the greens went back to being in the opposition .
in 2009 the party received its best election results yet , winning 10.7 percent of the vote .
since then their position in the opinion polls has continued to rise .
in some regions the greens have long beat out the spd in popularity and are seen as the main left-leaning party .
according to stroebele , in some parts of berlin the greens are more popular than any other party .

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conflict stems from a 2006 eu directive that was overturned in germany earlier this year . as germany copes with new terror threats against the country this week , there have been renewed calls by some german politicians to restore germany 's 2007 data retention law , which was declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court earlier this year .
the law required telecommunications companies to store all e-mail , web traffic , landline and mobile data of each user for six months .
the idea is that through what is known as " data traffic analysis , " authorities can re-construct important information about a suspect given a pattern of phone conversations , text messages or e-mails .
even without the contents of the actual correspondence , law enforcement officials have said that knowing when or where a person made a mobile phone call can be crucial in an investigation .
the ruling relied largely on the argument that the law went against article 10 , paragraph 1 of the german basic law , which protects the secrecy of comunications and describes it as ironclad : " the private exchange of communications is protected against unauthorized interference . "
in the months that followed the march 2010 ruling overturning the law in germany , a political disagreement has broken out among various government ministers , most notably , justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who supports the ruling , and interior minister thomas de maiziere , who supports renewed data retention .
their debate has become yet another area of conflict between their respective parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the fdp , the main coalition partners in the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : law enforcement authorities around europe generally support stronger data retention laws government officials and law enforcement in many european countries , including sweden , have called for longer retention periods and said the saved communications data played important roles in solving serious crimes .
" it is a necessary and effective tool that makes it easier to uncover some crimes , " beatrice ask , sweden 's justice minister , told reporters in stockholm earlier this month .
however , there have been reports of abuse , which is precisely what internet and privacy advocates have warned against . in a report issued in july , the european data protection supervisor in brussels said telecom companies were saving and handing over data in ways that contradicted the directive and infringed on individuals ' privacy . " the data retention directive is a totally failed initiative , " joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative told deutsche welle .
" the european commission has had to postpone its report on its implementation repeatedly because it can not find evidence to justify its existence . " in response to questions from national governments and the european parliament , the european commission has agreed to reevaluate the directive .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : law enforcement authorities around europe generally support stronger data retention laws government officials and law enforcement in many european countries , including sweden , have called for longer retention periods and said the saved communications data played important roles in solving serious crimes .
" it is a necessary and effective tool that makes it easier to uncover some crimes , " beatrice ask , sweden 's justice minister , told reporters in stockholm earlier this month .
however , there have been reports of abuse , which is precisely what internet and privacy advocates have warned against . in a report issued in july , the european data protection supervisor in brussels said telecom companies were saving and handing over data in ways that contradicted the directive and infringed on individuals ' privacy . " the data retention directive is a totally failed initiative , " joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative told deutsche welle .
" the european commission has had to postpone its report on its implementation repeatedly because it can not find evidence to justify its existence . " in response to questions from national governments and the european parliament , the european commission has agreed to reevaluate the directive .

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

the conflict stems from a 2006 eu directive that was overturned in germany earlier this year . as germany copes with new terror threats against the country this week , there have been renewed calls by some german politicians to restore germany 's 2007 data retention law , which was declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court earlier this year .
the law required telecommunications companies to store all e-mail , web traffic , landline and mobile data of each user for six months .
the idea is that through what is known as " data traffic analysis , " authorities can re-construct important information about a suspect given a pattern of phone conversations , text messages or e-mails .
even without the contents of the actual correspondence , law enforcement officials have said that knowing when or where a person made a mobile phone call can be crucial in an investigation .
the ruling relied largely on the argument that the law went against article 10 , paragraph 1 of the german basic law , which protects the secrecy of comunications and describes it as ironclad : " the private exchange of communications is protected against unauthorized interference . "
in the months that followed the march 2010 ruling overturning the law in germany , a political disagreement has broken out among various government ministers , most notably , justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who supports the ruling , and interior minister thomas de maiziere , who supports renewed data retention .
their debate has become yet another area of conflict between their respective parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the fdp , the main coalition partners in the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : law enforcement authorities around europe generally support stronger data retention laws government officials and law enforcement in many european countries , including sweden , have called for longer retention periods and said the saved communications data played important roles in solving serious crimes .
" it is a necessary and effective tool that makes it easier to uncover some crimes , " beatrice ask , sweden 's justice minister , told reporters in stockholm earlier this month .
however , there have been reports of abuse , which is precisely what internet and privacy advocates have warned against . in a report issued in july , the european data protection supervisor in brussels said telecom companies were saving and handing over data in ways that contradicted the directive and infringed on individuals ' privacy . " the data retention directive is a totally failed initiative , " joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative told deutsche welle .
" the european commission has had to postpone its report on its implementation repeatedly because it can not find evidence to justify its existence . " in response to questions from national governments and the european parliament , the european commission has agreed to reevaluate the directive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 19.11.2010 germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland needs billions of euros to cover its huge debt a german government spokesman said ireland should be allowed to determine its own corporation tax rate , despite recent pressure from a senior finance expert in chancellor angela merkel 's party . government spokesman steffen seibert friday countered statements made earlier this week by michael meister , one of angela merkel 's senior financial advisers . asked whether germany wanted ireland to raise its corporate tax rate , seibert said this was a matter to be decided by the irish government .
meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .

it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

the hostage-takers said france must negotiate the release of hostages with osama bin laden directly . france on friday rejected demands from an al qaeda cell holding five french hostages in northern africa that it should negotiate their freedom with osama bin laden and pull its troops out of afghanistan .
" france can not accept that its policy be dictated by anyone outside , " new foreign minister michele alliot-marie said in a statement after abdelmalek droukdel , head of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- , made the demands in an audio recording on thursday .
the message listed demands to secure the release of five french hostages seized in niger in september along with a togolese and a madagascan .
the recording , broadcast by arab satellite network al jazeera , said that to ensure the hostages ' safety , france must " hasten and take -lsb- its -rsb- soldiers out of afghanistan according to a specific timetable that -lsb- france announces -rsb- officially . "
bin laden , in a recording aired by al jazeera in late october , also said france 's security would be compromised if it did not pull its 3,750 soldiers out of afghanistan .
he told france to treat the kidnapping as a warning and that a ban on the wearing of the burqa in public places in france justified violence against its citizens .
new reference to bin laden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostage-takers said france should negotiate with bin laden directly droukdel , alias abou moussaab abdelouadoud , also said that " any form of negotiations on this issue in the future will be done with no one other than our sheikh osama bin laden ... and according to his terms . "
former defense minister herve morin , who was closely following the hostage crisis until losing his portfolio during a reshuffle last week , said the reference to bin laden in thursday 's recording was new .
" withdrawing french troops from afghanistan is a kind of classic , traditional demand for all kinds of attacks , " he told france info radio .
" what 's new is the reference to bin laden .
generally , and particularly with aqim , it 's more of a franchise .
there is n't an al qaeda kind of holding company with a number of subsidiaries .
it 's not as structured as that . "
france said for the first time wednesday that it was in touch with the aqim kidnappers .
" of course there are all kinds of contact -lsb- with the hostage-takers -rsb- , new defense minister alain juppe told europe 1 radio , without giving more details .
" all the -lsb- french -rsb- authorities , the defense ministry , the foreign ministry , everyone is being extremely vigilant to make the necessary contact , " he said .
presumed safe asked if the hostages were believed to be safe , juppe added that there was " currently ... every reason to believe they are . "
the five french hostages were seized in niger in september along with a togolese and a madagascan and are believed to be held in neighboring mali .
the french hostages are an engineer working for nuclear giant areva and his wife , and several employees of a subcontractor .
president nicolas sarkozy on tuesday said he was " especially worried " about the hostages , but also said threats would not change french policy .

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking at a conference in frankfurt , germany , he said that " the best way to continue to deliver the strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of the dollar as well as support the global recovery , is through policies that lead to the resumption of robust growth . "
contentious policies the fed announced the bond-buyback program , a practice known as quantitative easing , on november 3 .
germany and france were quick to condemn the move , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble even called the policy " clueless " and " risky " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke 's monetary policy has drawn criticism at home and abroad " the policies of the us central bank exacerbate the insecurities in the global economy , " schaeuble told the news magazine der spiegel at the beginning of november .
economics minister rainer bruederle accused the fed of protectionist tendencies by " indirectly manipulating " the us dollar 's exchange rates with other major currencies .
the fear in europe is that another bout of quantitative easing in the us , which is designed to flood the markets with cheap money , will devalue the dollar against the euro .
germany , the world 's number two exporter , is especially concerned about the effect of a weak dollar on its exports .
quantitative easing is considered the last resort of monetary policy , when interest rates are zero or close to zero , with the economy stuck in a rut .
the idea is that the central bank buys back sovereign bonds and other government papers to allow banks , insurance companies and pension funds to use the money from the sale for loans to businesses for example .
critics like germany 's schaeuble point out that the excess liquidity caused by quantitative easing bears the risk of stoking inflation and causing another asset bubble .
some say the us is being hyprocritical by accusing china of keeping its currency artificially low against the us dollar , while at the same time weakening the dollar indirectly through its policies .
bernanke , however , said the policies are right in light of sluggish us growth , extremely low inflation and an unemployment rate stuck at a stubbornly high 10 percent .

the visit will most likely happen in september . arrangements for pope benedict xvi 's first official visit to his home country are under way , after the pontiff accepted the invitation of german president christian wulff .
the pope will travel to the archdioceses of berlin , freiburg and erfurt in late 2011 , according to a statement from the german episcopal conference .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the chairman of the conference , said the visit would be " an important moment in the life of our country . "
" i am firmly convinced that he will be a strong inspiration for many people , " zollitsch added .

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

leaders from the 13 nations with wild tigers are meeting amid claims that the animals could be extinct within a dozen years . leaders from 13 nations began meeting in russia on sunday to discuss the fate of the world 's 3,500 remaining wild tigers . it 's the first time that the heads of government of so many nations will meet to try to save one species . " this is an unprecedented gathering of world leaders -lsb- that aims -rsb- to double the number of tigers , " jim adams , vice president for the east asia and pacific region at the world bank , said at the opening ceremony . " the global tiger initiative is an example of balanced economic development with nature preservation . " hosted by russian prime minister , and self-proclaimed animal lover , vladimir putin , the four-day st. petersburg summit aims to double the number of tigers living in the wild by 2022 . that is the same year the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- has said tigers could become extinct if nothing was done to protect them . compared to the some 100,000 wild tigers estimated to have roamed the world about a century ago , decades of poaching and habitat destruction have left only about 3,500 tigers living in the wild , according wwf statistics . " three subspecies have already disappeared and none of the other six are secure , " according to a draft declaration due to be published at the summit . without drastic conservation measures , exhibits in zoos around the world could become the only places left to see these magnificent big cats .
it has been more than 20 years , for example , since a tiger has been spotted on the indonesian island of java . bildunterschrift : considerable preservation efforts are necessary to keep tigers from extinction russia 's lead russia is the only country to have seen its tiger population increase in recent years , from between 80 and 100 specimens in the 1960s to around 500 today . experts have hailed putin , who was famously photographed tranquilizing an amur tiger to be fitted with a tracking collar , for taking an active role in saving tigers . " russia can play here a leading role as a host and as a good example as its tiger population has actually grown , " sabri zain of traffic , which monitors the global trade in wild animals and plants , told the afp news agency . conservationists are convinced that hope remains . a us study identified 42 sites where aggressive and immediate intervention would save tiger populations , according to joe walston of the wildlife conservation society in new york . " these are the sites where not only are there breeding tigers , but they have potential to repopulate a larger landscape and have conservation infrastructure for us to be confident that these are places we can protect , " he told deutsche welle . methodical poachers despite consensus on the need to save the tiger , there is a stark lack of any coordination on the ground to stop illegal trade in tiger parts like whiskers , paws and bones that are prized in traditional asian medicine . successful conservation is always a multi-pronged effort , ranging from habitat protection to safe-guarding against inbreeding , walston said . but in the case of tigers , it is first and foremost about preventing the animals from being killed by poachers . " these are organized commercial poachers , who are parts of networks , ranging across nations to organize and target killing of tigers and other high commercially valuable species , " he said . " it 's for everything from somebody who wants a tiger head on wall or a rug on floor to people who think they will be a better performer in bed , to people who think it will cure them of certain diseases . " bildunterschrift : the russian summit represents a new level of international commitment to tigers political importance india and china - both among the 13 nations at the meeting that include bangladesh , bhutan , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , nepal , russia , thailand and vietnam - are regarded as the key players in saving the tiger . india is home to half of the world population , while the chinese remain the world 's biggest consumers of tiger products , despite global bans . walston said the four-day summit in russia represents an international commitment to tigers that could go a long way in their preservation . " this has the potential to be the most important meeting for a non-human species ever , " he said .
" it is a remarkable chance not only to put tigers on political map but for us to be able to identify where and how to put our combined efforts . " author .

british-born andrew jennings is expected to replace thomas fox at the start of 2011 . the karstadt board has agreed to appoint andrew jennings as the company 's new ceo , despite his relative inexperience with the german language , according to media reports .
the iconic department store chain was rescued from insolvency in september by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen .
berggruen recently announced that karstadt will collaborate with californian designer max azria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas berggruen got his way on the new appointment jennings will replace thomas fox , who was seen as a restructuring specialist brought in to put the ailing retail giant back on its feet .
a month ago , berggruen had reportedly agreed to extend fox 's contract to help karstadt complete its restructuring , but that plan appears to have changed .
retired and stuborn the appointment is considered a surprise , not least because the 62-year-old jennings departed from woolworth south africa at the beginning of the year and was officially in retirement .
previous to his retirement , he had held a number of positions in the retail industry , including general manager of the luxury british department store harrods .
reports say he has a reputation as an expert in turning around companies , and for personal stubbornness .
“ he is the most difficult man i 've ever had to deal with , ” the magazine quoted another former woolworth south africa executive , simon susman .
jennings was reportedly the personal first choice of bergruen himself , while board chairman alain caparros had favored someone with more direct experience of the german retail industry .

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

of the job cuts , 1,700 will be in germany .
the leverkusen-based producer aims to invest about half of the program 's savings in new drug and crop chemical research and in expansion in emerging countries , where it plans to create some 2,500 new jobs .
falling revenue , rising competition bayer is the latest big drug company to launch a restructuring program .
the move comes in response to falling revenue caused by generic drug competition , rising development costs and price pressure from health-care reforms imposed by indebted governments .
bundling existing resources and streamlining structures is " the only way , " said bayer chief executive marijn dekkers said in a statement , for the company to be able to continue investing in its expansion , particularly in asia , and to create new innovative products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer ceo marijn dekkers is prescribing some bitter medicine to his employees earlier in the week , swiss drug rivals roche holding and novartis launched their own cost-cutting programs , including sweeping job cuts to secure long-term profitability .
on wednesday , moody 's investors service reiterated a negative outlook on the pharmaceutical sector , citing looming patent expirations and government health-care reforms - all of which will impact drug makers ' profitability .
german government action just last week germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , approved rules to curb the power of pharmaceutical companies to set prices in the country , europe 's largest pharmaceutical market .
the reform , if approved later this month by the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , could cost the industry around 2 billion euros a year .
bayer , famous for its aspirin but also a producer of pesticides , plastics and pharmaceuticals , currently employs some 108,700 people worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 nato appears on course for new strategic concept nato -pipe- 19.11.2010 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato fears turkey is getting too close to iran turkey is a key player in nato plans to install a missile shield to defend against a nuclear threat from iran .
but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

the following responses come from the deutsche welle facebook page .
i see the problems with small business trying to gouge the customer and afraid to let go of the benefits they have obtained from their cozy support of politicians .
although small business gets a good press -lrb- partly because they make up the bulk of advertising -rrb- they often present as many challenges to consumers as the more criticized big business . - fergal yeah ... it really sucks that if i move to germany i will have to give up most of the things i enjoy eating ; things that are readily available in the us , like homemade burritos and even peanut butter -lrb- which my german friends love -rrb- .
it also really sucks that i sent a record player as a gift to my boyfriend and it cost me $ 90 -lrb- 66 euros -rrb- to ship it and then he had to pay 45 euros to get it out of customs or whatever once it got there !
so not cool !
i wish it was n't like this .
i 'd like to be able to share more with him if we have to live on opposite sides of the planet right now . - kadesh this situation has improved in the last few years - i can get nearly anything shipped from the uk or germany to poland now .
the biggest problems at this point are those artificial problems - products offered for sale elsewhere , like dvds with regional codes or certain smart phones that show up in some countries long before they show up in others .
retailers and their retailing associations are often their own worst enemies . - brad if you ship it as gift , personal items or any other description of the contents of your package it is not in any way considered commercial or merchandise .

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

speaking at a conference in frankfurt , germany , he said that " the best way to continue to deliver the strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of the dollar as well as support the global recovery , is through policies that lead to the resumption of robust growth . "
contentious policies the fed announced the bond-buyback program , a practice known as quantitative easing , on november 3 .
germany and france were quick to condemn the move , german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble even called the policy " clueless " and " risky " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke 's monetary policy has drawn criticism at home and abroad " the policies of the us central bank exacerbate the insecurities in the global economy , " schaeuble told the news magazine der spiegel at the beginning of november .
economics minister rainer bruederle accused the fed of protectionist tendencies by " indirectly manipulating " the us dollar 's exchange rates with other major currencies .
the fear in europe is that another bout of quantitative easing in the us , which is designed to flood the markets with cheap money , will devalue the dollar against the euro .
germany , the world 's number two exporter , is especially concerned about the effect of a weak dollar on its exports .
quantitative easing is considered the last resort of monetary policy , when interest rates are zero or close to zero , with the economy stuck in a rut .
the idea is that the central bank buys back sovereign bonds and other government papers to allow banks , insurance companies and pension funds to use the money from the sale for loans to businesses for example .
critics like germany 's schaeuble point out that the excess liquidity caused by quantitative easing bears the risk of stoking inflation and causing another asset bubble .
some say the us is being hyprocritical by accusing china of keeping its currency artificially low against the us dollar , while at the same time weakening the dollar indirectly through its policies .
bernanke , however , said the policies are right in light of sluggish us growth , extremely low inflation and an unemployment rate stuck at a stubbornly high 10 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 19.11.2010 germany denies pressuring ireland over business tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland needs billions of euros to cover its huge debt a german government spokesman said ireland should be allowed to determine its own corporation tax rate , despite recent pressure from a senior finance expert in chancellor angela merkel 's party . government spokesman steffen seibert friday countered statements made earlier this week by michael meister , one of angela merkel 's senior financial advisers . asked whether germany wanted ireland to raise its corporate tax rate , seibert said this was a matter to be decided by the irish government .
meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

leaders from the 13 nations with wild tigers are meeting amid claims that the animals could be extinct within a dozen years . leaders from 13 nations began meeting in russia on sunday to discuss the fate of the world 's 3,500 remaining wild tigers . it 's the first time that the heads of government of so many nations will meet to try to save one species . " this is an unprecedented gathering of world leaders -lsb- that aims -rsb- to double the number of tigers , " jim adams , vice president for the east asia and pacific region at the world bank , said at the opening ceremony . " the global tiger initiative is an example of balanced economic development with nature preservation . " hosted by russian prime minister , and self-proclaimed animal lover , vladimir putin , the four-day st. petersburg summit aims to double the number of tigers living in the wild by 2022 . that is the same year the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- has said tigers could become extinct if nothing was done to protect them . compared to the some 100,000 wild tigers estimated to have roamed the world about a century ago , decades of poaching and habitat destruction have left only about 3,500 tigers living in the wild , according wwf statistics . " three subspecies have already disappeared and none of the other six are secure , " according to a draft declaration due to be published at the summit . without drastic conservation measures , exhibits in zoos around the world could become the only places left to see these magnificent big cats .
it has been more than 20 years , for example , since a tiger has been spotted on the indonesian island of java . bildunterschrift : considerable preservation efforts are necessary to keep tigers from extinction russia 's lead russia is the only country to have seen its tiger population increase in recent years , from between 80 and 100 specimens in the 1960s to around 500 today . experts have hailed putin , who was famously photographed tranquilizing an amur tiger to be fitted with a tracking collar , for taking an active role in saving tigers . " russia can play here a leading role as a host and as a good example as its tiger population has actually grown , " sabri zain of traffic , which monitors the global trade in wild animals and plants , told the afp news agency . conservationists are convinced that hope remains . a us study identified 42 sites where aggressive and immediate intervention would save tiger populations , according to joe walston of the wildlife conservation society in new york . " these are the sites where not only are there breeding tigers , but they have potential to repopulate a larger landscape and have conservation infrastructure for us to be confident that these are places we can protect , " he told deutsche welle . methodical poachers despite consensus on the need to save the tiger , there is a stark lack of any coordination on the ground to stop illegal trade in tiger parts like whiskers , paws and bones that are prized in traditional asian medicine . successful conservation is always a multi-pronged effort , ranging from habitat protection to safe-guarding against inbreeding , walston said . but in the case of tigers , it is first and foremost about preventing the animals from being killed by poachers . " these are organized commercial poachers , who are parts of networks , ranging across nations to organize and target killing of tigers and other high commercially valuable species , " he said . " it 's for everything from somebody who wants a tiger head on wall or a rug on floor to people who think they will be a better performer in bed , to people who think it will cure them of certain diseases . " bildunterschrift : the russian summit represents a new level of international commitment to tigers political importance india and china - both among the 13 nations at the meeting that include bangladesh , bhutan , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , nepal , russia , thailand and vietnam - are regarded as the key players in saving the tiger . india is home to half of the world population , while the chinese remain the world 's biggest consumers of tiger products , despite global bans . walston said the four-day summit in russia represents an international commitment to tigers that could go a long way in their preservation . " this has the potential to be the most important meeting for a non-human species ever , " he said .
" it is a remarkable chance not only to put tigers on political map but for us to be able to identify where and how to put our combined efforts . " author .

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

new measures such as lower defense spending , pensions freezes and further cuts to government waste are meant to shrink the deficit by 5.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.9 billion -rrb- next year .
this would reduce the deficit to 16.8 billion euros -lrb- 7.4 percent of gdp -rrb- and bring it in line with the terms of the bailout deal .
sales tax will increase by 2 percent to 13 percent - after already being raised twice this year .
waste in the health sector will be specifically targeted .
athens said it would miss the targets for 2010 , blaming a deeper than expected recession and fiscal slippages .
however , it plans to catch up in 2011 .

feared union backlash in response to the budget , the public sector labor union said it would join private sector workers in a 24-hour general strike planned for december 15 .
" unprecedented austerity will hurt all civil servants and private sector workers , with no exception , " the head of the private sector union gsee , yannis panagopoulos , said in a statement .
under the 2011 budget , the government expects unemployment to rise to 14.6 percent from an estimated 12.1 percent this year .
the budget will be discussed in parliament and changes can be made before a final vote on december 22 .
the government has a comfortable majority and is expected to pass the budget easily .

a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

speaking at a conference in frankfurt , germany , he said that " the best way to continue to deliver the strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of the dollar as well as support the global recovery , is through policies that lead to the resumption of robust growth . "

the fear in europe is that another bout of quantitative easing in the us , which is designed to flood the markets with cheap money , will devalue the dollar against the euro .
germany , the world 's number two exporter , is especially concerned about the effect of a weak dollar on its exports .
quantitative easing is considered the last resort of monetary policy , when interest rates are zero or close to zero , with the economy stuck in a rut .
the idea is that the central bank buys back sovereign bonds and other government papers to allow banks , insurance companies and pension funds to use the money from the sale for loans to businesses for example .
critics like germany 's schaeuble point out that the excess liquidity caused by quantitative easing bears the risk of stoking inflation and causing another asset bubble .
some say the us is being hyprocritical by accusing china of keeping its currency artificially low against the us dollar , while at the same time weakening the dollar indirectly through its policies .
bernanke , however , said the policies are right in light of sluggish us growth , extremely low inflation and an unemployment rate stuck at a stubbornly high 10 percent .

but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

leaders from the 13 nations with wild tigers are meeting amid claims that the animals could be extinct within a dozen years . leaders from 13 nations began meeting in russia on sunday to discuss the fate of the world 's 3,500 remaining wild tigers . it 's the first time that the heads of government of so many nations will meet to try to save one species . " this is an unprecedented gathering of world leaders -lsb- that aims -rsb- to double the number of tigers , " jim adams , vice president for the east asia and pacific region at the world bank , said at the opening ceremony . " the global tiger initiative is an example of balanced economic development with nature preservation . " hosted by russian prime minister , and self-proclaimed animal lover , vladimir putin , the four-day st. petersburg summit aims to double the number of tigers living in the wild by 2022 . that is the same year the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- has said tigers could become extinct if nothing was done to protect them . compared to the some 100,000 wild tigers estimated to have roamed the world about a century ago , decades of poaching and habitat destruction have left only about 3,500 tigers living in the wild , according wwf statistics . " three subspecies have already disappeared and none of the other six are secure , " according to a draft declaration due to be published at the summit . without drastic conservation measures , exhibits in zoos around the world could become the only places left to see these magnificent big cats .
it has been more than 20 years , for example , since a tiger has been spotted on the indonesian island of java . bildunterschrift : considerable preservation efforts are necessary to keep tigers from extinction russia 's lead russia is the only country to have seen its tiger population increase in recent years , from between 80 and 100 specimens in the 1960s to around 500 today . experts have hailed putin , who was famously photographed tranquilizing an amur tiger to be fitted with a tracking collar , for taking an active role in saving tigers . " russia can play here a leading role as a host and as a good example as its tiger population has actually grown , " sabri zain of traffic , which monitors the global trade in wild animals and plants , told the afp news agency . conservationists are convinced that hope remains . a us study identified 42 sites where aggressive and immediate intervention would save tiger populations , according to joe walston of the wildlife conservation society in new york . " these are the sites where not only are there breeding tigers , but they have potential to repopulate a larger landscape and have conservation infrastructure for us to be confident that these are places we can protect , " he told deutsche welle . methodical poachers despite consensus on the need to save the tiger , there is a stark lack of any coordination on the ground to stop illegal trade in tiger parts like whiskers , paws and bones that are prized in traditional asian medicine . successful conservation is always a multi-pronged effort , ranging from habitat protection to safe-guarding against inbreeding , walston said . but in the case of tigers , it is first and foremost about preventing the animals from being killed by poachers . " these are organized commercial poachers , who are parts of networks , ranging across nations to organize and target killing of tigers and other high commercially valuable species , " he said . " it 's for everything from somebody who wants a tiger head on wall or a rug on floor to people who think they will be a better performer in bed , to people who think it will cure them of certain diseases . " bildunterschrift : the russian summit represents a new level of international commitment to tigers political importance india and china - both among the 13 nations at the meeting that include bangladesh , bhutan , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , nepal , russia , thailand and vietnam - are regarded as the key players in saving the tiger . india is home to half of the world population , while the chinese remain the world 's biggest consumers of tiger products , despite global bans . walston said the four-day summit in russia represents an international commitment to tigers that could go a long way in their preservation . " this has the potential to be the most important meeting for a non-human species ever , " he said .
" it is a remarkable chance not only to put tigers on political map but for us to be able to identify where and how to put our combined efforts . " author .

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .

" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 19.11.2010 russia convenes leaders ' summit to save tigers from extinction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild tigers are becoming harder and harder to find the fate of the world 's 3,500 wild tigers is the theme at a conference in russia this week .
leaders from the 13 nations with wild tigers are meeting amid claims that the animals could be extinct within a dozen years . leaders from 13 nations began meeting in russia on sunday to discuss the fate of the world 's 3,500 remaining wild tigers . it 's the first time that the heads of government of so many nations will meet to try to save one species . " this is an unprecedented gathering of world leaders -lsb- that aims -rsb- to double the number of tigers , " jim adams , vice president for the east asia and pacific region at the world bank , said at the opening ceremony . " the global tiger initiative is an example of balanced economic development with nature preservation . " hosted by russian prime minister , and self-proclaimed animal lover , vladimir putin , the four-day st. petersburg summit aims to double the number of tigers living in the wild by 2022 . that is the same year the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- has said tigers could become extinct if nothing was done to protect them . compared to the some 100,000 wild tigers estimated to have roamed the world about a century ago , decades of poaching and habitat destruction have left only about 3,500 tigers living in the wild , according wwf statistics . " three subspecies have already disappeared and none of the other six are secure , " according to a draft declaration due to be published at the summit . without drastic conservation measures , exhibits in zoos around the world could become the only places left to see these magnificent big cats .
it has been more than 20 years , for example , since a tiger has been spotted on the indonesian island of java . bildunterschrift : considerable preservation efforts are necessary to keep tigers from extinction russia 's lead russia is the only country to have seen its tiger population increase in recent years , from between 80 and 100 specimens in the 1960s to around 500 today . experts have hailed putin , who was famously photographed tranquilizing an amur tiger to be fitted with a tracking collar , for taking an active role in saving tigers . " russia can play here a leading role as a host and as a good example as its tiger population has actually grown , " sabri zain of traffic , which monitors the global trade in wild animals and plants , told the afp news agency . conservationists are convinced that hope remains . a us study identified 42 sites where aggressive and immediate intervention would save tiger populations , according to joe walston of the wildlife conservation society in new york . " these are the sites where not only are there breeding tigers , but they have potential to repopulate a larger landscape and have conservation infrastructure for us to be confident that these are places we can protect , " he told deutsche welle . methodical poachers despite consensus on the need to save the tiger , there is a stark lack of any coordination on the ground to stop illegal trade in tiger parts like whiskers , paws and bones that are prized in traditional asian medicine . successful conservation is always a multi-pronged effort , ranging from habitat protection to safe-guarding against inbreeding , walston said . but in the case of tigers , it is first and foremost about preventing the animals from being killed by poachers . " these are organized commercial poachers , who are parts of networks , ranging across nations to organize and target killing of tigers and other high commercially valuable species , " he said . " it 's for everything from somebody who wants a tiger head on wall or a rug on floor to people who think they will be a better performer in bed , to people who think it will cure them of certain diseases . " bildunterschrift : the russian summit represents a new level of international commitment to tigers political importance india and china - both among the 13 nations at the meeting that include bangladesh , bhutan , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , nepal , russia , thailand and vietnam - are regarded as the key players in saving the tiger . india is home to half of the world population , while the chinese remain the world 's biggest consumers of tiger products , despite global bans . walston said the four-day summit in russia represents an international commitment to tigers that could go a long way in their preservation . " this has the potential to be the most important meeting for a non-human species ever , " he said .
" it is a remarkable chance not only to put tigers on political map but for us to be able to identify where and how to put our combined efforts . " author .

the conflict stems from a 2006 eu directive that was overturned in germany earlier this year . as germany copes with new terror threats against the country this week , there have been renewed calls by some german politicians to restore germany 's 2007 data retention law , which was declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court earlier this year .
the law required telecommunications companies to store all e-mail , web traffic , landline and mobile data of each user for six months .
the idea is that through what is known as " data traffic analysis , " authorities can re-construct important information about a suspect given a pattern of phone conversations , text messages or e-mails .
even without the contents of the actual correspondence , law enforcement officials have said that knowing when or where a person made a mobile phone call can be crucial in an investigation .
the ruling relied largely on the argument that the law went against article 10 , paragraph 1 of the german basic law , which protects the secrecy of comunications and describes it as ironclad : " the private exchange of communications is protected against unauthorized interference . "
in the months that followed the march 2010 ruling overturning the law in germany , a political disagreement has broken out among various government ministers , most notably , justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who supports the ruling , and interior minister thomas de maiziere , who supports renewed data retention .
their debate has become yet another area of conflict between their respective parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the fdp , the main coalition partners in the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : law enforcement authorities around europe generally support stronger data retention laws government officials and law enforcement in many european countries , including sweden , have called for longer retention periods and said the saved communications data played important roles in solving serious crimes .
" it is a necessary and effective tool that makes it easier to uncover some crimes , " beatrice ask , sweden 's justice minister , told reporters in stockholm earlier this month .
however , there have been reports of abuse , which is precisely what internet and privacy advocates have warned against . in a report issued in july , the european data protection supervisor in brussels said telecom companies were saving and handing over data in ways that contradicted the directive and infringed on individuals ' privacy . " the data retention directive is a totally failed initiative , " joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative told deutsche welle .
" the european commission has had to postpone its report on its implementation repeatedly because it can not find evidence to justify its existence . " in response to questions from national governments and the european parliament , the european commission has agreed to reevaluate the directive .

the conflict stems from a 2006 eu directive that was overturned in germany earlier this year . as germany copes with new terror threats against the country this week , there have been renewed calls by some german politicians to restore germany 's 2007 data retention law , which was declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court earlier this year .
the law required telecommunications companies to store all e-mail , web traffic , landline and mobile data of each user for six months .
the idea is that through what is known as " data traffic analysis , " authorities can re-construct important information about a suspect given a pattern of phone conversations , text messages or e-mails .
even without the contents of the actual correspondence , law enforcement officials have said that knowing when or where a person made a mobile phone call can be crucial in an investigation .
the ruling relied largely on the argument that the law went against article 10 , paragraph 1 of the german basic law , which protects the secrecy of comunications and describes it as ironclad : " the private exchange of communications is protected against unauthorized interference . "
in the months that followed the march 2010 ruling overturning the law in germany , a political disagreement has broken out among various government ministers , most notably , justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who supports the ruling , and interior minister thomas de maiziere , who supports renewed data retention .
their debate has become yet another area of conflict between their respective parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the fdp , the main coalition partners in the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : law enforcement authorities around europe generally support stronger data retention laws government officials and law enforcement in many european countries , including sweden , have called for longer retention periods and said the saved communications data played important roles in solving serious crimes .
" it is a necessary and effective tool that makes it easier to uncover some crimes , " beatrice ask , sweden 's justice minister , told reporters in stockholm earlier this month .
however , there have been reports of abuse , which is precisely what internet and privacy advocates have warned against . in a report issued in july , the european data protection supervisor in brussels said telecom companies were saving and handing over data in ways that contradicted the directive and infringed on individuals ' privacy . " the data retention directive is a totally failed initiative , " joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative told deutsche welle .
" the european commission has had to postpone its report on its implementation repeatedly because it can not find evidence to justify its existence . " in response to questions from national governments and the european parliament , the european commission has agreed to reevaluate the directive .

investigations have begun to find out who bought and planted the case . a suspected bomb intercepted in namibia that was to be put on a munich-bound plane was only " a dummy " used to test security checks , the german interior minister said friday .
thomas de maiziere said it was a " so-called real test suitcase " made by a company in the united states that makes alarm and detection systems .
" these real test suitcases are built to test security measures , " de maiziere said .
at no time would the device have presented a danger to the passengers on the air berlin flight to munich , he added .

police chief matthias seeger was quoted in the daily bild newspaper as saying the danger of attack is greater than ever before .
" on a scale of one - no danger - to 10 - acute danger of attack - we are currently at 9 , " seeger said .
however , authorities have been quick to reassure the public that there is no cause for panic .
security at airports and railway stations has been tightened and experts have warned that traditional christmas markets across the country could be targeted .

can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
as the administration under george w. bush unilaterally waged its controversial " war on terror , " us policymakers worried that the military had become vulnerable to politically motivated indictments by the icc .
they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

the dw experts will go to any lengths to get you the match day predictions .
however , all this dabbling in the occult can be tiring so they 've taken a more peaceful approach for week 13 . this predicting lark may seem like a piece of cake to the untrained eye .
for the layman , it must seem that sitting around , plucking random scores form the ether while keeping one eye on the television is a moderately relaxing past-time .
considering how wrong we sometimes get it , it can also appear to be an exercise undertaken with a laissez-faire attitude from the comfort of a well-padded sofa .
in reality , it 's quite a stressful affair .
delving into various dark arts every week , communicating with malevolent soccer spirits in a variety of cod-supernatural rituals can have quite a taxing effect on a pundit - which is why we 've taken off to a cave with our yogi to try and forecast the results for match day thirteen from a state of spiritual nirvana .
altogether now : ommmmm ...
saturday , nov .
20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 nato appears on course for new strategic concept nato -pipe- 19.11.2010 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato fears turkey is getting too close to iran turkey is a key player in nato plans to install a missile shield to defend against a nuclear threat from iran .
but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

the dw experts will go to any lengths to get you the match day predictions .
however , all this dabbling in the occult can be tiring so they 've taken a more peaceful approach for week 13 . this predicting lark may seem like a piece of cake to the untrained eye .
for the layman , it must seem that sitting around , plucking random scores form the ether while keeping one eye on the television is a moderately relaxing past-time .
considering how wrong we sometimes get it , it can also appear to be an exercise undertaken with a laissez-faire attitude from the comfort of a well-padded sofa .
in reality , it 's quite a stressful affair .
delving into various dark arts every week , communicating with malevolent soccer spirits in a variety of cod-supernatural rituals can have quite a taxing effect on a pundit - which is why we 've taken off to a cave with our yogi to try and forecast the results for match day thirteen from a state of spiritual nirvana .
altogether now : ommmmm ...
saturday , nov .
20 schalke - bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santa will want to know if felix has been naughty or nice the report cards for these two read pretty much the same : both schalke and bremen are not reaching their full potential .
schalke 's problems are well documented - felix magath 's christmas list is rumored to include three points - while bremen have lost their mojo and may want santa to bring them a new one .
both scraped a point last week in drawn matches and this one could head the same way .
bremen used to believe in their maverick attacking but now they seem afraid to try , considering how unsure their defense is .
schalke have tried everything but still ca n't get it right .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt - hoffenheim frankfurt had a good chance of coming away from bremen with three points last week but left with only one , which suggests that they still do n't have the ruthless streak to put a crippled horse like werder out of its misery .
that cold heart may be needed against a hoffenheim side that are struggling to find the momentum they mislaid about a month ago .
losing to a fast-rising freiburg team will have stung .
the hoff may just have more of a killer instinct in this one .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 moenchengladbach - mainz from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again : gladbach went from putting six past leverkusen in the second weekend of the season to conceding eleven in their following two games .
now they 've finally swung back , scoring four against cologne , after a terrible spell .
mainz are in their own dip , slipping from first to third after a run of three straight defeats .
could it be that after over-achieving so early in the season , mainz are now heading towards their natural position as a mid-table team ?
they seemed too good to be just flattering to deceive .
the recovery starts here .
prediction : mainz 2-0 freiburg - dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cisse is on top form and is driving freiburg up the table freiburg have risen to fourth without anyone 's permission , thanks in part to the prolific form of striker pappis demba cissé .
the league 's second highest scorer has found his feet since joining from metz last year and his team mates seem to be inspired to reach his standards .
they 'll need the 10-goal striker to be clinical on saturday as dortmund will afford him few chances .
bvb have a solid defense to match the creative midfield and confident attack , making them as complete a package as the bundesliga has seen so far this season .
with the team on a roll , juergen klopp can look forward to another week on top after this one .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hanover - hamburg hamburg are the missing children of the bundesliga .
their squad photo should be circulated on the side of milk cartons .
this is a team that should be at least challenging for a top four slot , not heading into the black hole of mid-table obscurity .
one has to wonder where the real hsv has gone .
with no ideas and with their only direction a downward one , hamburg must find themselves before the winter break or face limping towards may with no target to aim for .
hanover stand a good chance of reaping the rewards of hamburg 's disappearance by notching a home win .
prediction : hanover 2-1 nuremberg - kaiserslautern in their last game , nuremberg were unlucky to face a bayern team smarting from louis van gaal 's hairdryer treatment following the lackluster show against gladbach two weeks ago .
the reaction was too strong for nuremberg .
whether such a defeat will have knocked the stuffing out of them remains to be seen .
kaiserslautern are unlikely to give nuremberg anywhere near the kind of lesson meted out by bayern last week so if they are looking to bounce back , this is the game to do it in .
kaiserslautern are struggling , despite surviving a 3-3 draw with stuttgart last week .
nuremberg should edge it .
prediction : nuremburg 1-0 leverkusen - bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon rolfes and co. have pushed leverkusen to second bayern looked ominous last week while putting three past nuremberg , but we have seen so many false dawns from them this season that it ’ s hard to know whether this is a bayern revival or just an anomaly .
leverkusen , meanwhile , have been one of the most consistent teams in the league this season , as reflected in their position .
the second-placed side will provide bayern with a tough task and will be a real test .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , nov .
21 stuttgart - cologne cologne had long threatened to plummet to the bottom and did so last week in some style , losing 4-0 at home to arch-rivals gladbach last week .
considering how bad their opponents have been for most of the season , this was the surest sign yet that cologne are in a mess and can probably start planning for relegation .
stuttgart have clawed their way out of their own relegation battle and are still making slow but steady progress .
while they have n't yet put a safe amount of daylight between them and the drop zone , they 're accumulating the necessary points to keep them from danger .
a further three should be garnered on sunday .
prediction : stuttgart 3-0 st. pauli - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these wolves are smiling but their position is precarious like two climbers tied together , hanging on an outcrop over a ravine , st. pauli and wolfsburg seem to be stuck dangling over the relegation abyss .
despite losing again last week , pauli remain static in 13th while the wolves managed a draw at home to schalke to keep their frost-bitten fingers on 12th .
only a point separates them .
should any of the teams in the three places below them win and either of these two loses this match , the slide into the relegation zone will take a dramatic lurch .
wolfsburg seem to be the team with the better tools to drag themselves away .
and pauli ?
they appear to be losing their grip .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 last week 's results : 5 points dortmund - hamburg 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction 2-0 -rrb- bremen - frankfurt 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- wolfsburg - schalke 2-2 -lrb- dw prediction 3-2 -rrb- cologne - moechengladbach 0-4 -lrb- dw prediction 0-1 -rrb- kaiserslautern - stuttgart 3-3 -lrb- dw prediction 2-2 -rrb- st. pauli - leverkusen 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-3 -rrb- mainz - hannover 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction 2-0 -rrb- hoffenheim - freiburg 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-0 -rrb- bayern - nuremberg 3-0 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- total for the season : 54 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the visit will most likely happen in september . arrangements for pope benedict xvi 's first official visit to his home country are under way , after the pontiff accepted the invitation of german president christian wulff .
the pope will travel to the archdioceses of berlin , freiburg and erfurt in late 2011 , according to a statement from the german episcopal conference .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the chairman of the conference , said the visit would be " an important moment in the life of our country . "
" i am firmly convinced that he will be a strong inspiration for many people , " zollitsch added .
first official visit the planned visit will be benedict 's first official trip to germany , although he made appearances in cologne while it was hosting world youth day in 2005 and in his native bavaria in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people are expected to pay tribute during a state visit the invitation was extended by christian wulff in october .
" it is a particularly special pleasure and honor for me and many people in our country to welcome the holy father to his home country in the 60th anniversary year of his ordination to the priesthood , " wulff said .
the election of then cardinal joseph ratzinger in april 2005 to succeed the late pope john paul ii was a source of great pride in germany - which is about 30 percent catholic .
the last official papal visit to germany was by pope john paul ii in 1996 . sexual abuse victims still waiting the pontiff is likely to receive a cooler reception from german victims of sexual abuse by priests of the roman catholic church . not much has been done after zollitsch announced in september that the church was preparing compensation payments for abuse victims . the german church has admitted it had failed to properly investigate claims of abuse , simply moving pedophile priests to another diocese instead of reporting them to the police .
the pope himself has faced allegations that he , as cardinal joseph ratzinger , failed to act against molesting priests while he was heading the vatican morals watchdog . author : catherine bolsover , sarah steffen -lrb- afp , ap , epd -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .
washington is eager to see if germany adopts a european policy line or decides to go out on its own in some areas , especially when it comes to finance .
" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .
" the europeans do n't want to see a reversal to a more conservative , bush-type foreign policy , " he said .

in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

a genuine partnership must develop in the long term , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . at the summit in lisbon on november 19 and 20 , nato intends to adopt a new strategy and also improve its relations with russia .
this is not the first time since the end of the cold war that nato and russia have drawn closer .
there is no guarantee of success this time , but the prospects are not bad . relations between russia and the major continental european countries have improved over the years , and us president barack obama 's " reset " policy towards russia has produced its first positive results in the new start arms reduction treaty , or russia 's refusal to sell s-300 air defense missiles to iran .
security risks in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian department on all sides , the realization has grown that europe 's security framework has dangerous weaknesses .
the russo-georgian war in august 2008 clearly showed what happens when " frozen conflicts " are reignited .
and there are still two such conflicts in europe , in transnistria and nagorno-karabakh .
in addition , it must be remembered that russia is still feared in the east , central european and baltic states .
having said that , the prospect of nato forming closer relations with the former soviet republic evokes a feeling of vulnerability and encirclement .
the core of the problem is that since the cold war , a stable security order in europe has not emerged which gives sufficient consideration to the interests of all states - and that undoubtedly includes russia .
the goal must therefore be to link russia more closely with the existing european and transatlantic structures .
enormous stumbling blocks an important step towards a partnership and stronger mutual trust could be a joint missile defense system .
based on a common threat assessment this defense system would not only protect europe from a nuclear-armed iran , but also russia .
agreeing on a missile defense system is n't the only obstacle on a path to partnership .
the possibility of the us senate not ratifying the new start agreement or the russian-iran policy are also important stumbling blocks .
what the political construction of a nato-russia partnership could look like is not only open - possibilities are a new treaty , a new charter , or even in the distant future , russia 's accession to nato - but is also of secondary importance .
for both sides , this development would not be an easy step in any case .
it would produce opponents both in nato countries and russia : some would - quite rightly - point to the significant democratic deficits in russia today .
others would , in slavophile tradition , fear the loss of russian national independence .
but what would be the alternative to a partnership - the continuation of the latent and anachronistic rivalry between nato and russia , while the world has long since moved on ?

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

" we face new threats and challenges and this strategic concept will ensure nato remains as effective as ever in defending our peace and security ...
it also modernizes the way nato does defense in the 21st century , " he said .
the document - the details of which were not immediately clear - is to recommit nato to defending any of its members that comes under attack .
the new concept is meant to make nato more " effective , engaged and efficient , " nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen said as he opened the summit amidst heavy rain in lisbon .
missile defense shield us president barack obama said after friday 's meetings in lisbon had come to a close that nato leaders had agreed to set up a new anti-missile defence shield across europe and to invite russia to take part . " i 'm pleased to announce that for the first time , we have agreed to develop a missile defence capability that 's strong enough to cover all nato european territory and populations , as well as the united states , " obama said .
rasmussen had announced earlier that the defense shield would be a major part of nato 's new strategy , stressing that nato needed to take the threat of ballistic missile attacks more seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders see saturday as a potential turn of the tide " i expect that the summit will agree that nato develop the capability to defend europe against missile attacks .
there is a clear threat .
the capabilities to defend against those attacks exist and we can afford it , " rasmussen said .
rasmussen also made a point of extending nato 's invitation to moscow to join the talks on the creation of the missile-defense system .
" by reaching out and inviting russia to cooperate with us , i believe we have a real chance to build a security roof for the entire euro-atlantic area , " rasmussen said , adding that he wanted to reassure that the missile screen was not meant to block attacks from russia .
german chancellor angela merkel said russia 's participation in the talks could mean a new phase of cooperation between the two former archenemies , saying before she took off for lisbon that she wished for russia " to be as involved as possible . "
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , is due to join the summit on saturday and is widely expected to agree to such talks .
withdrawal from afghanistan also on saturday , afghan president hamid karzai will arrive in lisbon for talks on the withdrawal of nato forces from afghanistan , which is planned to begin mid-2011 .
nato leaders will formally announce the exit strategy at the summit , hoping to bring an end to the war viewed as highly unsuccessful for the united states and its allies .
over 2,000 foreign troops have been killed since the isaf mission began in late 2001 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato is set to announce 2014 as its pull-out goal the leaders are expected to resolve upon conferring responsibility for the security of the country onto afghan forces currently being trained by nato forces .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , who arrived in lisbon early on friday , said washington " recognized and respected the sovereignty of the afghan people " and that the obama administration was working " closely together " with the government to ensure a timely transition of security .
" we will agree on the beginning of a transition to afghan security starting next year with the intention and goal of turning over afghan security to the government and people of afghanistan in 2014 , " clinton told reporters in lisbon , adding , that there would be " continued commitment of civilian support .

meister , a deputy leader in parliament and a finance expert for merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said tuesday ireland needed to consider raising the levy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister brian cowen has vowed to raise the corporate tax " the irish rates are below the european union average , " meister told news agency reuters on the sidelines of the cdu 's annual party congress .
" i therefore see here at least a possibility , given the high -lrb- irish -rrb- budget deficit , to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth . "
but at a general press briefing on friday , seibert said : " the german government greatly supports the irish government 's policies and has great confidence in the courageous reform policies contained in the four-year program it is expected to present in early december . "
bite the bullet dublin 's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , one of the lowest in the 27-nation eu , has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like google and pfizer to ireland .
in the past few years , several international companies have relocated from other european countries to ireland .
up until the financial crisis , ireland had been able to maintain a fairly stable fiscal budget , even with its low corporate tax rate .
but irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks , and the country is now under pressure to ask the eu for financial assistance to help cope with its fragile banks .
the irish banking sector is estimated to have up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering this amount themselves .
now there is pressure in europe to make raising corporate tax a condition of a proposed bailout funded by the eu and international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish banking sector has huge debts benedikt zinn , researcher for the mannheim-based center for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- , said ireland 's corporate tax rate is unique in western europe .
" ireland has a corporate tax of 12.5 percent , while for example germany - if you take together corporate tax , trade tax and so on - you 'll end up with 30 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
" many politicians have said this has kick-started an international tax competition based on companies practically being subsidized by tax breaks .
this has profitably brought many companies to ireland that do n't necessarily have substance . "
unfair advantage ireland is now being chided by many european countries that feel unfairly disadvantaged by its tax policy .
some eu leaders believe ireland should have taken a more moderate economic approach .
zinn is unsure whether raising corporate tax at the moment is a good idea .
" now with profits down , of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" i 'm not sure this would be a wise step .
at the moment , raising the tax would probably be damaging because then of course new investment would not materialize . "
a 2008 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that on average , a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment .
german critics meister 's comments come one day after elmar brok , a senior cdu lawmaker and a member of the european parliament since 1980 , said ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate .
" ireland has two options to consolidate its budget - cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate , " brok said at the cdu conference .
ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals .
" one should n't forget that direct taxes are a national concern ; the eu has basically no influence on it , " said zinn .
" i would n't call it a threat to this national freedom , but if there is eu pressure , then it 's certainly a way of influencing direct tax policy through the back door . "

the hot , gaseous planet was pulled into the earth 's galaxy in an act of " galactic cannibalism . " slightly larger than the size of jupiter , the largest in our solar system , the newly discovered exoplanet is orbiting a star 2,000 light years from earth that has found its way into the milky way . the pair of bodies is believed to be part of the helmi stream , a group of stars that remains after its mini-galaxy was devoured by the milky way some six to nine billion years ago , said the study , published thursday in the journal science express . the planet and star are thought to have originally belonged to a dwarf galaxy that was devoured by the milky way in what the astronomers called " an act of galactic cannibalism . " first-time discovery " as far as i know this is the first time a planet like this has been discovered , " said johny setiawan at the max planck institute for astronomy in heidelberg , in an interview with reuters .
" it came to our galaxy about six to nine billion years ago , " astronomers located the planet , named hip 13044 b , by focusing on the " tiny telltale wobbles of the star caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting companion , " the study said . they found the planet and star by using a high-resolution spectrograph attached to a 2.2-meter telescope -lrb- 7.2-foot -rrb- at the european southern laboratory at la silla observatory in chile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setiawan said he 'll continue looking for planets outside the milky way " this discovery is very exciting , " said rainer klement , also of the max planck institute for astronomy , in a statement .
" because of the great distances involved , there are no confirmed detections of planets in other galaxies .
but this cosmic merger has brought an extragalactic planet within our reach . " a view of earth 's fate ? scientists said the planet could offer a look at the future of the earth 's planetary system as it survived the " red giant " stage of stellar evolution in which the host star grew massively after depleting its core hydrogen fuel supply . " this discovery is particularly intriguing when we consider the distant future of our own planetary system , as the sun is also expected to become a red giant in about five billion years , " added setiawan in the same statement . the exoplanet is likely to be quite hot because it is orbiting so close to its star , completing each orbit in just over 16 days , and is probably near the end of its life , astronomers said . astronomers were mystified as to how the planet might have formed , since the star contained few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and planets typically form out of a complex cloud of spinning space rubble . the astronomers said it would be impossible to draw any certain conclusions about the planet 's formation from the single data point , adding that they would continue trying to find more planets orbiting late-type stars . " it is a puzzle for the widely accepted model of planet formation to explain how such a star , which contains hardly any heavy elements at all , could have formed a planet , " setiawan noted . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 nato appears on course for new strategic concept nato -pipe- 19.11.2010 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato fears turkey is getting too close to iran turkey is a key player in nato plans to install a missile shield to defend against a nuclear threat from iran .
but as the alliance 's summit begins on friday , turkish support for the plan remains uncertain . leaders of the 28 nato member countries begin a two-day summit in lisbon on friday , and next to the war in afghanistan , a missile defense shield to defend against iran is set to be high on the agenda .
turkey is seen as playing a key role in the program , but ankara is far from enthusiastic .
this week turkish president abdullah gul said he wrote to nato leaders explaining his country 's concerns over the proposed missile defense shield .
primarily , ankara fears potential fallout with iran , with which in the last few years it has rapidly developed strong political and economic ties .
political scientist cengiz aktar of bahcesehir university said the missile defense program is now viewed by turkey 's western allies as a test of its allegiances .
" turkey has been challenged by the us and the alliance , because recently the turkish government has developed warm relations with iran , " he said .
" now turkey has to prove whether it is still an actor and player within the alliance . "
' no ' vote on sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's geographic proximity to iran makes it a key player in the missile defense shield turkey 's closeness with iran was epitomized in july , when ankara voted against a un security council resolution to impose new sanctions on iran for its continued uranium enrichment program .
the vote set alarm bells ringing in the capitals of ankara 's western allies - none more so than in washington .
concern had already been growing in the us even before the vote , following the collapse of relations between turkey and israel .
now washington is using all its diplomatic muscle on ankara to secure its participation in the missile defense program .
turkey is the only nato country bordering iran , and is thus seen as playing a key role in the program .
earlier this month the head of the us senate committee on foreign relations , john kerry , visited turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan to press washington 's case .
even though he put a positive spin on the talks , he admitted little progress had been made .
" by the time we get to lisbon i am very confident that we 're all going to be on the same page and be able to move ahead very constructively , " kerry said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense shield is meant to protect from a threat from iran eu criticism analysts say the failure to resolve the issue before the lisbon summit is causing concern in both washington and europe .
in the european union 's annual progress report published this month , it too stressed its concern with turkey 's apparent reluctance to tow the eu 's foreign policy line .
but prime minister erdogan seemed undaunted by the criticism and appeared to harden his position , making new demands on nato .
" there is the issue of who will be given control of the -lsb- missile defense -rsb- system , " erdogan said .
" if it is thought to be on our territory , then it should be definitely handed to us .
otherwise it is not possible for us to accept such a deal . "
tensions with nato such a demand could prove hard for nato to agree to , especially with increasing questions about turkey 's relations with iran .
the lisbon summit is expected to see hours of tough negotiations , with no guarantee of success , and aktar said turkey is more than capable of walking away from the negotiation table .
" of course turkey can say no .
they have said no already in the un security council , " he said .
" that wo n't impede the alliance to go ahead and install the missile shield elsewhere .
but it will create tremendous tensions with the remaining 27 members of the alliance , not to mention israel . "
even if nato agrees on a compromise , as is expected , turkey 's apparent reticence will not go unnoticed .
failure to reach an agreement would likely be a turning point in turkey 's relations with the west .

the conflict stems from a 2006 eu directive that was overturned in germany earlier this year . as germany copes with new terror threats against the country this week , there have been renewed calls by some german politicians to restore germany 's 2007 data retention law , which was declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court earlier this year .
the law required telecommunications companies to store all e-mail , web traffic , landline and mobile data of each user for six months .
the idea is that through what is known as " data traffic analysis , " authorities can re-construct important information about a suspect given a pattern of phone conversations , text messages or e-mails .
even without the contents of the actual correspondence , law enforcement officials have said that knowing when or where a person made a mobile phone call can be crucial in an investigation .
the ruling relied largely on the argument that the law went against article 10 , paragraph 1 of the german basic law , which protects the secrecy of comunications and describes it as ironclad : " the private exchange of communications is protected against unauthorized interference . "
in the months that followed the march 2010 ruling overturning the law in germany , a political disagreement has broken out among various government ministers , most notably , justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who supports the ruling , and interior minister thomas de maiziere , who supports renewed data retention .
their debate has become yet another area of conflict between their respective parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the fdp , the main coalition partners in the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : law enforcement authorities around europe generally support stronger data retention laws government officials and law enforcement in many european countries , including sweden , have called for longer retention periods and said the saved communications data played important roles in solving serious crimes .
" it is a necessary and effective tool that makes it easier to uncover some crimes , " beatrice ask , sweden 's justice minister , told reporters in stockholm earlier this month .
however , there have been reports of abuse , which is precisely what internet and privacy advocates have warned against . in a report issued in july , the european data protection supervisor in brussels said telecom companies were saving and handing over data in ways that contradicted the directive and infringed on individuals ' privacy . " the data retention directive is a totally failed initiative , " joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative told deutsche welle .
" the european commission has had to postpone its report on its implementation repeatedly because it can not find evidence to justify its existence . " in response to questions from national governments and the european parliament , the european commission has agreed to reevaluate the directive .

the conflict stems from a 2006 eu directive that was overturned in germany earlier this year . as germany copes with new terror threats against the country this week , there have been renewed calls by some german politicians to restore germany 's 2007 data retention law , which was declared unconstitutional by the federal constitutional court earlier this year .
the law required telecommunications companies to store all e-mail , web traffic , landline and mobile data of each user for six months .
the idea is that through what is known as " data traffic analysis , " authorities can re-construct important information about a suspect given a pattern of phone conversations , text messages or e-mails .
even without the contents of the actual correspondence , law enforcement officials have said that knowing when or where a person made a mobile phone call can be crucial in an investigation .
the ruling relied largely on the argument that the law went against article 10 , paragraph 1 of the german basic law , which protects the secrecy of comunications and describes it as ironclad : " the private exchange of communications is protected against unauthorized interference . "
in the months that followed the march 2010 ruling overturning the law in germany , a political disagreement has broken out among various government ministers , most notably , justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who supports the ruling , and interior minister thomas de maiziere , who supports renewed data retention .
their debate has become yet another area of conflict between their respective parties , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the fdp , the main coalition partners in the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberg has begun work on a compromise in an interview friday with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , minister leutheusser-schnarrenberg said her office was against the resumption of data retention and has begun work on proposing support for " event-related use of any data , " whereby such data could be temporarily captured and handed over to authorities , as is the case in the united states .
meanwhile , the head of the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national cdu , has come out strongly in favor of a new data retention policy that would , in essence , restore the old law .
" -lsb- the new policy -rsb- must provide security forces with the means to provide technical and legal means so that they can fight against organized crime , " said hans-peter friedrich , in an interview this week with the german television network zdf .
dispute results from a 2006 eu directive the data retention law was a consequence of the 2006 european union directive ordering member states to store telephone , e-mail and internet usage data , as well as the location of mobile phones for at least six months .
while most eu member states have implemented the directive , german and romaninan courts have declared their national laws to be unconstitutional .
earlier this month , sweden 's parliament presented a bill that would bring sweden in line with directive 2006/24 / ec , as it is formally known .

it 's hoped the talks will calm european fears that the us has lost interest in the relationship . these days , it seems that german chancellor angela merkel has more in common with chinese president hu jintao than with the us president when it comes to american suggestions about capping exports .
it 's another sign of a trans-atlantic relationship that has lost steam along the way .
but on both sides of the big pond , there are hopes that this weekend 's speed summit – expected to last about two hours – can reinvigorate ties .
the decision to meet on the tail end of the nato summit came after washington said obama would not be attending a may summit in madrid .
that led to fears that the us has turned its gaze elsewhere , particularly toward asia , and is no longer all that interested in its long-term allies in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and merkel have not seen eye to eye lately on several issues " the trans-atlantic relationship is not living up to its potential .
i think we should do much more together , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in july .
that has been a cause for criticism , especially in conservative circles in washington .
" president obama really does n't seem to have that link , " said sally mcnamara from the conservative heritage foundation .
" he seems to look out at the world and if you 're ranking them , he would probably rank the pacific number 1 , the middle east number 2 and europe really comes in a distant third . "
still close but the us government insists that europe is still high on its priority list , saying that both sides of the atlantic are on the same page on critical matters such as iran , afghanistan and the middle east in general .
" when you look at the agenda we face today , i think there really is a remarkable degree of allied unity , " said phil gordon , deputy press spokesperson for the us state department , adding that america 's interest in asia and the middle east does not have to put a strain on ties between europe and the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso has expressed frustration with the state of trans-atlantic ties in lisbon , obama will meet with both of the eu 's top officials – herman van rompuy , president of the european council , and barroso .
the leaders are expected to focus on economic cooperation , including the current financial crisis in ireland , security issues and cooperation on other global issues , such as international development .
but there are policy divides that are not likely to be bridged in a two-hour summit .
european governments have been critical of washington 's decision to pump $ 600 billion -lrb- 437 billion euros -rrb- into the us economy and europe 's austerity plans stand in sharp relief to obama 's philosophy of economic recovery through increased government spending .
trade issues are a concern , as is the approach to climate change in the lead up to international climate talks in cancun .
economy and security but economic ties between the us and europe remain strong .
according to the white house office on european cooperation , four trillion dollars flow between the united states and europe in trade and investment every year and approximately one in ten us jobs are created every year from the trans-atlantic economic relationship " so it is central to all of us , " said liz sherwood-randall , the office 's director .
it is hoped that lisbon can breathe new life into the trans-atlantic economic council , or tec , which was set up in 2007 to direct economic co-operation between the two economies .
on the security front , the recent case of the parcel bombs from yemen en route to the united states , which were discovered in the uk , as well as the recently stepped-up terror warnings in germany show how important trans-atlantic relations are in an era of global terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the us seems more interested in asia than its european allies while the eu will be trying to read the tea leaves regarding us attitudes , the americans will be sizing up europe , and germany in particular .

" i think it 's important for the europeans to tell the united states that this is not the case and that germany remains very much a committed european country , " said steven szabo from the german marshall fund in washington , dc .
the important thing , he says , is that the meeting is actually taking place .
the us is aware of european accusations of waning interest .
" it 's an easy , two-hour symbolic move for the administration to say ' we still care , " ' he said .
he added the europeans also need to communicate that they are behind the overall direction of american foreign policy , especially after the setbacks the administration suffered in the recent mid-term elections , which put the us house of representatives in republican hands .

dw 's gavin blackburn and the rest of the city certainly do n't think so . karaoke has been around for a long time and , for many , does n't figure too highly on the list of credible pastimes .
the craze for singing badly to your favorite pop songs started in japan , spread throughout europe in the early 1990s and has been pretty much a drunken joke ever since . in the uk , where i come from , karaoke was one of those things you always went to but never participated in .
some balding , middle-aged , former cruise ship entertainer would set up his tv screen and piffling speakers and stumble through a couple of tom jones numbers until the tipsy housewives were brave enough to teeter to the stage and warble their way through " i will survive . "
woeful in the extreme . however , in the last year or so , berliners have rediscovered and reinvented karaoke to the extent that it is rapidly gaining legendary status as a credible and fun way to spend an evening .
while its popularity may surprise many , given the city 's reputation for being three-quarters full with po-faced hipsters who try to out-bore each other at parties , it 's not all that much of a shock to me .
i have seen the cool facade before . every now and again , the real personality of berliners flashes through . the fall of the cool facade i recall being at a see-and-be-seen party a couple of years back where all those who were n't making some token effort to vaguely sway to the monotonous pseudo-techno music , were standing around the fringes like mourners at a state funeral . the dj decided , for reasons unknown even to eminent scientists , to play " i 've had the time of my life " from " dirty dancing . "
it was as if the entire club had received a massive electric shock .
the zombified clubbers on the dance floor suddenly sprang to life , while those morose shop-window dummies around the edges leapt onto the dance floor like someone had just whacked them on the bottom with a spade .
i myself stood nodding sagely in the corner , safe in the knowledge that berliners are n't really as cool as they would have us all think . therefore karaoke 's success here is scarcely surprising .
in the summer months , locals amass in prenzlauer berg 's mauerpark in their thousands to take part in the daytime open-air karaoke , which has now taken on stadium-like proportions .
dedicated karaoke bars - bars which run regular karaoke nights - are springing up in numbers which could even rival the dog piles on the city 's streets . bildunterschrift : fancy yourself as the next tokio hotel ?
at a karaoke bar , you can be your favorite star - at least for a night the moment of conversion " come on , it 'll be fun .
it 's like being a pop star for a night ! " enthused a pal of mine , eagerly trying to convince me to join her at one of berlin 's most popular karaoke hang-outs , monster ronsons .
it was sunday night and at this time , as an alternative to hiring a private karaoke cabin , you can also sing on stage .
so , i went along not expecting very much and came away a 100-percent karaoke convert . the only song i know i can sing reasonably well is " mack the knife " by bobby darin and , figuring that if i were to go on the stage at all , i might as well not make a spectacle of myself . " given that you 're wearing a sailor shirt and knickerbockers , some might argue it 's already too late for that , " quipped my friend shortly before mysteriously acquiring something vaguely resembling a black eye . finally , after about 14 bracing beers and what seemed like an eternity , my name was called and away i went .
standing there under the spotlights , clicking my fingers and occasionally swinging my hips , i might well have been in the rat pack .
i did n't need the lyrics ; the stage - and the song - were all mine . as i hit the big finish high note at the end of the song , to say the applause was rapturous would have been an understatement .

dw 's gavin blackburn and the rest of the city certainly do n't think so . karaoke has been around for a long time and , for many , does n't figure too highly on the list of credible pastimes .
the craze for singing badly to your favorite pop songs started in japan , spread throughout europe in the early 1990s and has been pretty much a drunken joke ever since . in the uk , where i come from , karaoke was one of those things you always went to but never participated in .
some balding , middle-aged , former cruise ship entertainer would set up his tv screen and piffling speakers and stumble through a couple of tom jones numbers until the tipsy housewives were brave enough to teeter to the stage and warble their way through " i will survive . "
woeful in the extreme . however , in the last year or so , berliners have rediscovered and reinvented karaoke to the extent that it is rapidly gaining legendary status as a credible and fun way to spend an evening .
while its popularity may surprise many , given the city 's reputation for being three-quarters full with po-faced hipsters who try to out-bore each other at parties , it 's not all that much of a shock to me .
i have seen the cool facade before . every now and again , the real personality of berliners flashes through . the fall of the cool facade i recall being at a see-and-be-seen party a couple of years back where all those who were n't making some token effort to vaguely sway to the monotonous pseudo-techno music , were standing around the fringes like mourners at a state funeral . the dj decided , for reasons unknown even to eminent scientists , to play " i 've had the time of my life " from " dirty dancing . "
it was as if the entire club had received a massive electric shock .
the zombified clubbers on the dance floor suddenly sprang to life , while those morose shop-window dummies around the edges leapt onto the dance floor like someone had just whacked them on the bottom with a spade .
i myself stood nodding sagely in the corner , safe in the knowledge that berliners are n't really as cool as they would have us all think . therefore karaoke 's success here is scarcely surprising .
in the summer months , locals amass in prenzlauer berg 's mauerpark in their thousands to take part in the daytime open-air karaoke , which has now taken on stadium-like proportions .
dedicated karaoke bars - bars which run regular karaoke nights - are springing up in numbers which could even rival the dog piles on the city 's streets . bildunterschrift : fancy yourself as the next tokio hotel ?
at a karaoke bar , you can be your favorite star - at least for a night the moment of conversion " come on , it 'll be fun .
it 's like being a pop star for a night ! " enthused a pal of mine , eagerly trying to convince me to join her at one of berlin 's most popular karaoke hang-outs , monster ronsons .
it was sunday night and at this time , as an alternative to hiring a private karaoke cabin , you can also sing on stage .
so , i went along not expecting very much and came away a 100-percent karaoke convert . the only song i know i can sing reasonably well is " mack the knife " by bobby darin and , figuring that if i were to go on the stage at all , i might as well not make a spectacle of myself . " given that you 're wearing a sailor shirt and knickerbockers , some might argue it 's already too late for that , " quipped my friend shortly before mysteriously acquiring something vaguely resembling a black eye . finally , after about 14 bracing beers and what seemed like an eternity , my name was called and away i went .
standing there under the spotlights , clicking my fingers and occasionally swinging my hips , i might well have been in the rat pack .
i did n't need the lyrics ; the stage - and the song - were all mine . as i hit the big finish high note at the end of the song , to say the applause was rapturous would have been an understatement .
i never heard such whooping and cheering for anything i 'd done since the day i threw a tennis ball at mrs. murphy in seventh grade french class . the berlin touch and this is where karaoke differs in berlin : whether you can sing or barely croak through your song of choice , the assembled audience will clap and cheer and dance along to your efforts , so even those with the most miserable of singing voices need n't feel embarrassed to have a go . it 's just typical of berlin to take something tatty and turn it into something quite wonderful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.11.2010 us truce with international criminal court paves way for cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war crimes tribunals like the icc seek to end impunity from the law after years of open hostility , the us and the international criminal court have agreed to an uneasy truce .
can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
as the administration under george w. bush unilaterally waged its controversial " war on terror , " us policymakers worried that the military had become vulnerable to politically motivated indictments by the icc .
they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.11.2010 sing-along berlin ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is berlin 's status as europe 's unofficial capital of cool under threat as the city rides an enthusiastic wave of karaoke fever ?
dw 's neale lytollis and the rest of the city certainly do n't think so . karaoke has been around for a long time and , for many , does n't figure too highly on the list of credible pastimes .
the craze for singing badly to your favorite pop songs started in japan , spread throughout europe in the early 1990s and has been pretty much a drunken joke ever since . in the uk , where i come from , karaoke was one of those things you always went to but never participated in .
some balding , middle-aged , former cruise ship entertainer would set up his tv screen and piffling speakers and stumble through a couple of tom jones numbers until the tipsy housewives were brave enough to teeter to the stage and warble their way through " i will survive . "
woeful in the extreme . however , in the last year or so , berliners have rediscovered and reinvented karaoke to the extent that it is rapidly gaining legendary status as a credible and fun way to spend an evening .
while its popularity may surprise many , given the city 's reputation for being three-quarters full with po-faced hipsters who try to out-bore each other at parties , it 's not all that much of a shock to me .
i have seen the cool facade before . every now and again , the real personality of berliners flashes through . the fall of the cool facade i recall being at a see-and-be-seen party a couple of years back where all those who were n't making some token effort to vaguely sway to the monotonous pseudo-techno music , were standing around the fringes like mourners at a state funeral . the dj decided , for reasons unknown even to eminent scientists , to play " i 've had the time of my life " from " dirty dancing . "
it was as if the entire club had received a massive electric shock .
the zombified clubbers on the dance floor suddenly sprang to life , while those morose shop-window dummies around the edges leapt onto the dance floor like someone had just whacked them on the bottom with a spade .
i myself stood nodding sagely in the corner , safe in the knowledge that berliners are n't really as cool as they would have us all think . therefore karaoke 's success here is scarcely surprising .
in the summer months , locals amass in prenzlauer berg 's mauerpark in their thousands to take part in the daytime open-air karaoke , which has now taken on stadium-like proportions .
dedicated karaoke bars - bars which run regular karaoke nights - are springing up in numbers which could even rival the dog piles on the city 's streets . bildunterschrift : fancy yourself as the next tokio hotel ?
at a karaoke bar , you can be your favorite star - at least for a night the moment of conversion " come on , it 'll be fun .
it 's like being a pop star for a night ! " enthused a pal of mine , eagerly trying to convince me to join her at one of berlin 's most popular karaoke hang-outs , monster ronsons .
it was sunday night and at this time , as an alternative to hiring a private karaoke cabin , you can also sing on stage .
so , i went along not expecting very much and came away a 100-percent karaoke convert . the only song i know i can sing reasonably well is " mack the knife " by bobby darin and , figuring that if i were to go on the stage at all , i might as well not make a spectacle of myself . " given that you 're wearing a sailor shirt and knickerbockers , some might argue it 's already too late for that , " quipped my friend shortly before mysteriously acquiring something vaguely resembling a black eye . finally , after about 14 bracing beers and what seemed like an eternity , my name was called and away i went .
standing there under the spotlights , clicking my fingers and occasionally swinging my hips , i might well have been in the rat pack .
i did n't need the lyrics ; the stage - and the song - were all mine . as i hit the big finish high note at the end of the song , to say the applause was rapturous would have been an understatement .
i never heard such whooping and cheering for anything i 'd done since the day i threw a tennis ball at mrs. murphy in seventh grade french class . the berlin touch and this is where karaoke differs in berlin : whether you can sing or barely croak through your song of choice , the assembled audience will clap and cheer and dance along to your efforts , so even those with the most miserable of singing voices need n't feel embarrassed to have a go . it 's just typical of berlin to take something tatty and turn it into something quite wonderful .
now if only they could work the same magic on " dirty dancing . " neale lytollis ' dreams of a career change were dashed when a talent agent advised him that touring a one-man show was fine , but touring with only one song would be unwise . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's neale lytollis and the rest of the city certainly do n't think so . karaoke has been around for a long time and , for many , does n't figure too highly on the list of credible pastimes .
the craze for singing badly to your favorite pop songs started in japan , spread throughout europe in the early 1990s and has been pretty much a drunken joke ever since . in the uk , where i come from , karaoke was one of those things you always went to but never participated in .
some balding , middle-aged , former cruise ship entertainer would set up his tv screen and piffling speakers and stumble through a couple of tom jones numbers until the tipsy housewives were brave enough to teeter to the stage and warble their way through " i will survive . "
woeful in the extreme . however , in the last year or so , berliners have rediscovered and reinvented karaoke to the extent that it is rapidly gaining legendary status as a credible and fun way to spend an evening .
while its popularity may surprise many , given the city 's reputation for being three-quarters full with po-faced hipsters who try to out-bore each other at parties , it 's not all that much of a shock to me .
i have seen the cool facade before . every now and again , the real personality of berliners flashes through . the fall of the cool facade i recall being at a see-and-be-seen party a couple of years back where all those who were n't making some token effort to vaguely sway to the monotonous pseudo-techno music , were standing around the fringes like mourners at a state funeral . the dj decided , for reasons unknown even to eminent scientists , to play " i 've had the time of my life " from " dirty dancing .

standing there under the spotlights , clicking my fingers and occasionally swinging my hips , i might well have been in the rat pack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 19.11.2010 us truce with international criminal court paves way for cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war crimes tribunals like the icc seek to end impunity from the law after years of open hostility , the us and the international criminal court have agreed to an uneasy truce .
can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
as the administration under george w. bush unilaterally waged its controversial " war on terror , " us policymakers worried that the military had become vulnerable to politically motivated indictments by the icc .
they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they feared that an activist world court could undermine america 's ability to wage an effective war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration called a truce with the icc during its second term " the argument often brought forward within the discussion in the us is that they want to protect their soldiers , " thimm said .
" their true concern is to give the international community another forum in which decisions about us military strategy or intervention policy can be criticized and their legitimacy can be questioned . " in order to ease these concerns , congress passed the american service-members ' protection act , which prohibited us cooperation with the court .
the act empowered the president to cut aid to icc member states unless they guaranteed legal immunity for american soldiers . the us position at the time was that you were either with the united states or against it .
since the icc could not take sides , it became an unwitting political enemy of the bush administration . agreeing to disagree but as the icc began to prosecute cases , us policymakers realized they could use the court as a tool to further american objectives abroad . " in the second term of george w. bush , there were important practical changes away from the ideological campaigns that some had conducted against the court in its first years , " richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . according to dicker , there was real support for the court 's work on a practical level . " in particular , situations where the bush administration saw the congruence of us foreign policy interests and the work the court was doing , " he said . when the bush administration made the humanitarian crisis in sudan a part of its policy agenda , the icc became a useful lever to put pressure on president omar al-bashir 's regime in khartoum .
the us abstained when the security council voted to refer sudan to the icc in 2005 , indicating for the first time that washington tacitly supported the court . " if you want to take a skeptical state like the us and develop a working relationship , this is how you do it , " padmanabhan said .
" you find cases where there 's agreement between the us and the court and in those cases , the us will provide a full range of support for the court . " strategic partnership building on the policy of bush 's second term , the obama administration has turned tacit cooperation with the court into an active partnership .
during a trip to kenya in 2009 , secretary of state hillary clinton expressed regret that the us was not a signatory to the court . meanwhile , the us ambassador for war crimes stephen rapp announced the us would " return to engagement with the icc . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration supports the icc indictment of sudanese president al-bashir a series of concrete steps have followed the conciliatory rhetoric .
the obama administration sent delegations to icc conferences for the first time in years , including a crucial review conference in kampala , uganda last june . the administration has also publicly supported the icc 's indictment of al-bashir , the first sitting head of state to face an arrest warrant from the court . " there 's a change in tone , and there 's a change of rhetoric , " thimm said .
" they do n't attack the icc as much as the bush administration did , and they say they share the goals of the icc . " elephant in the room despite improved relations , the us remains unlikely to join the court in the near future .
the us senate views the icc as a potential violation of national sovereignty , making it very difficult to garner the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the rome statute .
also , the court 's recent decision to include the crime of aggression within its jurisdiction has raised red flags in washington . aggression is politically charged and poorly defined under international law , according to padmanabhan .
its inclusion would muddle the court 's " core " mandate to prosecute crimes of war , crimes against humanity and genocide .
if the crime of aggression becomes a major focus of the court 's energies , the united states could become estranged once again . yet dicker believes that if the court pursues its mission fairly and consistently , washington may eventually come around . " the only course for the court is to do its work as a judicial institution - not to cater to the united states , not to cut corners or adjust its practices in the hope that it would raise the comfort level in washington , " dicker said . author : spencer kimball editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's neale lytollis and the rest of the city certainly do n't think so . karaoke has been around for a long time and , for many , does n't figure too highly on the list of credible pastimes .
the craze for singing badly to your favorite pop songs started in japan , spread throughout europe in the early 1990s and has been pretty much a drunken joke ever since . in the uk , where i come from , karaoke was one of those things you always went to but never participated in .
some balding , middle-aged , former cruise ship entertainer would set up his tv screen and piffling speakers and stumble through a couple of tom jones numbers until the tipsy housewives were brave enough to teeter to the stage and warble their way through " i will survive . "
woeful in the extreme . however , in the last year or so , berliners have rediscovered and reinvented karaoke to the extent that it is rapidly gaining legendary status as a credible and fun way to spend an evening .
while its popularity may surprise many , given the city 's reputation for being three-quarters full with po-faced hipsters who try to out-bore each other at parties , it 's not all that much of a shock to me .
i have seen the cool facade before . every now and again , the real personality of berliners flashes through . the fall of the cool facade i recall being at a see-and-be-seen party a couple of years back where all those who were n't making some token effort to vaguely sway to the monotonous pseudo-techno music , were standing around the fringes like mourners at a state funeral . the dj decided , for reasons unknown even to eminent scientists , to play " i 've had the time of my life " from " dirty dancing . "
it was as if the entire club had received a massive electric shock .
the zombified clubbers on the dance floor suddenly sprang to life , while those morose shop-window dummies around the edges leapt onto the dance floor like someone had just whacked them on the bottom with a spade .
i myself stood nodding sagely in the corner , safe in the knowledge that berliners are n't really as cool as they would have us all think . therefore karaoke 's success here is scarcely surprising .
in the summer months , locals amass in prenzlauer berg 's mauerpark in their thousands to take part in the daytime open-air karaoke , which has now taken on stadium-like proportions .
dedicated karaoke bars - bars which run regular karaoke nights - are springing up in numbers which could even rival the dog piles on the city 's streets . bildunterschrift : fancy yourself as the next tokio hotel ?
at a karaoke bar , you can be your favorite star - at least for a night the moment of conversion " come on , it 'll be fun .
it 's like being a pop star for a night ! " enthused a pal of mine , eagerly trying to convince me to join her at one of berlin 's most popular karaoke hang-outs , monster ronsons .
it was sunday night and at this time , as an alternative to hiring a private karaoke cabin , you can also sing on stage .
so , i went along not expecting very much and came away a 100-percent karaoke convert . the only song i know i can sing reasonably well is " mack the knife " by bobby darin and , figuring that if i were to go on the stage at all , i might as well not make a spectacle of myself . " given that you 're wearing a sailor shirt and knickerbockers , some might argue it 's already too late for that , " quipped my friend shortly before mysteriously acquiring something vaguely resembling a black eye . finally , after about 14 bracing beers and what seemed like an eternity , my name was called and away i went .
standing there under the spotlights , clicking my fingers and occasionally swinging my hips , i might well have been in the rat pack .
i did n't need the lyrics ; the stage - and the song - were all mine . as i hit the big finish high note at the end of the song , to say the applause was rapturous would have been an understatement .
i never heard such whooping and cheering for anything i 'd done since the day i threw a tennis ball at mrs. murphy in seventh grade french class . the berlin touch and this is where karaoke differs in berlin : whether you can sing or barely croak through your song of choice , the assembled audience will clap and cheer and dance along to your efforts , so even those with the most miserable of singing voices need n't feel embarrassed to have a go . it 's just typical of berlin to take something tatty and turn it into something quite wonderful .
now if only they could work the same magic on " dirty dancing . " neale lytollis ' dreams of a career change were dashed when a talent agent advised him that touring a one-man show was fine , but touring with only one song would be unwise . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

can the only military superpower forge a partnership with the world 's most ambitious war crimes tribunal ? in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks , the united states severed its already strained ties with the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague .
in spite of the critical role washington played in prosecuting crimes against humanity during the 1990s , america 's political establishment harbored a bipartisan suspicion of the icc . under president barack obama , the us has dropped its outright hostility toward the world 's first permanent war crimes court and is re-evaluating its confrontational stance .
washington is now seeking a sort of strategic partnership with the court - rooted in the pursuit of common interests .
however , even as relations warm , the prospects of us membership are slim . the icc meanwhile soberly continues its task of prosecuting widely condemned war criminals .
the next major trial begins on november 22 against jean-pierre bemba , the democratic republic of congo 's former vice-president . equal justice under the law originally , the us administration under bill clinton supported the idea of a permanent tribunal to prosecute war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
but american diplomats ran into major sticking points during the negotiations that laid the foundation for the icc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community thought the security council would obstruct the icc 's work washington envisioned a court anchored in the united nations security council , which could check the power of the icc prosecutor .
ultimately , the five veto-holding countries would decide whether a case moved forward . however , the majority of nations without a veto feared the security council would simply torpedo the court 's work .
to prevent obstructionism , the international community granted the icc judicial independence within the so-called rome statute , the treaty which set up the court . " they wanted an independent court , " johannes thimm , an expert on us foreign policy at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" they wanted to prevent the possibility of double standards , and they wanted to prevent the possibility that the court could be held hostage to members of the security council . " superpower immunity meanwhile , washington worried that its critics would use the court to impeach american power .
us officials across party lines argued that as an exceptional world power with exceptional obligations , the country required exceptional guarantees that its political leaders and military officers would not be targeted by the icc 's prosecutor . " the reality is that there 's a difference between the us and other states in respect to their security obligations , " vijay padmanabhan , a former attorney-adviser at the us department of state , told deutsche welle .
" with the us committing troops as it does to the four corners of the globe , there needs to be a sense of comfort with the court that it wo n't go after us officials . " according to the rome statute , the court can only investigate a case if the responsible nation state fails to do so .
but this safeguard did little to ease the concern expressed by washington .
then when the international community refused to grant the us a special status , washington 's relationship with the icc hit an impasse . in response , the clinton administration opted for a wait-and-see approach , signing the statute without ratifying it .
in other words , washington endorsed the idea of the icc , but objected to its current structure . with us or against us ambivalence toward the court gave way to open hostility after the september 11th attacks .
