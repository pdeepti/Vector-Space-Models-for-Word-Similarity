but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 05.11.2010 foodies help save pie noir cow from extinction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slow food movement is lending a helping hand to rare cow breeds .
the pie noir cow was once the mainstay of brittany 's dairy industry .
its delicious cream was prized in produce sold from paris to the new world .
nearly wiped out last century , the breed is now enjoying a comeback . the pie noir used to be a symbol of the brittany countryside . by the end of the 19th century , it was one of the most common breeds of french cattle , numbering at least half a million .
its rich milk prompted the rise of the region 's confectionery sector , with brittany 's butter biscuits becoming famous worldwide .
" before the last 2orld war , the brittany cow was very important , " said jacques cochy , a modern-day pie noir breeder .
" the milk was given to pigs and produced very good pigs for the ' jambon de paris . '
brittany butter was very famous and was exported to paris and the usa . " today , cochy and his wife own 20 pie noir cows , as well as young calves , on their farm .
they make cheeses which they sell directly to customers .
yet for all the pie noir 's delicious milk , the cows have a low yield compared to other breeds – and this nearly cost them their existence .
pie noir 's heyday ends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pie noir cows almost disappeared from brittany 's pastures .
when industrialised farming practices began to gain popularity in the 1960s , dairy farmers started selecting mostly for yield . although pie noirs eat far less than their frisian and holstein rivals , those breeds can produce about double as much milk . " the milk was not paid for its quality , but for its quantity and the frisian -lsb- breed of cow -rsb- produced most milk , so it was most interesting , " cochy said .
by the 1970s , the brittany cows ' numbers had plummeted from the half-a-million of its heyday to a mere 350 specimens , and the breed was on the verge of extinction . yet for pie noir breeders , and their supporters in the ' slow food ' community , yield is not everything . cochy 's eyes sparkle with pride when he talks about his cows ' qualities , as if describing the sporting achievements of his own children .
as well as the creaminess of their milk , he explains how hardy they are – surviving happily in the rugged pastures of brittany , how easy they are to breed , and how they have a very high birth-survival rate .
" but people did n't want to see this when they chose to eliminate it , " said another pie noir breeder , vincent thebaud , who owns 15 of the cows .
" the problem with modern society is , when we decide to get rid of something , we only talk about its defects . "
thebaud is one of the farmers who benefited from a special protection program set up in 1976 , the first dedicated to a breed of cattle in france .
the program was designed to encourage young farmers to embrace the cow , and today there are around 50 new breeders in the union bretonne pie noir .
" today , we farmers who own brittany pie noir cows are working at promoting the cow and its produce in order to attract young people to come back to live in brittany and make cheese using the local race , " thebaud explains .
" to be able to give consumers who do n't have the possibility to work on the land the opportunity to eat its food is a second joy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frisian cow was prefered due to its higher milk yield .
slow food boost food fans were treated to that delicious opportunity at the slow food convention " salone del gusto-terra madre " in turin last month .
the pie noir breeders met like-minded customers , dubious of intensive farming because of what they consider its inferior quality and destructive nature .
the famers showed off a variety of products made from pie noir milk , including cheeses and a traditional local yogurt called gwell .
arnaud beauvais and his wife , nathalie , have a restaurant in brittany where they have been serving local cuisine for the past 20 years .
they were so impressed with the discovery of pie noir products that they now plan to introduce them to their menu .
for arnaud beauvais , the return of the pie noir has a special meaning since it is connected to childhood memories .
" i remember when i was a child i saw a lot of breton pie noir in the fields .
but now i think for the young people they do n't see it at all . "
but that may yet change .
in 2010 , the number of pie noir cows reached 1600 – a happy turn of fortune for a breed , plucked from the brink of extinction .
jacques cochy , who was president of the breeders ' union for 20 years , says pie noir supporters still have a lot of work to do when it comes to reaching out to the next generation of farmers , but he welcomes any contest based on quality : the flavours , he says , speak for themselves .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 us must tackle human rights issues , says former un torture investigator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak , former un special rapporteur on torture in an interview with deutsche welle , the former un special rapporteur on torture lauds the obama administration for joining the un human rights council .
but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 05.11.2010 canada 's point system : a model for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany continues to need high numbers of skilled workers from abroad canada takes in more immigrants per capita than any other country in the world based on a points system .
but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

by buying additional us government bonds , he said , the fed was creating problems for other economies . the us central bank 's decision to buy additional government bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy is a breach of international agreements , german finance minister schaeuble said on thursday evening . " i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .
" that was the joint policy all developed countries , even the united states , agreed on at the g20 summit in toronto . " deficits are n't the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us government spending has n't had the desired effect , schaeuble said the us plan , called quantitative easing , aims to put more money into the pockets of companies , consumers and homeowners but some financial analysts have expressed fears that it could lead to excessive inflation and an intensification of currency imbalances . schaeuble said he would not let germany 's opposition to the fed 's action get pushed to the back burner and that the issue would be addressed during the g20 summit in south korea next week . " i wish the americans every success in dealing with their big problems effectively and swiftly , " he said .
" but if they look at the successes that germany has had they will see that more and more deficits is not the way to do it . " europe 's largest economy , germany is enjoying a strong recovery from the global economic crisis and has resisted calls for scaling back its austerity measures and lowering taxes . europe 's central bank holds rate steady the fed 's billion-dollar injection also failed to convince the european central bank .
ecb president jean-claude trichet announced on thursday that the frankfurt-based bank would maintain its course of slowly shutting off the money supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chef bernanke defended the move earlier , us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke defend the monetary course of his institution . " this approach eased financial conditions in the past and , so far , looks to be effective again , " he said . schaeuble hit back by saying that the fed measures to revive the us economy have failed . " they have already pumped an endless amount of money into the economy , " the german minister said .
" the results have been dismal . " schaeuble added that the job market continues to be difficult and as does the overall economic situation . " fed could cause long-term damage " schaeuble 's harsh assessment was supported by leading economists .
the fed runs the risk of causing long-term damage , said michael huether , director of the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- .
the acquisition of government bonds by the fed is a fundamental regulative sin , he said , and it would do nothing to solve the structural problems in the us economy . german economic minister rainer bruederle also criticized the us central bank , saying that he would watch recent developments with great concern . internationally , the german politicians were joined by brazilian and chinese officials in their criticism of the us plan to buy government bonds . " everybody wants the us economy to recover , but it does no good at all to just throw dollars from a helicopter , " said brazilian finance minister guido mantega . the fed also announced wednesday that it would lower its key interest rate .
the world 's largest economy only had a growth rate of two percent in the third quarter of 2010 .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "

" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .

he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .

controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .
they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

" they will have to bear the consequences " after the warnings were sent , chinese deputy foreign minister cui tiankai made a statement to sure the message had been understood .
he told reporters that the choice for european countries and others is clear and simple .
" do they want to be part of the political games , and do they want to be part of the effort to challenge the chinese judicial system , or do they want to develop friendly relations with the chinese government and people , " he said in beijing .
" if they make the wrong choice , they will have to bear the consequences , " cui added .
a senior european diplomat in oslo who asked not to named said that most eu states will implement a " business as usual " strategy , meaning that those ambassadors who usually attend the nobel awards will also do so this year .
britain , sweden , finland , denmark , netherlands and iceland have also said they would attend the award ceremony .
so far , only china has turned down the invitation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .

in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .

" rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .

" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ?

" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market .

new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ?

in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ? " according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market . " increasing competition is also seen as a necessity in the ratings industry , and while the new licensing requirements already in place in the eu might make it harder for new players to enter the market , many want to try .
in september , 27 companies requested licenses , according to lannoo . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies did n't see the dot.com bust coming either while the debate over credit rating agencies has reached a new volume , questions about their role and responsibilities pre-date the financial crisis . chastised , the tarnished sector is no longer as resistant to regulation as it once was .
the financial sector sees the industry in a different way as well , according to whyte . " the big lesson of the crisis is you ca n't be too reliant on credit rating agencies , " he said .
" now banks and regulators see ratings from agencies as just one of the factors that come into an assessment of risk . " author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .

it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .

nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .

last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .

kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .

while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .

most of the people are extremely poor . myanmar has neither a functioning healthcare system nor good education .
human rights violations are the order of the day .
in 2007 , peaceful protests by buddhist monks were brutally quashed by the military .
this is why the country ’ s military rulers are looking for some kind of legitimacy and have called the elections , explained henning effner from the friedrich ebert foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peaceful protests by buddhist monks in 2007 were brutally suppressed " the junta has governed by decree for over 20 years , " he said .
" these elections are meant to give their military rule some kind of democratic gloss .
and it will help them counter international criticism . "
aung san suu kyi banned from elections according to the military government , these elections are supposed to be a step toward a so-called disciplined democracy .
but effner said this was empty rhetoric : " the election process in the past weeks and months has not corresponded with democratic standards .
every step - from the registration of political parties to the nomination of candidates and the election campaigns - has been strictly controlled by the military government .
the process has not been free and fair at all . "
the strict election laws have especially affected the opposition .
the laws disqualify anybody who is imprisoned .
this includes aung san suu kyi , the leader of the national league for democracy , or nld , who has spent the best part of 20 years in detention , as well as over 2000 political prisoners .
the nld has said these elections a sham and has called for a boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi could be released after the elections other smaller parties that want to take part in the elections have other hurdles to overcome .
each candidate has to pay a registration fee of $ 500 -lrb- 355 euros -rrb- . " this is more than the average annual income in myanmar and too much for most opposition parties .
therefore , some have only nominated a few candidates and others are not running at all , " said effner .
tough for opposition the weak and fractioned opposition is up against two very strong government-friendly parties - the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and the national unity party -lrb- nup -rrb- .
many of their candidates are former members of the junta , who have simply removed their uniforms .
" contrary to the opposition parties , these parties have been able to avail themselves of the regime ’ s propaganda apparatus and its financial resources for their election campaign , " said jasmin lorch from the german institute for international and security affairs .
moreover , the new constitution that was adopted in 2008 guarantees the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament .
ethnic minorities struggle many of myanmar 's 130 ethnic minorities have also formed political parties to run in the elections in the hope of being able to nurture their language , culture and identity more .
although the 2008 constitution did little to address their struggle for more self-determination and independence , it did create local parliaments in myanmar 's 14 regions .
earlier this week , however , the government said elections would not take place in certain regions with large ethnic minority populations , citing " security concerns . "

most of the people are extremely poor . myanmar has neither a functioning healthcare system nor good education .
human rights violations are the order of the day .
in 2007 , peaceful protests by buddhist monks were brutally quashed by the military .
this is why the country ’ s military rulers are looking for some kind of legitimacy and have called the elections , explained henning effner from the friedrich ebert foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peaceful protests by buddhist monks in 2007 were brutally suppressed " the junta has governed by decree for over 20 years , " he said .
" these elections are meant to give their military rule some kind of democratic gloss .
and it will help them counter international criticism . "
aung san suu kyi banned from elections according to the military government , these elections are supposed to be a step toward a so-called disciplined democracy .
but effner said this was empty rhetoric : " the election process in the past weeks and months has not corresponded with democratic standards .
every step - from the registration of political parties to the nomination of candidates and the election campaigns - has been strictly controlled by the military government .
the process has not been free and fair at all . "
the strict election laws have especially affected the opposition .
the laws disqualify anybody who is imprisoned .
this includes aung san suu kyi , the leader of the national league for democracy , or nld , who has spent the best part of 20 years in detention , as well as over 2000 political prisoners .
the nld has said these elections a sham and has called for a boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi could be released after the elections other smaller parties that want to take part in the elections have other hurdles to overcome .
each candidate has to pay a registration fee of $ 500 -lrb- 355 euros -rrb- . " this is more than the average annual income in myanmar and too much for most opposition parties .
therefore , some have only nominated a few candidates and others are not running at all , " said effner .
tough for opposition the weak and fractioned opposition is up against two very strong government-friendly parties - the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and the national unity party -lrb- nup -rrb- .
many of their candidates are former members of the junta , who have simply removed their uniforms .
" contrary to the opposition parties , these parties have been able to avail themselves of the regime ’ s propaganda apparatus and its financial resources for their election campaign , " said jasmin lorch from the german institute for international and security affairs .
moreover , the new constitution that was adopted in 2008 guarantees the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament .
ethnic minorities struggle many of myanmar 's 130 ethnic minorities have also formed political parties to run in the elections in the hope of being able to nurture their language , culture and identity more .
although the 2008 constitution did little to address their struggle for more self-determination and independence , it did create local parliaments in myanmar 's 14 regions .
earlier this week , however , the government said elections would not take place in certain regions with large ethnic minority populations , citing " security concerns . "

nobel literature laureate guenter grass has condemned the removals as a breach of human rights . the central council of german sinti and roma has appealed for deportations of roma to kosovo to be halted in a letter to the interior ministry .
the letter , written jointly with the international equality group anti-racism network , called for roma who arrived during the kosovo conflict in the 1990s to be granted german residency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was forced to defend its policy of mass deportation on tuesday , the german nobel literature laureate guenter grass said germany was guilty of an " appalling breach of human rights " over the kosovo deportations .
in an open letter to interior minister thomas de maiziere , published on the website of daily newspaper die welt , grass said children born on german soil to kosovan parents faced a future of poverty with no education if they were repatriated .
expulsions of roma have come into public focus after france began clearing roma encampments during the summer .
paris sent some 8,000 roma people from bulgaria and romania back to their countries of origin in mass deportations .
those actions strained relations between france and the european commission , and french president nicolas sarkozy was forced to defend the policy against widespread criticism .
a diplomatic misunderstanding in september , sarkozy claimed that chancellor angela merkel had told him she supported the actions , and had similar plans .
merkel denied this and the matter was later described by both parties as a misunderstanding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer guenter grass said the deportations were a breach of human rights while germany has no such encampments , as most german roma live in public housing , berlin has declined to grant residency to about 8,500 kosovan roma in the country .
the interior ministry has said it does not plan mass-deportations , but does acknowledge that a gradual repatriation is planned .
the council 's appeal was published on its website following discussions on the matter in heidelberg on friday .
kosovo , unlike bulgaria and romania , is not a member of the european union .

a diplomatic misunderstanding in september , sarkozy claimed that chancellor angela merkel had told him she supported the actions , and had similar plans .
merkel denied this and the matter was later described by both parties as a misunderstanding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer guenter grass said the deportations were a breach of human rights while germany has no such encampments , as most german roma live in public housing , berlin has declined to grant residency to about 8,500 kosovan roma in the country .
the interior ministry has said it does not plan mass-deportations , but does acknowledge that a gradual repatriation is planned .
the council 's appeal was published on its website following discussions on the matter in heidelberg on friday .
kosovo , unlike bulgaria and romania , is not a member of the european union .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 us must tackle human rights issues , says former un torture investigator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak , former un special rapporteur on torture in an interview with deutsche welle , the former un special rapporteur on torture lauds the obama administration for joining the un human rights council .
but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .

but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

by buying additional us government bonds , he said , the fed was creating problems for other economies . the us central bank 's decision to buy additional government bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy is a breach of international agreements , german finance minister schaeuble said on thursday evening . " i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .
" that was the joint policy all developed countries , even the united states , agreed on at the g20 summit in toronto . " deficits are n't the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us government spending has n't had the desired effect , schaeuble said the us plan , called quantitative easing , aims to put more money into the pockets of companies , consumers and homeowners but some financial analysts have expressed fears that it could lead to excessive inflation and an intensification of currency imbalances . schaeuble said he would not let germany 's opposition to the fed 's action get pushed to the back burner and that the issue would be addressed during the g20 summit in south korea next week . " i wish the americans every success in dealing with their big problems effectively and swiftly , " he said .
" but if they look at the successes that germany has had they will see that more and more deficits is not the way to do it . " europe 's largest economy , germany is enjoying a strong recovery from the global economic crisis and has resisted calls for scaling back its austerity measures and lowering taxes . europe 's central bank holds rate steady the fed 's billion-dollar injection also failed to convince the european central bank .
ecb president jean-claude trichet announced on thursday that the frankfurt-based bank would maintain its course of slowly shutting off the money supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chef bernanke defended the move earlier , us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke defend the monetary course of his institution . " this approach eased financial conditions in the past and , so far , looks to be effective again , " he said . schaeuble hit back by saying that the fed measures to revive the us economy have failed . " they have already pumped an endless amount of money into the economy , " the german minister said .
" the results have been dismal . " schaeuble added that the job market continues to be difficult and as does the overall economic situation . " fed could cause long-term damage " schaeuble 's harsh assessment was supported by leading economists .
the fed runs the risk of causing long-term damage , said michael huether , director of the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- .
the acquisition of government bonds by the fed is a fundamental regulative sin , he said , and it would do nothing to solve the structural problems in the us economy . german economic minister rainer bruederle also criticized the us central bank , saying that he would watch recent developments with great concern . internationally , the german politicians were joined by brazilian and chinese officials in their criticism of the us plan to buy government bonds . " everybody wants the us economy to recover , but it does no good at all to just throw dollars from a helicopter , " said brazilian finance minister guido mantega . the fed also announced wednesday that it would lower its key interest rate .

but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ? " according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market . " increasing competition is also seen as a necessity in the ratings industry , and while the new licensing requirements already in place in the eu might make it harder for new players to enter the market , many want to try .

" according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market . " increasing competition is also seen as a necessity in the ratings industry , and while the new licensing requirements already in place in the eu might make it harder for new players to enter the market , many want to try .
in september , 27 companies requested licenses , according to lannoo . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies did n't see the dot.com bust coming either while the debate over credit rating agencies has reached a new volume , questions about their role and responsibilities pre-date the financial crisis . chastised , the tarnished sector is no longer as resistant to regulation as it once was .
the financial sector sees the industry in a different way as well , according to whyte . " the big lesson of the crisis is you ca n't be too reliant on credit rating agencies , " he said .
" now banks and regulators see ratings from agencies as just one of the factors that come into an assessment of risk . " author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 05.11.2010 canada 's point system : a model for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany continues to need high numbers of skilled workers from abroad canada takes in more immigrants per capita than any other country in the world based on a points system .
but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

when we 're not crammed in like sardines with the other 40-odd thousand fanatics in various stadiums , we 're sitting on our backsides , staring myopically at big-screen televisions , often within arm 's reach of plenty of alcohol and junk food .
while punditry confines the expert to a somewhat sedentary existence , it does have its advantages .
imagine how hard it would be to find the chicken bones needed to help in this week 's predictions if we had n't just polished off an entire bargain bucket of fried poultry .
armed with greasy remnants , we can now cast them into the dirt circle at our feet and hope to make sense of the formations as we look to forecast the results of week eleven .
let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 05.11.2010 in berlin , life is still a cabaret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roaring twenties were berlin 's cultural heyday , and gave the city its reputation as a hotbed of hedonism .
weimar-era decadence is once again all the rage , as the party crowd trades in hooded tops for feather boas . on one count , berlin has always disappointed me .
seeing bob fosse 's 1972 musical " cabaret " at an impressionable age was one of the main reasons i moved here : i came expecting to find the city depicted in fritz lang 's " dr. mabuse " films , complete with old ladies straight out of otto dix paintings smoking alone in cafes and pirate jenny from " the threepenny opera " lingering on street corners .
but i soon discovered that in 21st-century berlin , few traces remain of the wanton waywardness of weimar culture . but could the " divine decadence " so beloved by sally bowles be making a comeback ?
it seems it might , judging by the popularity of the " boheme sauvage " club nights .
taking place every few months , they 're organized by the society for elegant entertainment - founded by a certain fraeulein else edelstahl - and are billed as a night for " everyone for whom less is never more , and too much is never enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the master of ceremonies and his sidekick putting on the ritz one way or another , that could apply to most people who like going out in berlin .
but these parties are different .
they pull a crowd that looks like it 's spent the last seven decades in a time-warp , and berlin has no shortage of appropriate venues to accommodate them . even though the city is legendary for makeshift clubs in former industrial warehouses , it also knows how to do faded grandeur .
" boheme sauvage " can take its pick of nightspots that hark back to the decades when berlin was considered europe 's capital of arts and culture , from the wintergarten theater on potsdamer strasse to the gruener salon at the volksbuehne once run by max reinhardt , and the oxymoron in the historic art deco hackesche hoefe . all neo-baroque stairways and gilt-edged mirrors , the venue last weekend was the heimathafen neukoelln , a popular dance hall in the 1920s and a perfect backdrop for the evening 's frolics .
there 's a line outside tailing along karl marx strasse when i get there , and i see a few sheepish looking punters in jeans and anoraks sloping off down the road who 've obviously been turned away .
the dress code is strict , but most people are more than happy to stick to it - there are n't many places in berlin where you can wear your gladrags with pride , after all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresscode at boheme sauvage is taken very seriously but i 'm amazed how seriously everyone 's taking it .
most of the men have opted for tuxedos , monocles and slicked back hair , while the women are decked out in full flapper regalia , complete with drop-waist frocks , strings of pearls and finger wave bobs .
as they enter , everyone is given a stash of reichmarks they can blow at the casino upstairs , and the tipple of choice is - aber natuerlich - absinthe .
or something like it , at least . dancing on a volcano couples are foxtrotting away on the dance floor , courtesy of a dj called dr. hirschfeld , named after the physician who founded the institute for sexology in berlin in 1919 ; there 's a doe-eyed cigarette girl milling about ; a tap-dancing conferencier called coco who rolls his rs and twirls his cane with admirable gusto ; a bix beiderbecke tribute band and a burlesque stripper called mopsy meyers . it 's nowhere near as debauched as das ambassadeur and die passage must have been back in the day , and i 'm sure the likes of anita berber , expressionist exotic dancer extraordinaire , would 've wiped the floor with mopsy meyers .
it feels more like an upmarket fancy dress party than a sordid demi-monde - a celebration of weimar licentiousness , perhaps , but stripped of the genuine depravity and sleaziness that defined the era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita berber 's performances challenged taboos but that 's probably just as well . i take a cab home at four in the morning .
the peacock feather in my headband is drooping , and i 've lost an elbow glove .
but for a minute there , watching berlin speeding by outside my window , i feel just like sally bowles . author : jane paulick photos : frederic schweizer -lrb- www.foto-sicht.de -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 us must tackle human rights issues , says former un torture investigator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak , former un special rapporteur on torture in an interview with deutsche welle , the former un special rapporteur on torture lauds the obama administration for joining the un human rights council .
but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

most of the people are extremely poor . myanmar has neither a functioning healthcare system nor good education .
human rights violations are the order of the day .
in 2007 , peaceful protests by buddhist monks were brutally quashed by the military .
this is why the country ’ s military rulers are looking for some kind of legitimacy and have called the elections , explained henning effner from the friedrich ebert foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peaceful protests by buddhist monks in 2007 were brutally suppressed " the junta has governed by decree for over 20 years , " he said .
" these elections are meant to give their military rule some kind of democratic gloss .
and it will help them counter international criticism . "
aung san suu kyi banned from elections according to the military government , these elections are supposed to be a step toward a so-called disciplined democracy .
but effner said this was empty rhetoric : " the election process in the past weeks and months has not corresponded with democratic standards .
every step - from the registration of political parties to the nomination of candidates and the election campaigns - has been strictly controlled by the military government .
the process has not been free and fair at all . "
the strict election laws have especially affected the opposition .
the laws disqualify anybody who is imprisoned .
this includes aung san suu kyi , the leader of the national league for democracy , or nld , who has spent the best part of 20 years in detention , as well as over 2000 political prisoners .
the nld has said these elections a sham and has called for a boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi could be released after the elections other smaller parties that want to take part in the elections have other hurdles to overcome .
each candidate has to pay a registration fee of $ 500 -lrb- 355 euros -rrb- . " this is more than the average annual income in myanmar and too much for most opposition parties .
therefore , some have only nominated a few candidates and others are not running at all , " said effner .
tough for opposition the weak and fractioned opposition is up against two very strong government-friendly parties - the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and the national unity party -lrb- nup -rrb- .
many of their candidates are former members of the junta , who have simply removed their uniforms .
" contrary to the opposition parties , these parties have been able to avail themselves of the regime ’ s propaganda apparatus and its financial resources for their election campaign , " said jasmin lorch from the german institute for international and security affairs .
moreover , the new constitution that was adopted in 2008 guarantees the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament .
ethnic minorities struggle many of myanmar 's 130 ethnic minorities have also formed political parties to run in the elections in the hope of being able to nurture their language , culture and identity more .
although the 2008 constitution did little to address their struggle for more self-determination and independence , it did create local parliaments in myanmar 's 14 regions .
earlier this week , however , the government said elections would not take place in certain regions with large ethnic minority populations , citing " security concerns . "

european countries joined appeals for a halt to the death penalty . the us delegation also heard demands for an end to discrimination against minorities and immigrants and defended its human rights record from criticism from foes including cuba and iran .
the debate took place in the united nations human rights council , which is gradually reviewing the performance of all 192 un member states .
" while we are proud of our achievements , we are not satisfied with the status quo .
we will continue to work to ensure that our laws are fair and justly implemented , " michael posner , assistant us secretary of state for democracy , human rights and labor , told the geneva forum .
" let there be no doubt , the united states does not and will not torture , " state department legal adviser harold koh told the council .
" this administration began by turning the page and unequivocally ensuring the humane treatment of all individuals in us custody in armed conflict , " he insisted .
long line of speakers but diplomats from countries at odds with washington - some of whom queued overnight to be among the first on the speakers ' list - hammered the us delegation for alleged abuses .
cuban ambassador rodolfo reyes rodriguez spoke first , calling on washington to end the blockade on his island country and respect the cuban people 's right to self-determination .
venezuela 's envoy german mundarain hernandez said it should " close guantanamo and secret detention centers around the world , punish those people who torture , disappear and execute detainees arbitrarily and provide compensation to victims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the review by the un human rights council is not binding iran 's delegation urged the united states to " halt serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law including covert external operations by the cia carried out on pretext of combating terrorism " .
mixed review by russia and china china and russia acknowledged progress in health and education , as well as attempts to tackle what the russian ambassador called the " more odious " human rights violations during conflicts .
but they both urged the swift closure of terror detention centers , while russia recommended " a careful investigation of the facts in the use of torture especially in guantanamo and bagram " air force base in afghanistan .
the washington post reported on thursday that former us president george w. bush wrote in his new memoir that he personally gave the go-ahead for cia officers to waterboard self-confessed 9/11 mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed .
europe calls for end to capital punishment the western reaction on allegations of torture and abuse was more muted .
european countries including britain recommended a moratorium or abolition of the death penalty , while france urged president barack obama to " honor his promise " in 2009 to close guantanamo .
koh responded : " while the commitment has not wavered , the task is complex .
president obama can not do it alone . "
a total of 172 detainees remain there , out of 242 when obama took office in 2008 , he added , insisting on the need for help from congress , the courts and us allies willing to host ex-detainees .
the 36-strong us delegation underlined the country 's constitutionally enshrined tradition on human rights and progress over the 20th century , but recognised that the us record was " not perfect . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries demanded an end to the death penalty " while there were some politically motivated conversations , overall the conversation was constructive dialogue on international human rights , " delegation chief esther brimmer , assistant secretary at the state department , told journalists afterwards .
although no action is taken in the four-yearly " universal periodic review " it exposes governments to examination by their peers and the un .

they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .

" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 05.11.2010 kosovo struggles to gain international recognition online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even though kosovo is free , it lacks a country code even though facebook has finally located pristina in kosovo , the newfound country still lacks a telephone country code and its own top-level domain name , and that may take some time to rectify . kosovo has hit a new milestone in its quest for recognition .
last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .
these letters affixed to web addresses serve as electronic flags .
brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 05.11.2010 in berlin , life is still a cabaret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roaring twenties were berlin 's cultural heyday , and gave the city its reputation as a hotbed of hedonism .
weimar-era decadence is once again all the rage , as the party crowd trades in hooded tops for feather boas . on one count , berlin has always disappointed me .
seeing bob fosse 's 1972 musical " cabaret " at an impressionable age was one of the main reasons i moved here : i came expecting to find the city depicted in fritz lang 's " dr. mabuse " films , complete with old ladies straight out of otto dix paintings smoking alone in cafes and pirate jenny from " the threepenny opera " lingering on street corners .
but i soon discovered that in 21st-century berlin , few traces remain of the wanton waywardness of weimar culture . but could the " divine decadence " so beloved by sally bowles be making a comeback ?
it seems it might , judging by the popularity of the " boheme sauvage " club nights .
taking place every few months , they 're organized by the society for elegant entertainment - founded by a certain fraeulein else edelstahl - and are billed as a night for " everyone for whom less is never more , and too much is never enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the master of ceremonies and his sidekick putting on the ritz one way or another , that could apply to most people who like going out in berlin .
but these parties are different .
they pull a crowd that looks like it 's spent the last seven decades in a time-warp , and berlin has no shortage of appropriate venues to accommodate them . even though the city is legendary for makeshift clubs in former industrial warehouses , it also knows how to do faded grandeur .
" boheme sauvage " can take its pick of nightspots that hark back to the decades when berlin was considered europe 's capital of arts and culture , from the wintergarten theater on potsdamer strasse to the gruener salon at the volksbuehne once run by max reinhardt , and the oxymoron in the historic art deco hackesche hoefe . all neo-baroque stairways and gilt-edged mirrors , the venue last weekend was the heimathafen neukoelln , a popular dance hall in the 1920s and a perfect backdrop for the evening 's frolics .
there 's a line outside tailing along karl marx strasse when i get there , and i see a few sheepish looking punters in jeans and anoraks sloping off down the road who 've obviously been turned away .
the dress code is strict , but most people are more than happy to stick to it - there are n't many places in berlin where you can wear your gladrags with pride , after all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresscode at boheme sauvage is taken very seriously but i 'm amazed how seriously everyone 's taking it .
most of the men have opted for tuxedos , monocles and slicked back hair , while the women are decked out in full flapper regalia , complete with drop-waist frocks , strings of pearls and finger wave bobs .
as they enter , everyone is given a stash of reichmarks they can blow at the casino upstairs , and the tipple of choice is - aber natuerlich - absinthe .
or something like it , at least . dancing on a volcano couples are foxtrotting away on the dance floor , courtesy of a dj called dr. hirschfeld , named after the physician who founded the institute for sexology in berlin in 1919 ; there 's a doe-eyed cigarette girl milling about ; a tap-dancing conferencier called coco who rolls his rs and twirls his cane with admirable gusto ; a bix beiderbecke tribute band and a burlesque stripper called mopsy meyers . it 's nowhere near as debauched as das ambassadeur and die passage must have been back in the day , and i 'm sure the likes of anita berber , expressionist exotic dancer extraordinaire , would 've wiped the floor with mopsy meyers .
it feels more like an upmarket fancy dress party than a sordid demi-monde - a celebration of weimar licentiousness , perhaps , but stripped of the genuine depravity and sleaziness that defined the era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita berber 's performances challenged taboos but that 's probably just as well . i take a cab home at four in the morning .
the peacock feather in my headband is drooping , and i 've lost an elbow glove .
but for a minute there , watching berlin speeding by outside my window , i feel just like sally bowles . author : jane paulick photos : frederic schweizer -lrb- www.foto-sicht.de -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.11.2010 with schalke mired in crisis , magath is on borrowed time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as schalke plumb the depths , magath feels the pressure second from bottom , 19 points behind bitter rivals and bundesliga leaders dortmund , one victory and six defeats : the story of schalke 's season to date is a woeful one .
it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .

it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .

prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .

kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .

bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .

bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .

when we 're not crammed in like sardines with the other 40-odd thousand fanatics in various stadiums , we 're sitting on our backsides , staring myopically at big-screen televisions , often within arm 's reach of plenty of alcohol and junk food .
while punditry confines the expert to a somewhat sedentary existence , it does have its advantages .
imagine how hard it would be to find the chicken bones needed to help in this week 's predictions if we had n't just polished off an entire bargain bucket of fried poultry .
armed with greasy remnants , we can now cast them into the dirt circle at our feet and hope to make sense of the formations as we look to forecast the results of week eleven .
let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .

prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .

but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 05.11.2010 canada 's point system : a model for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany continues to need high numbers of skilled workers from abroad canada takes in more immigrants per capita than any other country in the world based on a points system .
but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .

but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

by buying additional us government bonds , he said , the fed was creating problems for other economies . the us central bank 's decision to buy additional government bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy is a breach of international agreements , german finance minister schaeuble said on thursday evening . " i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .

" the results have been dismal . " schaeuble added that the job market continues to be difficult and as does the overall economic situation . " fed could cause long-term damage " schaeuble 's harsh assessment was supported by leading economists .
the fed runs the risk of causing long-term damage , said michael huether , director of the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- .

he hopes to encourage business deals to rejuvenate the us economy and also improve his re-election prospects for 2012 . bilateral trade between india and the us is expected to exceed $ us 50 billion this year .
the us hopes to double its exports to india within five years .
that 's why us president barack obama is taking 200 chief executives with him on his three-day trip to india . " when the president gets here and comes to mumbai , which is one of the financial capitals of the world , not alone of india , i think he is going to talk of this economic trade relationship and how it benefits both countries , " us ambassador to india timothy roemer predicted at a press conference . bildunterschrift : india has its eye on a permanent seat in the un security council " it creates jobs in america when we sell equipment to india to modernize its defense , when we sell clean technology to help promote a cleaner environment , when we collaborate on the second green revolution , on clean technology for climate issues .
this is a very exciting partnership . " obama to stay at hotel targeted in mumbai attacks president obama will stay at the taj palace hotel , one of several locations in the city targeted by terrorists two years ago in concerted attacks that killed over 165 people . he is expected to meet with the families of victims and deliver a speech reaffirming america 's commitment to fighting terrorism . washington is also eyeing a few multi-billion-dollar defense deals , including a $ us 10-billion project for 126 fighter bombers that the indian air force plans to buy .
two american companies - boeing and lockheed martin - are among the six contenders . skirting difficult and complicated issues ahead of his visit , the president described india as a " cornerstone " of us engagement in asia , but he made no assurances on two key issues – india ’ s bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , and ending curbs on export of dual-use technology , saying simply that both are " very difficult and complicated " . former indian ambassador to the us lalit mansingh was disappointed : " these two issues were part of the big deliverables people were expecting here .
and they were led to believe that washington was getting ready to do that . now he has thrown buckets of cold water on these , so there is very little left in terms of deliverables . " evolution of strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and us are expected to expand their counter-terrorism cooperation however , another former indian diplomat g parthasarathy was more relaxed : " this is the most powerful country we are dealing with .
i do n't mind as long as there is progress - even if it is incremental .
i don ’ t want him to be father christmas . " we demean ourselves the way we go around with a begging bowl asking for membership of the un security council .
i think the government has lost all sense of self-respect .
if it comes along , it comes along but for 60 years we have lived without it - it ’ s no big deal . " other analysts feel that obama will have to reassure new delhi that the growing alliance begun by his predecessor george w. bush is evolving into a strategic partnership . obama will be the sixth us president to visit india .
he will then go on to indonesia for the second leg of his four-nation asian trip . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the people are extremely poor . myanmar has neither a functioning healthcare system nor good education .
human rights violations are the order of the day .
in 2007 , peaceful protests by buddhist monks were brutally quashed by the military .
this is why the country ’ s military rulers are looking for some kind of legitimacy and have called the elections , explained henning effner from the friedrich ebert foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peaceful protests by buddhist monks in 2007 were brutally suppressed " the junta has governed by decree for over 20 years , " he said .
" these elections are meant to give their military rule some kind of democratic gloss .
and it will help them counter international criticism . "
aung san suu kyi banned from elections according to the military government , these elections are supposed to be a step toward a so-called disciplined democracy .
but effner said this was empty rhetoric : " the election process in the past weeks and months has not corresponded with democratic standards .
every step - from the registration of political parties to the nomination of candidates and the election campaigns - has been strictly controlled by the military government .
the process has not been free and fair at all . "
the strict election laws have especially affected the opposition .
the laws disqualify anybody who is imprisoned .
this includes aung san suu kyi , the leader of the national league for democracy , or nld , who has spent the best part of 20 years in detention , as well as over 2000 political prisoners .
the nld has said these elections a sham and has called for a boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi could be released after the elections other smaller parties that want to take part in the elections have other hurdles to overcome .
each candidate has to pay a registration fee of $ 500 -lrb- 355 euros -rrb- . " this is more than the average annual income in myanmar and too much for most opposition parties .
therefore , some have only nominated a few candidates and others are not running at all , " said effner .
tough for opposition the weak and fractioned opposition is up against two very strong government-friendly parties - the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and the national unity party -lrb- nup -rrb- .
many of their candidates are former members of the junta , who have simply removed their uniforms .
" contrary to the opposition parties , these parties have been able to avail themselves of the regime ’ s propaganda apparatus and its financial resources for their election campaign , " said jasmin lorch from the german institute for international and security affairs .
moreover , the new constitution that was adopted in 2008 guarantees the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament .
ethnic minorities struggle many of myanmar 's 130 ethnic minorities have also formed political parties to run in the elections in the hope of being able to nurture their language , culture and identity more .
although the 2008 constitution did little to address their struggle for more self-determination and independence , it did create local parliaments in myanmar 's 14 regions .
earlier this week , however , the government said elections would not take place in certain regions with large ethnic minority populations , citing " security concerns . "

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .
while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .
these letters affixed to web addresses serve as electronic flags .
brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "

kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 05.11.2010 eu eyes tougher regulation for credit rating agencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies got blamed for the financial crisis the eu called for additional rules to curb ratings agencies , a sector much criticized in the wake of the financial crisis .
new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ? " according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market .

the law requires users to provide their real name and id card number in order to leave comments on sites that receive more than 100,000 unique visitors per day . however , cristian pantazi , the chief editor of romania 's largest online portal hotnews.ro , considers this approach to be a mistake . " for one thing , that would open up pandora 's box , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

but diplomats are resisting the demands . european embassies in norwegian capital oslo have received calls from their chinese counterpart to shun the nobel awards ceremony in december .
chinese dissident liu xiaobo , who is serving an 11-year jail term on subversion charges for advocating democracy and multi-party rule , will be honored at the event .
china 's embassy in oslo sent out letters explicitly warning eu envoys against showing up at the ceremony on december 10 , telling them to refrain from " activities aimed against china . "
" we attend as we do every year " " we had an exchange between european embassies in oslo regarding the note , " jan friedrich , deputy chief of germany 's embassy in oslo said .
" our position is clear , we will attend as we do every year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the only country that has refused its nobel ceremony invitation friedrich said he is going to attend the ceremony in place of the german ambassador , who will be on a trip at the time .
olof huldtgren , deputy head at the swedish embassy in oslo said that the letter " does not explicitly say do n't participate in the nobel ceremony , but reading between the lines , the message is clear . "
" they will have to bear the consequences " after the warnings were sent , chinese deputy foreign minister cui tiankai made a statement to sure the message had been understood .
he told reporters that the choice for european countries and others is clear and simple .
" do they want to be part of the political games , and do they want to be part of the effort to challenge the chinese judicial system , or do they want to develop friendly relations with the chinese government and people , " he said in beijing .
" if they make the wrong choice , they will have to bear the consequences , " cui added .
a senior european diplomat in oslo who asked not to named said that most eu states will implement a " business as usual " strategy , meaning that those ambassadors who usually attend the nobel awards will also do so this year .

but diplomats are resisting the demands . european embassies in norwegian capital oslo have received calls from their chinese counterpart to shun the nobel awards ceremony in december .
chinese dissident liu xiaobo , who is serving an 11-year jail term on subversion charges for advocating democracy and multi-party rule , will be honored at the event .
china 's embassy in oslo sent out letters explicitly warning eu envoys against showing up at the ceremony on december 10 , telling them to refrain from " activities aimed against china . "
" we attend as we do every year " " we had an exchange between european embassies in oslo regarding the note , " jan friedrich , deputy chief of germany 's embassy in oslo said .
" our position is clear , we will attend as we do every year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the only country that has refused its nobel ceremony invitation friedrich said he is going to attend the ceremony in place of the german ambassador , who will be on a trip at the time .
olof huldtgren , deputy head at the swedish embassy in oslo said that the letter " does not explicitly say do n't participate in the nobel ceremony , but reading between the lines , the message is clear . "
" they will have to bear the consequences " after the warnings were sent , chinese deputy foreign minister cui tiankai made a statement to sure the message had been understood .
he told reporters that the choice for european countries and others is clear and simple .
" do they want to be part of the political games , and do they want to be part of the effort to challenge the chinese judicial system , or do they want to develop friendly relations with the chinese government and people , " he said in beijing .
" if they make the wrong choice , they will have to bear the consequences , " cui added .
a senior european diplomat in oslo who asked not to named said that most eu states will implement a " business as usual " strategy , meaning that those ambassadors who usually attend the nobel awards will also do so this year .
britain , sweden , finland , denmark , netherlands and iceland have also said they would attend the award ceremony .
so far , only china has turned down the invitation .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .
they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .
they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

" i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .
" that was the joint policy all developed countries , even the united states , agreed on at the g20 summit in toronto . " deficits are n't the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us government spending has n't had the desired effect , schaeuble said the us plan , called quantitative easing , aims to put more money into the pockets of companies , consumers and homeowners but some financial analysts have expressed fears that it could lead to excessive inflation and an intensification of currency imbalances . schaeuble said he would not let germany 's opposition to the fed 's action get pushed to the back burner and that the issue would be addressed during the g20 summit in south korea next week . " i wish the americans every success in dealing with their big problems effectively and swiftly , " he said .
" but if they look at the successes that germany has had they will see that more and more deficits is not the way to do it . " europe 's largest economy , germany is enjoying a strong recovery from the global economic crisis and has resisted calls for scaling back its austerity measures and lowering taxes . europe 's central bank holds rate steady the fed 's billion-dollar injection also failed to convince the european central bank .
ecb president jean-claude trichet announced on thursday that the frankfurt-based bank would maintain its course of slowly shutting off the money supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chef bernanke defended the move earlier , us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke defend the monetary course of his institution . " this approach eased financial conditions in the past and , so far , looks to be effective again , " he said . schaeuble hit back by saying that the fed measures to revive the us economy have failed . " they have already pumped an endless amount of money into the economy , " the german minister said .
" the results have been dismal . " schaeuble added that the job market continues to be difficult and as does the overall economic situation . " fed could cause long-term damage " schaeuble 's harsh assessment was supported by leading economists .
the fed runs the risk of causing long-term damage , said michael huether , director of the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- .
the acquisition of government bonds by the fed is a fundamental regulative sin , he said , and it would do nothing to solve the structural problems in the us economy . german economic minister rainer bruederle also criticized the us central bank , saying that he would watch recent developments with great concern . internationally , the german politicians were joined by brazilian and chinese officials in their criticism of the us plan to buy government bonds . " everybody wants the us economy to recover , but it does no good at all to just throw dollars from a helicopter , " said brazilian finance minister guido mantega . the fed also announced wednesday that it would lower its key interest rate .
the world 's largest economy only had a growth rate of two percent in the third quarter of 2010 .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "

ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .

when we 're not crammed in like sardines with the other 40-odd thousand fanatics in various stadiums , we 're sitting on our backsides , staring myopically at big-screen televisions , often within arm 's reach of plenty of alcohol and junk food .
while punditry confines the expert to a somewhat sedentary existence , it does have its advantages .
imagine how hard it would be to find the chicken bones needed to help in this week 's predictions if we had n't just polished off an entire bargain bucket of fried poultry .
armed with greasy remnants , we can now cast them into the dirt circle at our feet and hope to make sense of the formations as we look to forecast the results of week eleven .
let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .

the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

when we 're not crammed in like sardines with the other 40-odd thousand fanatics in various stadiums , we 're sitting on our backsides , staring myopically at big-screen televisions , often within arm 's reach of plenty of alcohol and junk food .
while punditry confines the expert to a somewhat sedentary existence , it does have its advantages .
imagine how hard it would be to find the chicken bones needed to help in this week 's predictions if we had n't just polished off an entire bargain bucket of fried poultry .
armed with greasy remnants , we can now cast them into the dirt circle at our feet and hope to make sense of the formations as we look to forecast the results of week eleven .
let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 us must tackle human rights issues , says former un torture investigator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak , former un special rapporteur on torture in an interview with deutsche welle , the former un special rapporteur on torture lauds the obama administration for joining the un human rights council .
but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

weimar-era decadence is once again all the rage , as the party crowd trades in hooded tops for feather boas . on one count , berlin has always disappointed me .
seeing bob fosse 's 1972 musical " cabaret " at an impressionable age was one of the main reasons i moved here : i came expecting to find the city depicted in fritz lang 's " dr. mabuse " films , complete with old ladies straight out of otto dix paintings smoking alone in cafes and pirate jenny from " the threepenny opera " lingering on street corners .
but i soon discovered that in 21st-century berlin , few traces remain of the wanton waywardness of weimar culture . but could the " divine decadence " so beloved by sally bowles be making a comeback ?
it seems it might , judging by the popularity of the " boheme sauvage " club nights .
taking place every few months , they 're organized by the society for elegant entertainment - founded by a certain fraeulein else edelstahl - and are billed as a night for " everyone for whom less is never more , and too much is never enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the master of ceremonies and his sidekick putting on the ritz one way or another , that could apply to most people who like going out in berlin .
but these parties are different .
they pull a crowd that looks like it 's spent the last seven decades in a time-warp , and berlin has no shortage of appropriate venues to accommodate them . even though the city is legendary for makeshift clubs in former industrial warehouses , it also knows how to do faded grandeur .
" boheme sauvage " can take its pick of nightspots that hark back to the decades when berlin was considered europe 's capital of arts and culture , from the wintergarten theater on potsdamer strasse to the gruener salon at the volksbuehne once run by max reinhardt , and the oxymoron in the historic art deco hackesche hoefe . all neo-baroque stairways and gilt-edged mirrors , the venue last weekend was the heimathafen neukoelln , a popular dance hall in the 1920s and a perfect backdrop for the evening 's frolics .
there 's a line outside tailing along karl marx strasse when i get there , and i see a few sheepish looking punters in jeans and anoraks sloping off down the road who 've obviously been turned away .
the dress code is strict , but most people are more than happy to stick to it - there are n't many places in berlin where you can wear your gladrags with pride , after all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresscode at boheme sauvage is taken very seriously but i 'm amazed how seriously everyone 's taking it .
most of the men have opted for tuxedos , monocles and slicked back hair , while the women are decked out in full flapper regalia , complete with drop-waist frocks , strings of pearls and finger wave bobs .
as they enter , everyone is given a stash of reichmarks they can blow at the casino upstairs , and the tipple of choice is - aber natuerlich - absinthe .
or something like it , at least . dancing on a volcano couples are foxtrotting away on the dance floor , courtesy of a dj called dr. hirschfeld , named after the physician who founded the institute for sexology in berlin in 1919 ; there 's a doe-eyed cigarette girl milling about ; a tap-dancing conferencier called coco who rolls his rs and twirls his cane with admirable gusto ; a bix beiderbecke tribute band and a burlesque stripper called mopsy meyers . it 's nowhere near as debauched as das ambassadeur and die passage must have been back in the day , and i 'm sure the likes of anita berber , expressionist exotic dancer extraordinaire , would 've wiped the floor with mopsy meyers .
it feels more like an upmarket fancy dress party than a sordid demi-monde - a celebration of weimar licentiousness , perhaps , but stripped of the genuine depravity and sleaziness that defined the era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita berber 's performances challenged taboos but that 's probably just as well . i take a cab home at four in the morning .

but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 us must tackle human rights issues , says former un torture investigator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak , former un special rapporteur on torture in an interview with deutsche welle , the former un special rapporteur on torture lauds the obama administration for joining the un human rights council .
but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

the dress code is strict , but most people are more than happy to stick to it - there are n't many places in berlin where you can wear your gladrags with pride , after all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresscode at boheme sauvage is taken very seriously but i 'm amazed how seriously everyone 's taking it .
most of the men have opted for tuxedos , monocles and slicked back hair , while the women are decked out in full flapper regalia , complete with drop-waist frocks , strings of pearls and finger wave bobs .
as they enter , everyone is given a stash of reichmarks they can blow at the casino upstairs , and the tipple of choice is - aber natuerlich - absinthe .
or something like it , at least . dancing on a volcano couples are foxtrotting away on the dance floor , courtesy of a dj called dr. hirschfeld , named after the physician who founded the institute for sexology in berlin in 1919 ; there 's a doe-eyed cigarette girl milling about ; a tap-dancing conferencier called coco who rolls his rs and twirls his cane with admirable gusto ; a bix beiderbecke tribute band and a burlesque stripper called mopsy meyers . it 's nowhere near as debauched as das ambassadeur and die passage must have been back in the day , and i 'm sure the likes of anita berber , expressionist exotic dancer extraordinaire , would 've wiped the floor with mopsy meyers .
it feels more like an upmarket fancy dress party than a sordid demi-monde - a celebration of weimar licentiousness , perhaps , but stripped of the genuine depravity and sleaziness that defined the era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita berber 's performances challenged taboos but that 's probably just as well . i take a cab home at four in the morning .
the peacock feather in my headband is drooping , and i 've lost an elbow glove .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.11.2010 with schalke mired in crisis , magath is on borrowed time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as schalke plumb the depths , magath feels the pressure second from bottom , 19 points behind bitter rivals and bundesliga leaders dortmund , one victory and six defeats : the story of schalke 's season to date is a woeful one .
it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .

kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

when we 're not crammed in like sardines with the other 40-odd thousand fanatics in various stadiums , we 're sitting on our backsides , staring myopically at big-screen televisions , often within arm 's reach of plenty of alcohol and junk food .
while punditry confines the expert to a somewhat sedentary existence , it does have its advantages .
imagine how hard it would be to find the chicken bones needed to help in this week 's predictions if we had n't just polished off an entire bargain bucket of fried poultry .
armed with greasy remnants , we can now cast them into the dirt circle at our feet and hope to make sense of the formations as we look to forecast the results of week eleven .
let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .

as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "

" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .

they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .

controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .

by buying additional us government bonds , he said , the fed was creating problems for other economies . the us central bank 's decision to buy additional government bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy is a breach of international agreements , german finance minister schaeuble said on thursday evening . " i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .

turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

nobel literature laureate guenter grass has condemned the removals as a breach of human rights . the central council of german sinti and roma has appealed for deportations of roma to kosovo to be halted in a letter to the interior ministry .
the letter , written jointly with the international equality group anti-racism network , called for roma who arrived during the kosovo conflict in the 1990s to be granted german residency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france was forced to defend its policy of mass deportation on tuesday , the german nobel literature laureate guenter grass said germany was guilty of an " appalling breach of human rights " over the kosovo deportations .
in an open letter to interior minister thomas de maiziere , published on the website of daily newspaper die welt , grass said children born on german soil to kosovan parents faced a future of poverty with no education if they were repatriated .
expulsions of roma have come into public focus after france began clearing roma encampments during the summer .
paris sent some 8,000 roma people from bulgaria and romania back to their countries of origin in mass deportations .
those actions strained relations between france and the european commission , and french president nicolas sarkozy was forced to defend the policy against widespread criticism .
a diplomatic misunderstanding in september , sarkozy claimed that chancellor angela merkel had told him she supported the actions , and had similar plans .
merkel denied this and the matter was later described by both parties as a misunderstanding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writer guenter grass said the deportations were a breach of human rights while germany has no such encampments , as most german roma live in public housing , berlin has declined to grant residency to about 8,500 kosovan roma in the country .
the interior ministry has said it does not plan mass-deportations , but does acknowledge that a gradual repatriation is planned .
the council 's appeal was published on its website following discussions on the matter in heidelberg on friday .
kosovo , unlike bulgaria and romania , is not a member of the european union .

this is why the country ’ s military rulers are looking for some kind of legitimacy and have called the elections , explained henning effner from the friedrich ebert foundation .

" these elections are meant to give their military rule some kind of democratic gloss .
and it will help them counter international criticism . "
aung san suu kyi banned from elections according to the military government , these elections are supposed to be a step toward a so-called disciplined democracy .
but effner said this was empty rhetoric : " the election process in the past weeks and months has not corresponded with democratic standards .
every step - from the registration of political parties to the nomination of candidates and the election campaigns - has been strictly controlled by the military government .
the process has not been free and fair at all . "
the strict election laws have especially affected the opposition .
the laws disqualify anybody who is imprisoned .
this includes aung san suu kyi , the leader of the national league for democracy , or nld , who has spent the best part of 20 years in detention , as well as over 2000 political prisoners .
the nld has said these elections a sham and has called for a boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi could be released after the elections other smaller parties that want to take part in the elections have other hurdles to overcome .
each candidate has to pay a registration fee of $ 500 -lrb- 355 euros -rrb- . " this is more than the average annual income in myanmar and too much for most opposition parties .
therefore , some have only nominated a few candidates and others are not running at all , " said effner .
tough for opposition the weak and fractioned opposition is up against two very strong government-friendly parties - the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and the national unity party -lrb- nup -rrb- .
many of their candidates are former members of the junta , who have simply removed their uniforms .
" contrary to the opposition parties , these parties have been able to avail themselves of the regime ’ s propaganda apparatus and its financial resources for their election campaign , " said jasmin lorch from the german institute for international and security affairs .
moreover , the new constitution that was adopted in 2008 guarantees the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament .
ethnic minorities struggle many of myanmar 's 130 ethnic minorities have also formed political parties to run in the elections in the hope of being able to nurture their language , culture and identity more .
although the 2008 constitution did little to address their struggle for more self-determination and independence , it did create local parliaments in myanmar 's 14 regions .
earlier this week , however , the government said elections would not take place in certain regions with large ethnic minority populations , citing " security concerns . "

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .

" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .

in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .
while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .

brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.11.2010 elections in myanmar are unlikely to be ' free and fair ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national league for democracy has called for an election boycott as myanmar , also known as burma , prepares for elections , human rights organizations and many western governments have voiced concerns that sunday 's poll will not be ' free and fair ' and have criticized the ruling junta . the country 's economy is shattered .
most of the people are extremely poor . myanmar has neither a functioning healthcare system nor good education .
human rights violations are the order of the day .
in 2007 , peaceful protests by buddhist monks were brutally quashed by the military .
this is why the country ’ s military rulers are looking for some kind of legitimacy and have called the elections , explained henning effner from the friedrich ebert foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peaceful protests by buddhist monks in 2007 were brutally suppressed " the junta has governed by decree for over 20 years , " he said .
" these elections are meant to give their military rule some kind of democratic gloss .
and it will help them counter international criticism . "
aung san suu kyi banned from elections according to the military government , these elections are supposed to be a step toward a so-called disciplined democracy .
but effner said this was empty rhetoric : " the election process in the past weeks and months has not corresponded with democratic standards .
every step - from the registration of political parties to the nomination of candidates and the election campaigns - has been strictly controlled by the military government .
the process has not been free and fair at all . "
the strict election laws have especially affected the opposition .
the laws disqualify anybody who is imprisoned .
this includes aung san suu kyi , the leader of the national league for democracy , or nld , who has spent the best part of 20 years in detention , as well as over 2000 political prisoners .
the nld has said these elections a sham and has called for a boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi could be released after the elections other smaller parties that want to take part in the elections have other hurdles to overcome .
each candidate has to pay a registration fee of $ 500 -lrb- 355 euros -rrb- . " this is more than the average annual income in myanmar and too much for most opposition parties .
therefore , some have only nominated a few candidates and others are not running at all , " said effner .
tough for opposition the weak and fractioned opposition is up against two very strong government-friendly parties - the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and the national unity party -lrb- nup -rrb- .
many of their candidates are former members of the junta , who have simply removed their uniforms .
" contrary to the opposition parties , these parties have been able to avail themselves of the regime ’ s propaganda apparatus and its financial resources for their election campaign , " said jasmin lorch from the german institute for international and security affairs .
moreover , the new constitution that was adopted in 2008 guarantees the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament .
ethnic minorities struggle many of myanmar 's 130 ethnic minorities have also formed political parties to run in the elections in the hope of being able to nurture their language , culture and identity more .
although the 2008 constitution did little to address their struggle for more self-determination and independence , it did create local parliaments in myanmar 's 14 regions .
earlier this week , however , the government said elections would not take place in certain regions with large ethnic minority populations , citing " security concerns . "

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .
while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

by buying additional us government bonds , he said , the fed was creating problems for other economies . the us central bank 's decision to buy additional government bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy is a breach of international agreements , german finance minister schaeuble said on thursday evening . " i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .
" that was the joint policy all developed countries , even the united states , agreed on at the g20 summit in toronto . " deficits are n't the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us government spending has n't had the desired effect , schaeuble said the us plan , called quantitative easing , aims to put more money into the pockets of companies , consumers and homeowners but some financial analysts have expressed fears that it could lead to excessive inflation and an intensification of currency imbalances . schaeuble said he would not let germany 's opposition to the fed 's action get pushed to the back burner and that the issue would be addressed during the g20 summit in south korea next week . " i wish the americans every success in dealing with their big problems effectively and swiftly , " he said .
" but if they look at the successes that germany has had they will see that more and more deficits is not the way to do it . " europe 's largest economy , germany is enjoying a strong recovery from the global economic crisis and has resisted calls for scaling back its austerity measures and lowering taxes . europe 's central bank holds rate steady the fed 's billion-dollar injection also failed to convince the european central bank .
ecb president jean-claude trichet announced on thursday that the frankfurt-based bank would maintain its course of slowly shutting off the money supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chef bernanke defended the move earlier , us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke defend the monetary course of his institution . " this approach eased financial conditions in the past and , so far , looks to be effective again , " he said . schaeuble hit back by saying that the fed measures to revive the us economy have failed . " they have already pumped an endless amount of money into the economy , " the german minister said .
" the results have been dismal . " schaeuble added that the job market continues to be difficult and as does the overall economic situation . " fed could cause long-term damage " schaeuble 's harsh assessment was supported by leading economists .
the fed runs the risk of causing long-term damage , said michael huether , director of the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- .
the acquisition of government bonds by the fed is a fundamental regulative sin , he said , and it would do nothing to solve the structural problems in the us economy . german economic minister rainer bruederle also criticized the us central bank , saying that he would watch recent developments with great concern . internationally , the german politicians were joined by brazilian and chinese officials in their criticism of the us plan to buy government bonds . " everybody wants the us economy to recover , but it does no good at all to just throw dollars from a helicopter , " said brazilian finance minister guido mantega . the fed also announced wednesday that it would lower its key interest rate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 05.11.2010 eu eyes tougher regulation for credit rating agencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies got blamed for the financial crisis the eu called for additional rules to curb ratings agencies , a sector much criticized in the wake of the financial crisis .
new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ? " according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market . " increasing competition is also seen as a necessity in the ratings industry , and while the new licensing requirements already in place in the eu might make it harder for new players to enter the market , many want to try .
in september , 27 companies requested licenses , according to lannoo . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies did n't see the dot.com bust coming either while the debate over credit rating agencies has reached a new volume , questions about their role and responsibilities pre-date the financial crisis . chastised , the tarnished sector is no longer as resistant to regulation as it once was .
the financial sector sees the industry in a different way as well , according to whyte . " the big lesson of the crisis is you ca n't be too reliant on credit rating agencies , " he said .
" now banks and regulators see ratings from agencies as just one of the factors that come into an assessment of risk . " author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .
they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

he hopes to encourage business deals to rejuvenate the us economy and also improve his re-election prospects for 2012 . bilateral trade between india and the us is expected to exceed $ us 50 billion this year .
the us hopes to double its exports to india within five years .
that 's why us president barack obama is taking 200 chief executives with him on his three-day trip to india . " when the president gets here and comes to mumbai , which is one of the financial capitals of the world , not alone of india , i think he is going to talk of this economic trade relationship and how it benefits both countries , " us ambassador to india timothy roemer predicted at a press conference . bildunterschrift : india has its eye on a permanent seat in the un security council " it creates jobs in america when we sell equipment to india to modernize its defense , when we sell clean technology to help promote a cleaner environment , when we collaborate on the second green revolution , on clean technology for climate issues .
this is a very exciting partnership . " obama to stay at hotel targeted in mumbai attacks president obama will stay at the taj palace hotel , one of several locations in the city targeted by terrorists two years ago in concerted attacks that killed over 165 people . he is expected to meet with the families of victims and deliver a speech reaffirming america 's commitment to fighting terrorism . washington is also eyeing a few multi-billion-dollar defense deals , including a $ us 10-billion project for 126 fighter bombers that the indian air force plans to buy .
two american companies - boeing and lockheed martin - are among the six contenders . skirting difficult and complicated issues ahead of his visit , the president described india as a " cornerstone " of us engagement in asia , but he made no assurances on two key issues – india ’ s bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , and ending curbs on export of dual-use technology , saying simply that both are " very difficult and complicated " . former indian ambassador to the us lalit mansingh was disappointed : " these two issues were part of the big deliverables people were expecting here .
and they were led to believe that washington was getting ready to do that . now he has thrown buckets of cold water on these , so there is very little left in terms of deliverables . " evolution of strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and us are expected to expand their counter-terrorism cooperation however , another former indian diplomat g parthasarathy was more relaxed : " this is the most powerful country we are dealing with .
i do n't mind as long as there is progress - even if it is incremental .
i don ’ t want him to be father christmas . " we demean ourselves the way we go around with a begging bowl asking for membership of the un security council .
i think the government has lost all sense of self-respect .
if it comes along , it comes along but for 60 years we have lived without it - it ’ s no big deal . " other analysts feel that obama will have to reassure new delhi that the growing alliance begun by his predecessor george w. bush is evolving into a strategic partnership . obama will be the sixth us president to visit india .
he will then go on to indonesia for the second leg of his four-nation asian trip . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

but not all are in favor of less anonymity online . the political culture in kosovo , and in many of its neighboring countries like macedonia , albania and romania , is often personal and vitriolic and with early elections set for december 12 after last week 's no-confidence vote , it looks like politicians are about to start up their mud-slinging campaigns . it 's common for politicians to insult each other on a personal level .
but now , political parties are migrating to the internet and are hiring rhetorical mercenaries to start online flame wars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a volatile region like kosovo , tensions can build up online this type of behavior happens in china , with the so-called " 50-cent party , " a nationalistic group of government-paid chinese bloggers .
in the united states , there have been reporters of congressional staffers altering wikipedia entries .
however , this kind of paid online vitriol has n't been as widely observed in southeastern europe . going undercover romanian journalist vlad ursulean went undercover during the 2009 romanian presidential election campaign .
after creating a fake online persona on facebook , he got hired . " every day i received by e-mail a list with 30 - 40 links to articles from the online press , but also a list of various blogs and forums , " he told deutsche welle . " they told me that i should write comments to these entries .
they told me , for example , that president traian basescu was personally to blame for to all grievances in the country , or that rival candidate mircea geoana had committed certain crimes .
in other words , to make direct attacks against the candidates . " after his research , ursulean confirmed that all the major romanian parties took part in such practices .
but romania is certainly not alone . bulgarian parties follow suit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians pay people to leave often inflammatory comments on news websites and blogs " we can assume that some of the posts were written or influenced by party members , " said haralan alexandrov , an anthropologist at the new bulgarian university . " such posts are very often dismissed in the forums with the note that the author is a ' paid user , " ' alexandrov added .
" i can say that the bulgarian internet forums are very uncivilized . " sometimes , the comments devolve into racist and xenophobic territory , and in balkan countries , with a long history of violent ethnic conflict , that type of language can be inflammatory and potentially dangerous . " among internet users , there is a war that can be observed not only here in kosovo , but throughout the balkans , " ibrahim makolli of the kosovo journalists ' association told deutsche welle .
" there are expressions of great intolerance between different ethnic groups in the balkans . " but makolli said he does n't think hate speech has a serious , or even dangerous effect on the public .
in his view , it is more of individual phenomena .
sometimes , though , the insults and threats can even come against human rights activists , particularly against those fighting for the rights of homosexuals and ethnic minorities . macedonian student faced online death threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a macedonian student received online death threats for publishing lesbian erotica for example , one facebook group targeted irena cvetkovic , a macedonian graduate student who was threatened after she published lesbian erotic fiction and challenged the fact that her university 's textbooks called homosexuality a disease . one threat read : " justice for her , either pistol or knife .
it 's her choice . " her case was even brought up in a 2009 report by the helsinki committee for human rights of the republic of macedonia .
but cvetkovic herself remains undaunted by the threats . " i let these kinds of things happen - i 'm neither deterred nor offended , " she told deutsche welle , adding that she 's tried to ignore this hate speech as much as possible . desire for more online restrictions the romanian government has tried using legislation to tackle the problem .
one member of parliament put forward a bill that would centralize and monitor all comment functions on all romanian websites . if countries like romania , albania , kosovo and others intend to crack down on aggressive online speech through legislation , south korea could be an example .
in 2009 , seoul put is cyber defamation law into effect .
the law requires users to provide their real name and id card number in order to leave comments on sites that receive more than 100,000 unique visitors per day . however , cristian pantazi , the chief editor of romania 's largest online portal hotnews.ro , considers this approach to be a mistake . " for one thing , that would open up pandora 's box , " he said .

by buying additional us government bonds , he said , the fed was creating problems for other economies . the us central bank 's decision to buy additional government bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy is a breach of international agreements , german finance minister schaeuble said on thursday evening . " i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .
" that was the joint policy all developed countries , even the united states , agreed on at the g20 summit in toronto . " deficits are n't the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us government spending has n't had the desired effect , schaeuble said the us plan , called quantitative easing , aims to put more money into the pockets of companies , consumers and homeowners but some financial analysts have expressed fears that it could lead to excessive inflation and an intensification of currency imbalances . schaeuble said he would not let germany 's opposition to the fed 's action get pushed to the back burner and that the issue would be addressed during the g20 summit in south korea next week .

but not all are in favor of less anonymity online . the political culture in kosovo , and in many of its neighboring countries like macedonia , albania and romania , is often personal and vitriolic and with early elections set for december 12 after last week 's no-confidence vote , it looks like politicians are about to start up their mud-slinging campaigns . it 's common for politicians to insult each other on a personal level .
but now , political parties are migrating to the internet and are hiring rhetorical mercenaries to start online flame wars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a volatile region like kosovo , tensions can build up online this type of behavior happens in china , with the so-called " 50-cent party , " a nationalistic group of government-paid chinese bloggers .
in the united states , there have been reporters of congressional staffers altering wikipedia entries .
however , this kind of paid online vitriol has n't been as widely observed in southeastern europe . going undercover romanian journalist vlad ursulean went undercover during the 2009 romanian presidential election campaign .
after creating a fake online persona on facebook , he got hired . " every day i received by e-mail a list with 30 - 40 links to articles from the online press , but also a list of various blogs and forums , " he told deutsche welle . " they told me that i should write comments to these entries .
they told me , for example , that president traian basescu was personally to blame for to all grievances in the country , or that rival candidate mircea geoana had committed certain crimes .
in other words , to make direct attacks against the candidates . " after his research , ursulean confirmed that all the major romanian parties took part in such practices .
but romania is certainly not alone . bulgarian parties follow suit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians pay people to leave often inflammatory comments on news websites and blogs " we can assume that some of the posts were written or influenced by party members , " said haralan alexandrov , an anthropologist at the new bulgarian university . " such posts are very often dismissed in the forums with the note that the author is a ' paid user , " ' alexandrov added .
" i can say that the bulgarian internet forums are very uncivilized . " sometimes , the comments devolve into racist and xenophobic territory , and in balkan countries , with a long history of violent ethnic conflict , that type of language can be inflammatory and potentially dangerous . " among internet users , there is a war that can be observed not only here in kosovo , but throughout the balkans , " ibrahim makolli of the kosovo journalists ' association told deutsche welle .
" there are expressions of great intolerance between different ethnic groups in the balkans . " but makolli said he does n't think hate speech has a serious , or even dangerous effect on the public .
in his view , it is more of individual phenomena .
sometimes , though , the insults and threats can even come against human rights activists , particularly against those fighting for the rights of homosexuals and ethnic minorities . macedonian student faced online death threats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a macedonian student received online death threats for publishing lesbian erotica for example , one facebook group targeted irena cvetkovic , a macedonian graduate student who was threatened after she published lesbian erotic fiction and challenged the fact that her university 's textbooks called homosexuality a disease . one threat read : " justice for her , either pistol or knife .
it 's her choice . " her case was even brought up in a 2009 report by the helsinki committee for human rights of the republic of macedonia .
but cvetkovic herself remains undaunted by the threats . " i let these kinds of things happen - i 'm neither deterred nor offended , " she told deutsche welle , adding that she 's tried to ignore this hate speech as much as possible . desire for more online restrictions the romanian government has tried using legislation to tackle the problem .
one member of parliament put forward a bill that would centralize and monitor all comment functions on all romanian websites . if countries like romania , albania , kosovo and others intend to crack down on aggressive online speech through legislation , south korea could be an example .
in 2009 , seoul put is cyber defamation law into effect .
the law requires users to provide their real name and id card number in order to leave comments on sites that receive more than 100,000 unique visitors per day . however , cristian pantazi , the chief editor of romania 's largest online portal hotnews.ro , considers this approach to be a mistake . " for one thing , that would open up pandora 's box , " he said .
" once you set up one barrier on the internet , it paves the way for many more restrictions . " author : alexandra scherle -lrb- cjf -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "

this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .
they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ? " according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market . " increasing competition is also seen as a necessity in the ratings industry , and while the new licensing requirements already in place in the eu might make it harder for new players to enter the market , many want to try .
in september , 27 companies requested licenses , according to lannoo . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies did n't see the dot.com bust coming either while the debate over credit rating agencies has reached a new volume , questions about their role and responsibilities pre-date the financial crisis . chastised , the tarnished sector is no longer as resistant to regulation as it once was .
the financial sector sees the industry in a different way as well , according to whyte . " the big lesson of the crisis is you ca n't be too reliant on credit rating agencies , " he said .
" now banks and regulators see ratings from agencies as just one of the factors that come into an assessment of risk . " author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he hopes to encourage business deals to rejuvenate the us economy and also improve his re-election prospects for 2012 . bilateral trade between india and the us is expected to exceed $ us 50 billion this year .
the us hopes to double its exports to india within five years .
that 's why us president barack obama is taking 200 chief executives with him on his three-day trip to india . " when the president gets here and comes to mumbai , which is one of the financial capitals of the world , not alone of india , i think he is going to talk of this economic trade relationship and how it benefits both countries , " us ambassador to india timothy roemer predicted at a press conference . bildunterschrift : india has its eye on a permanent seat in the un security council " it creates jobs in america when we sell equipment to india to modernize its defense , when we sell clean technology to help promote a cleaner environment , when we collaborate on the second green revolution , on clean technology for climate issues .
this is a very exciting partnership . " obama to stay at hotel targeted in mumbai attacks president obama will stay at the taj palace hotel , one of several locations in the city targeted by terrorists two years ago in concerted attacks that killed over 165 people . he is expected to meet with the families of victims and deliver a speech reaffirming america 's commitment to fighting terrorism . washington is also eyeing a few multi-billion-dollar defense deals , including a $ us 10-billion project for 126 fighter bombers that the indian air force plans to buy .
two american companies - boeing and lockheed martin - are among the six contenders . skirting difficult and complicated issues ahead of his visit , the president described india as a " cornerstone " of us engagement in asia , but he made no assurances on two key issues – india ’ s bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , and ending curbs on export of dual-use technology , saying simply that both are " very difficult and complicated " . former indian ambassador to the us lalit mansingh was disappointed : " these two issues were part of the big deliverables people were expecting here .

i don ’ t want him to be father christmas . " we demean ourselves the way we go around with a begging bowl asking for membership of the un security council .
i think the government has lost all sense of self-respect .
if it comes along , it comes along but for 60 years we have lived without it - it ’ s no big deal . " other analysts feel that obama will have to reassure new delhi that the growing alliance begun by his predecessor george w. bush is evolving into a strategic partnership . obama will be the sixth us president to visit india .

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .
while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

most of the people are extremely poor . myanmar has neither a functioning healthcare system nor good education .
human rights violations are the order of the day .
in 2007 , peaceful protests by buddhist monks were brutally quashed by the military .
this is why the country ’ s military rulers are looking for some kind of legitimacy and have called the elections , explained henning effner from the friedrich ebert foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peaceful protests by buddhist monks in 2007 were brutally suppressed " the junta has governed by decree for over 20 years , " he said .
" these elections are meant to give their military rule some kind of democratic gloss .
and it will help them counter international criticism . "
aung san suu kyi banned from elections according to the military government , these elections are supposed to be a step toward a so-called disciplined democracy .
but effner said this was empty rhetoric : " the election process in the past weeks and months has not corresponded with democratic standards .
every step - from the registration of political parties to the nomination of candidates and the election campaigns - has been strictly controlled by the military government .
the process has not been free and fair at all . "
the strict election laws have especially affected the opposition .
the laws disqualify anybody who is imprisoned .
this includes aung san suu kyi , the leader of the national league for democracy , or nld , who has spent the best part of 20 years in detention , as well as over 2000 political prisoners .
the nld has said these elections a sham and has called for a boycott .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi could be released after the elections other smaller parties that want to take part in the elections have other hurdles to overcome .
each candidate has to pay a registration fee of $ 500 -lrb- 355 euros -rrb- . " this is more than the average annual income in myanmar and too much for most opposition parties .
therefore , some have only nominated a few candidates and others are not running at all , " said effner .
tough for opposition the weak and fractioned opposition is up against two very strong government-friendly parties - the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and the national unity party -lrb- nup -rrb- .
many of their candidates are former members of the junta , who have simply removed their uniforms .
" contrary to the opposition parties , these parties have been able to avail themselves of the regime ’ s propaganda apparatus and its financial resources for their election campaign , " said jasmin lorch from the german institute for international and security affairs .
moreover , the new constitution that was adopted in 2008 guarantees the military 25 percent of the seats in parliament .
ethnic minorities struggle many of myanmar 's 130 ethnic minorities have also formed political parties to run in the elections in the hope of being able to nurture their language , culture and identity more .
although the 2008 constitution did little to address their struggle for more self-determination and independence , it did create local parliaments in myanmar 's 14 regions .
earlier this week , however , the government said elections would not take place in certain regions with large ethnic minority populations , citing " security concerns . "

new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ? " according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market . " increasing competition is also seen as a necessity in the ratings industry , and while the new licensing requirements already in place in the eu might make it harder for new players to enter the market , many want to try .
in september , 27 companies requested licenses , according to lannoo . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies did n't see the dot.com bust coming either while the debate over credit rating agencies has reached a new volume , questions about their role and responsibilities pre-date the financial crisis . chastised , the tarnished sector is no longer as resistant to regulation as it once was .
the financial sector sees the industry in a different way as well , according to whyte . " the big lesson of the crisis is you ca n't be too reliant on credit rating agencies , " he said .
" now banks and regulators see ratings from agencies as just one of the factors that come into an assessment of risk . " author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.11.2010 myanmar officials cancel vote in ethnic minority areas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar is preparing for elections on sunday , november 7 myanmar , also known as burma , will hold its first parliamentary elections in 20 years on sunday .
but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .
while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .
these letters affixed to web addresses serve as electronic flags .
brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .

they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .

they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .
they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 05.11.2010 eu eyes tougher regulation for credit rating agencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies got blamed for the financial crisis the eu called for additional rules to curb ratings agencies , a sector much criticized in the wake of the financial crisis .
new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .

new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .

he hopes to encourage business deals to rejuvenate the us economy and also improve his re-election prospects for 2012 . bilateral trade between india and the us is expected to exceed $ us 50 billion this year .
the us hopes to double its exports to india within five years .
that 's why us president barack obama is taking 200 chief executives with him on his three-day trip to india . " when the president gets here and comes to mumbai , which is one of the financial capitals of the world , not alone of india , i think he is going to talk of this economic trade relationship and how it benefits both countries , " us ambassador to india timothy roemer predicted at a press conference . bildunterschrift : india has its eye on a permanent seat in the un security council " it creates jobs in america when we sell equipment to india to modernize its defense , when we sell clean technology to help promote a cleaner environment , when we collaborate on the second green revolution , on clean technology for climate issues .
this is a very exciting partnership . " obama to stay at hotel targeted in mumbai attacks president obama will stay at the taj palace hotel , one of several locations in the city targeted by terrorists two years ago in concerted attacks that killed over 165 people . he is expected to meet with the families of victims and deliver a speech reaffirming america 's commitment to fighting terrorism . washington is also eyeing a few multi-billion-dollar defense deals , including a $ us 10-billion project for 126 fighter bombers that the indian air force plans to buy .
two american companies - boeing and lockheed martin - are among the six contenders . skirting difficult and complicated issues ahead of his visit , the president described india as a " cornerstone " of us engagement in asia , but he made no assurances on two key issues – india ’ s bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , and ending curbs on export of dual-use technology , saying simply that both are " very difficult and complicated " . former indian ambassador to the us lalit mansingh was disappointed : " these two issues were part of the big deliverables people were expecting here .
and they were led to believe that washington was getting ready to do that . now he has thrown buckets of cold water on these , so there is very little left in terms of deliverables . " evolution of strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and us are expected to expand their counter-terrorism cooperation however , another former indian diplomat g parthasarathy was more relaxed : " this is the most powerful country we are dealing with .
i do n't mind as long as there is progress - even if it is incremental .
i don ’ t want him to be father christmas . " we demean ourselves the way we go around with a begging bowl asking for membership of the un security council .
i think the government has lost all sense of self-respect .
if it comes along , it comes along but for 60 years we have lived without it - it ’ s no big deal . " other analysts feel that obama will have to reassure new delhi that the growing alliance begun by his predecessor george w. bush is evolving into a strategic partnership . obama will be the sixth us president to visit india .
he will then go on to indonesia for the second leg of his four-nation asian trip . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 05.11.2010 kosovo struggles to gain international recognition online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even though kosovo is free , it lacks a country code even though facebook has finally located pristina in kosovo , the newfound country still lacks a telephone country code and its own top-level domain name , and that may take some time to rectify . kosovo has hit a new milestone in its quest for recognition .
last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .
these letters affixed to web addresses serve as electronic flags .
brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.11.2010 myanmar officials cancel vote in ethnic minority areas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar is preparing for elections on sunday , november 7 myanmar , also known as burma , will hold its first parliamentary elections in 20 years on sunday .
but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .
while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 05.11.2010 eu eyes tougher regulation for credit rating agencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies got blamed for the financial crisis the eu called for additional rules to curb ratings agencies , a sector much criticized in the wake of the financial crisis .
new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ? " according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market . " increasing competition is also seen as a necessity in the ratings industry , and while the new licensing requirements already in place in the eu might make it harder for new players to enter the market , many want to try .
in september , 27 companies requested licenses , according to lannoo . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies did n't see the dot.com bust coming either while the debate over credit rating agencies has reached a new volume , questions about their role and responsibilities pre-date the financial crisis . chastised , the tarnished sector is no longer as resistant to regulation as it once was .
the financial sector sees the industry in a different way as well , according to whyte . " the big lesson of the crisis is you ca n't be too reliant on credit rating agencies , " he said .
" now banks and regulators see ratings from agencies as just one of the factors that come into an assessment of risk . " author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 05.11.2010 kosovo struggles to gain international recognition online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even though kosovo is free , it lacks a country code even though facebook has finally located pristina in kosovo , the newfound country still lacks a telephone country code and its own top-level domain name , and that may take some time to rectify . kosovo has hit a new milestone in its quest for recognition .
last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .
these letters affixed to web addresses serve as electronic flags .
brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

but diplomats are resisting the demands . european embassies in norwegian capital oslo have received calls from their chinese counterpart to shun the nobel awards ceremony in december .
chinese dissident liu xiaobo , who is serving an 11-year jail term on subversion charges for advocating democracy and multi-party rule , will be honored at the event .
china 's embassy in oslo sent out letters explicitly warning eu envoys against showing up at the ceremony on december 10 , telling them to refrain from " activities aimed against china . "
" we attend as we do every year " " we had an exchange between european embassies in oslo regarding the note , " jan friedrich , deputy chief of germany 's embassy in oslo said .
" our position is clear , we will attend as we do every year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the only country that has refused its nobel ceremony invitation friedrich said he is going to attend the ceremony in place of the german ambassador , who will be on a trip at the time .
olof huldtgren , deputy head at the swedish embassy in oslo said that the letter " does not explicitly say do n't participate in the nobel ceremony , but reading between the lines , the message is clear . "
" they will have to bear the consequences " after the warnings were sent , chinese deputy foreign minister cui tiankai made a statement to sure the message had been understood .
he told reporters that the choice for european countries and others is clear and simple .
" do they want to be part of the political games , and do they want to be part of the effort to challenge the chinese judicial system , or do they want to develop friendly relations with the chinese government and people , " he said in beijing .
" if they make the wrong choice , they will have to bear the consequences , " cui added .
a senior european diplomat in oslo who asked not to named said that most eu states will implement a " business as usual " strategy , meaning that those ambassadors who usually attend the nobel awards will also do so this year .
britain , sweden , finland , denmark , netherlands and iceland have also said they would attend the award ceremony .
so far , only china has turned down the invitation .

when we 're not crammed in like sardines with the other 40-odd thousand fanatics in various stadiums , we 're sitting on our backsides , staring myopically at big-screen televisions , often within arm 's reach of plenty of alcohol and junk food .
while punditry confines the expert to a somewhat sedentary existence , it does have its advantages .

armed with greasy remnants , we can now cast them into the dirt circle at our feet and hope to make sense of the formations as we look to forecast the results of week eleven .
let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.11.2010 with schalke mired in crisis , magath is on borrowed time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as schalke plumb the depths , magath feels the pressure second from bottom , 19 points behind bitter rivals and bundesliga leaders dortmund , one victory and six defeats : the story of schalke 's season to date is a woeful one .
it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

" let there be no doubt , the united states does not and will not torture , " state department legal adviser harold koh told the council .
" this administration began by turning the page and unequivocally ensuring the humane treatment of all individuals in us custody in armed conflict , " he insisted .
long line of speakers but diplomats from countries at odds with washington - some of whom queued overnight to be among the first on the speakers ' list - hammered the us delegation for alleged abuses .
cuban ambassador rodolfo reyes rodriguez spoke first , calling on washington to end the blockade on his island country and respect the cuban people 's right to self-determination .
venezuela 's envoy german mundarain hernandez said it should " close guantanamo and secret detention centers around the world , punish those people who torture , disappear and execute detainees arbitrarily and provide compensation to victims . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the review by the un human rights council is not binding iran 's delegation urged the united states to " halt serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law including covert external operations by the cia carried out on pretext of combating terrorism " .
mixed review by russia and china china and russia acknowledged progress in health and education , as well as attempts to tackle what the russian ambassador called the " more odious " human rights violations during conflicts .
but they both urged the swift closure of terror detention centers , while russia recommended " a careful investigation of the facts in the use of torture especially in guantanamo and bagram " air force base in afghanistan .
the washington post reported on thursday that former us president george w. bush wrote in his new memoir that he personally gave the go-ahead for cia officers to waterboard self-confessed 9/11 mastermind khalid sheikh mohammed .
europe calls for end to capital punishment the western reaction on allegations of torture and abuse was more muted .
european countries including britain recommended a moratorium or abolition of the death penalty , while france urged president barack obama to " honor his promise " in 2009 to close guantanamo .
koh responded : " while the commitment has not wavered , the task is complex .
president obama can not do it alone . "
a total of 172 detainees remain there , out of 242 when obama took office in 2008 , he added , insisting on the need for help from congress , the courts and us allies willing to host ex-detainees .
the 36-strong us delegation underlined the country 's constitutionally enshrined tradition on human rights and progress over the 20th century , but recognised that the us record was " not perfect . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european countries demanded an end to the death penalty " while there were some politically motivated conversations , overall the conversation was constructive dialogue on international human rights , " delegation chief esther brimmer , assistant secretary at the state department , told journalists afterwards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

when we 're not crammed in like sardines with the other 40-odd thousand fanatics in various stadiums , we 're sitting on our backsides , staring myopically at big-screen televisions , often within arm 's reach of plenty of alcohol and junk food .
while punditry confines the expert to a somewhat sedentary existence , it does have its advantages .
imagine how hard it would be to find the chicken bones needed to help in this week 's predictions if we had n't just polished off an entire bargain bucket of fried poultry .
armed with greasy remnants , we can now cast them into the dirt circle at our feet and hope to make sense of the formations as we look to forecast the results of week eleven .
let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

weimar-era decadence is once again all the rage , as the party crowd trades in hooded tops for feather boas . on one count , berlin has always disappointed me .
seeing bob fosse 's 1972 musical " cabaret " at an impressionable age was one of the main reasons i moved here : i came expecting to find the city depicted in fritz lang 's " dr. mabuse " films , complete with old ladies straight out of otto dix paintings smoking alone in cafes and pirate jenny from " the threepenny opera " lingering on street corners .
but i soon discovered that in 21st-century berlin , few traces remain of the wanton waywardness of weimar culture . but could the " divine decadence " so beloved by sally bowles be making a comeback ?
it seems it might , judging by the popularity of the " boheme sauvage " club nights .

they pull a crowd that looks like it 's spent the last seven decades in a time-warp , and berlin has no shortage of appropriate venues to accommodate them . even though the city is legendary for makeshift clubs in former industrial warehouses , it also knows how to do faded grandeur .
" boheme sauvage " can take its pick of nightspots that hark back to the decades when berlin was considered europe 's capital of arts and culture , from the wintergarten theater on potsdamer strasse to the gruener salon at the volksbuehne once run by max reinhardt , and the oxymoron in the historic art deco hackesche hoefe . all neo-baroque stairways and gilt-edged mirrors , the venue last weekend was the heimathafen neukoelln , a popular dance hall in the 1920s and a perfect backdrop for the evening 's frolics .

weimar-era decadence is once again all the rage , as the party crowd trades in hooded tops for feather boas . on one count , berlin has always disappointed me .
seeing bob fosse 's 1972 musical " cabaret " at an impressionable age was one of the main reasons i moved here : i came expecting to find the city depicted in fritz lang 's " dr. mabuse " films , complete with old ladies straight out of otto dix paintings smoking alone in cafes and pirate jenny from " the threepenny opera " lingering on street corners .
but i soon discovered that in 21st-century berlin , few traces remain of the wanton waywardness of weimar culture . but could the " divine decadence " so beloved by sally bowles be making a comeback ?
it seems it might , judging by the popularity of the " boheme sauvage " club nights .
taking place every few months , they 're organized by the society for elegant entertainment - founded by a certain fraeulein else edelstahl - and are billed as a night for " everyone for whom less is never more , and too much is never enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the master of ceremonies and his sidekick putting on the ritz one way or another , that could apply to most people who like going out in berlin .
but these parties are different .
they pull a crowd that looks like it 's spent the last seven decades in a time-warp , and berlin has no shortage of appropriate venues to accommodate them . even though the city is legendary for makeshift clubs in former industrial warehouses , it also knows how to do faded grandeur .
" boheme sauvage " can take its pick of nightspots that hark back to the decades when berlin was considered europe 's capital of arts and culture , from the wintergarten theater on potsdamer strasse to the gruener salon at the volksbuehne once run by max reinhardt , and the oxymoron in the historic art deco hackesche hoefe . all neo-baroque stairways and gilt-edged mirrors , the venue last weekend was the heimathafen neukoelln , a popular dance hall in the 1920s and a perfect backdrop for the evening 's frolics .
there 's a line outside tailing along karl marx strasse when i get there , and i see a few sheepish looking punters in jeans and anoraks sloping off down the road who 've obviously been turned away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.11.2010 with schalke mired in crisis , magath is on borrowed time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as schalke plumb the depths , magath feels the pressure second from bottom , 19 points behind bitter rivals and bundesliga leaders dortmund , one victory and six defeats : the story of schalke 's season to date is a woeful one .
it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .

let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 postcard from europe : uk prisoners to get the vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year there are a record 85,000 prisoners in the uk the uk has a blanket ban on voting for all inmates , but the policy is in breach of european human rights legislation .
as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.11.2010 with schalke mired in crisis , magath is on borrowed time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as schalke plumb the depths , magath feels the pressure second from bottom , 19 points behind bitter rivals and bundesliga leaders dortmund , one victory and six defeats : the story of schalke 's season to date is a woeful one .
it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

he hopes to encourage business deals to rejuvenate the us economy and also improve his re-election prospects for 2012 . bilateral trade between india and the us is expected to exceed $ us 50 billion this year .
the us hopes to double its exports to india within five years .
that 's why us president barack obama is taking 200 chief executives with him on his three-day trip to india . " when the president gets here and comes to mumbai , which is one of the financial capitals of the world , not alone of india , i think he is going to talk of this economic trade relationship and how it benefits both countries , " us ambassador to india timothy roemer predicted at a press conference . bildunterschrift : india has its eye on a permanent seat in the un security council " it creates jobs in america when we sell equipment to india to modernize its defense , when we sell clean technology to help promote a cleaner environment , when we collaborate on the second green revolution , on clean technology for climate issues .
this is a very exciting partnership . " obama to stay at hotel targeted in mumbai attacks president obama will stay at the taj palace hotel , one of several locations in the city targeted by terrorists two years ago in concerted attacks that killed over 165 people . he is expected to meet with the families of victims and deliver a speech reaffirming america 's commitment to fighting terrorism . washington is also eyeing a few multi-billion-dollar defense deals , including a $ us 10-billion project for 126 fighter bombers that the indian air force plans to buy .
two american companies - boeing and lockheed martin - are among the six contenders . skirting difficult and complicated issues ahead of his visit , the president described india as a " cornerstone " of us engagement in asia , but he made no assurances on two key issues – india ’ s bid to become a permanent member of the un security council , and ending curbs on export of dual-use technology , saying simply that both are " very difficult and complicated " . former indian ambassador to the us lalit mansingh was disappointed : " these two issues were part of the big deliverables people were expecting here .
and they were led to believe that washington was getting ready to do that . now he has thrown buckets of cold water on these , so there is very little left in terms of deliverables . " evolution of strategic partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india and us are expected to expand their counter-terrorism cooperation however , another former indian diplomat g parthasarathy was more relaxed : " this is the most powerful country we are dealing with .
i do n't mind as long as there is progress - even if it is incremental .
i don ’ t want him to be father christmas . " we demean ourselves the way we go around with a begging bowl asking for membership of the un security council .
i think the government has lost all sense of self-respect .
if it comes along , it comes along but for 60 years we have lived without it - it ’ s no big deal . " other analysts feel that obama will have to reassure new delhi that the growing alliance begun by his predecessor george w. bush is evolving into a strategic partnership . obama will be the sixth us president to visit india .
he will then go on to indonesia for the second leg of his four-nation asian trip . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .
they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.11.2010 with schalke mired in crisis , magath is on borrowed time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as schalke plumb the depths , magath feels the pressure second from bottom , 19 points behind bitter rivals and bundesliga leaders dortmund , one victory and six defeats : the story of schalke 's season to date is a woeful one .
it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

when we 're not crammed in like sardines with the other 40-odd thousand fanatics in various stadiums , we 're sitting on our backsides , staring myopically at big-screen televisions , often within arm 's reach of plenty of alcohol and junk food .
while punditry confines the expert to a somewhat sedentary existence , it does have its advantages .
imagine how hard it would be to find the chicken bones needed to help in this week 's predictions if we had n't just polished off an entire bargain bucket of fried poultry .
armed with greasy remnants , we can now cast them into the dirt circle at our feet and hope to make sense of the formations as we look to forecast the results of week eleven .
let the bones fall where they may … friday , nov .
5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

by buying additional us government bonds , he said , the fed was creating problems for other economies . the us central bank 's decision to buy additional government bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy is a breach of international agreements , german finance minister schaeuble said on thursday evening . " i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .
" that was the joint policy all developed countries , even the united states , agreed on at the g20 summit in toronto . " deficits are n't the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us government spending has n't had the desired effect , schaeuble said the us plan , called quantitative easing , aims to put more money into the pockets of companies , consumers and homeowners but some financial analysts have expressed fears that it could lead to excessive inflation and an intensification of currency imbalances . schaeuble said he would not let germany 's opposition to the fed 's action get pushed to the back burner and that the issue would be addressed during the g20 summit in south korea next week . " i wish the americans every success in dealing with their big problems effectively and swiftly , " he said .
" but if they look at the successes that germany has had they will see that more and more deficits is not the way to do it . " europe 's largest economy , germany is enjoying a strong recovery from the global economic crisis and has resisted calls for scaling back its austerity measures and lowering taxes . europe 's central bank holds rate steady the fed 's billion-dollar injection also failed to convince the european central bank .
ecb president jean-claude trichet announced on thursday that the frankfurt-based bank would maintain its course of slowly shutting off the money supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chef bernanke defended the move earlier , us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke defend the monetary course of his institution . " this approach eased financial conditions in the past and , so far , looks to be effective again , " he said . schaeuble hit back by saying that the fed measures to revive the us economy have failed . " they have already pumped an endless amount of money into the economy , " the german minister said .
" the results have been dismal . " schaeuble added that the job market continues to be difficult and as does the overall economic situation . " fed could cause long-term damage " schaeuble 's harsh assessment was supported by leading economists .
the fed runs the risk of causing long-term damage , said michael huether , director of the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- .
the acquisition of government bonds by the fed is a fundamental regulative sin , he said , and it would do nothing to solve the structural problems in the us economy . german economic minister rainer bruederle also criticized the us central bank , saying that he would watch recent developments with great concern . internationally , the german politicians were joined by brazilian and chinese officials in their criticism of the us plan to buy government bonds . " everybody wants the us economy to recover , but it does no good at all to just throw dollars from a helicopter , " said brazilian finance minister guido mantega . the fed also announced wednesday that it would lower its key interest rate .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .
new constitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia must show cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal meanwhile , turkey , which has been in stalled entry talks since 2005 , still needs to do more to strengthen its democratic process , the draft said .
ankara was praised for a recent referendum that added a battery of amendments to its constitution , including reducing the military influence on courts , but the report added that the nation 's best bet to reanimate its bid would be to adopt a new constitution .
" a new civilian constitution would provide a solid base for a further strengthening of democracy in turkey , in line with european standards and the eu accession criteria , " the report said , calling the amendments passed in september 's referendum " an important step in the right direction . "
turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.11.2010 with schalke mired in crisis , magath is on borrowed time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as schalke plumb the depths , magath feels the pressure second from bottom , 19 points behind bitter rivals and bundesliga leaders dortmund , one victory and six defeats : the story of schalke 's season to date is a woeful one .
it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .

schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .

5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .
luckily , they face schalke this week .
felix magath 's team are all over the place and even the strict disciplinarian and championship-winning coach ca n't knock them into shape .
the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 saturday , nov .
6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 05.11.2010 in berlin , life is still a cabaret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roaring twenties were berlin 's cultural heyday , and gave the city its reputation as a hotbed of hedonism .
weimar-era decadence is once again all the rage , as the party crowd trades in hooded tops for feather boas . on one count , berlin has always disappointed me .
seeing bob fosse 's 1972 musical " cabaret " at an impressionable age was one of the main reasons i moved here : i came expecting to find the city depicted in fritz lang 's " dr. mabuse " films , complete with old ladies straight out of otto dix paintings smoking alone in cafes and pirate jenny from " the threepenny opera " lingering on street corners .
but i soon discovered that in 21st-century berlin , few traces remain of the wanton waywardness of weimar culture . but could the " divine decadence " so beloved by sally bowles be making a comeback ?
it seems it might , judging by the popularity of the " boheme sauvage " club nights .
taking place every few months , they 're organized by the society for elegant entertainment - founded by a certain fraeulein else edelstahl - and are billed as a night for " everyone for whom less is never more , and too much is never enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the master of ceremonies and his sidekick putting on the ritz one way or another , that could apply to most people who like going out in berlin .
but these parties are different .
they pull a crowd that looks like it 's spent the last seven decades in a time-warp , and berlin has no shortage of appropriate venues to accommodate them . even though the city is legendary for makeshift clubs in former industrial warehouses , it also knows how to do faded grandeur .
" boheme sauvage " can take its pick of nightspots that hark back to the decades when berlin was considered europe 's capital of arts and culture , from the wintergarten theater on potsdamer strasse to the gruener salon at the volksbuehne once run by max reinhardt , and the oxymoron in the historic art deco hackesche hoefe . all neo-baroque stairways and gilt-edged mirrors , the venue last weekend was the heimathafen neukoelln , a popular dance hall in the 1920s and a perfect backdrop for the evening 's frolics .
there 's a line outside tailing along karl marx strasse when i get there , and i see a few sheepish looking punters in jeans and anoraks sloping off down the road who 've obviously been turned away .
the dress code is strict , but most people are more than happy to stick to it - there are n't many places in berlin where you can wear your gladrags with pride , after all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresscode at boheme sauvage is taken very seriously but i 'm amazed how seriously everyone 's taking it .
most of the men have opted for tuxedos , monocles and slicked back hair , while the women are decked out in full flapper regalia , complete with drop-waist frocks , strings of pearls and finger wave bobs .
as they enter , everyone is given a stash of reichmarks they can blow at the casino upstairs , and the tipple of choice is - aber natuerlich - absinthe .
or something like it , at least . dancing on a volcano couples are foxtrotting away on the dance floor , courtesy of a dj called dr. hirschfeld , named after the physician who founded the institute for sexology in berlin in 1919 ; there 's a doe-eyed cigarette girl milling about ; a tap-dancing conferencier called coco who rolls his rs and twirls his cane with admirable gusto ; a bix beiderbecke tribute band and a burlesque stripper called mopsy meyers . it 's nowhere near as debauched as das ambassadeur and die passage must have been back in the day , and i 'm sure the likes of anita berber , expressionist exotic dancer extraordinaire , would 've wiped the floor with mopsy meyers .
it feels more like an upmarket fancy dress party than a sordid demi-monde - a celebration of weimar licentiousness , perhaps , but stripped of the genuine depravity and sleaziness that defined the era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita berber 's performances challenged taboos but that 's probably just as well . i take a cab home at four in the morning .
the peacock feather in my headband is drooping , and i 've lost an elbow glove .
but for a minute there , watching berlin speeding by outside my window , i feel just like sally bowles . author : jane paulick photos : frederic schweizer -lrb- www.foto-sicht.de -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 05.11.2010 in berlin , life is still a cabaret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roaring twenties were berlin 's cultural heyday , and gave the city its reputation as a hotbed of hedonism .
weimar-era decadence is once again all the rage , as the party crowd trades in hooded tops for feather boas . on one count , berlin has always disappointed me .
seeing bob fosse 's 1972 musical " cabaret " at an impressionable age was one of the main reasons i moved here : i came expecting to find the city depicted in fritz lang 's " dr. mabuse " films , complete with old ladies straight out of otto dix paintings smoking alone in cafes and pirate jenny from " the threepenny opera " lingering on street corners .
but i soon discovered that in 21st-century berlin , few traces remain of the wanton waywardness of weimar culture . but could the " divine decadence " so beloved by sally bowles be making a comeback ?
it seems it might , judging by the popularity of the " boheme sauvage " club nights .
taking place every few months , they 're organized by the society for elegant entertainment - founded by a certain fraeulein else edelstahl - and are billed as a night for " everyone for whom less is never more , and too much is never enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the master of ceremonies and his sidekick putting on the ritz one way or another , that could apply to most people who like going out in berlin .
but these parties are different .
they pull a crowd that looks like it 's spent the last seven decades in a time-warp , and berlin has no shortage of appropriate venues to accommodate them . even though the city is legendary for makeshift clubs in former industrial warehouses , it also knows how to do faded grandeur .
" boheme sauvage " can take its pick of nightspots that hark back to the decades when berlin was considered europe 's capital of arts and culture , from the wintergarten theater on potsdamer strasse to the gruener salon at the volksbuehne once run by max reinhardt , and the oxymoron in the historic art deco hackesche hoefe . all neo-baroque stairways and gilt-edged mirrors , the venue last weekend was the heimathafen neukoelln , a popular dance hall in the 1920s and a perfect backdrop for the evening 's frolics .
there 's a line outside tailing along karl marx strasse when i get there , and i see a few sheepish looking punters in jeans and anoraks sloping off down the road who 've obviously been turned away .
the dress code is strict , but most people are more than happy to stick to it - there are n't many places in berlin where you can wear your gladrags with pride , after all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresscode at boheme sauvage is taken very seriously but i 'm amazed how seriously everyone 's taking it .
most of the men have opted for tuxedos , monocles and slicked back hair , while the women are decked out in full flapper regalia , complete with drop-waist frocks , strings of pearls and finger wave bobs .
as they enter , everyone is given a stash of reichmarks they can blow at the casino upstairs , and the tipple of choice is - aber natuerlich - absinthe .
or something like it , at least . dancing on a volcano couples are foxtrotting away on the dance floor , courtesy of a dj called dr. hirschfeld , named after the physician who founded the institute for sexology in berlin in 1919 ; there 's a doe-eyed cigarette girl milling about ; a tap-dancing conferencier called coco who rolls his rs and twirls his cane with admirable gusto ; a bix beiderbecke tribute band and a burlesque stripper called mopsy meyers . it 's nowhere near as debauched as das ambassadeur and die passage must have been back in the day , and i 'm sure the likes of anita berber , expressionist exotic dancer extraordinaire , would 've wiped the floor with mopsy meyers .
it feels more like an upmarket fancy dress party than a sordid demi-monde - a celebration of weimar licentiousness , perhaps , but stripped of the genuine depravity and sleaziness that defined the era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita berber 's performances challenged taboos but that 's probably just as well . i take a cab home at four in the morning .
the peacock feather in my headband is drooping , and i 've lost an elbow glove .
but for a minute there , watching berlin speeding by outside my window , i feel just like sally bowles . author : jane paulick photos : frederic schweizer -lrb- www.foto-sicht.de -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .
while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .
police have already dispersed protesters blocking a road near the southern german town of metzingen , traditionally the site where the first protests kick off .
they have also removed a rock placed on the railway route by suspected anti-nuclear activists near the town of dahlingen . transport costs taxpayers dear the police union 's chairman , rainer wendt , meanwhile called on the german nuclear industry to help pay the expenses of providing security for the transport .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .
he estimated the cost of the transport to taxpayers at over 50 million euros -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many critics consider gorleben unsuitable as a storage site the interior minister of the northern state of lower saxony , uwe schuenemann , called on chancellor angela merkel to recompense his state to the tune of 25 million euros for the costs incurred for the transport .
controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .
with surveys showing a majority of germans opposed to the use of nuclear power , the red “ x ” used at the gorleben protests could become a ever more frequently seen symbol in germany over the coming years .

by buying additional us government bonds , he said , the fed was creating problems for other economies . the us central bank 's decision to buy additional government bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy is a breach of international agreements , german finance minister schaeuble said on thursday evening . " i do n't think that the americans are going to solve their problems with this , and i believe that it is going to create extra problems for the world , " wolfgang schaeuble said on public television thursday . the decision to buy $ 600 billion -lrb- 420 billion euros -rrb- worth of government bonds , made by the us federal reserve during a two-day meeting earlier this week , contradicts an agreement made by g20 leaders , schaeuble said . " these huge economic problems can not be solved with more debt , " schaeuble told reporters in berlin .
" that was the joint policy all developed countries , even the united states , agreed on at the g20 summit in toronto . " deficits are n't the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us government spending has n't had the desired effect , schaeuble said the us plan , called quantitative easing , aims to put more money into the pockets of companies , consumers and homeowners but some financial analysts have expressed fears that it could lead to excessive inflation and an intensification of currency imbalances . schaeuble said he would not let germany 's opposition to the fed 's action get pushed to the back burner and that the issue would be addressed during the g20 summit in south korea next week . " i wish the americans every success in dealing with their big problems effectively and swiftly , " he said .
" but if they look at the successes that germany has had they will see that more and more deficits is not the way to do it . " europe 's largest economy , germany is enjoying a strong recovery from the global economic crisis and has resisted calls for scaling back its austerity measures and lowering taxes . europe 's central bank holds rate steady the fed 's billion-dollar injection also failed to convince the european central bank .
ecb president jean-claude trichet announced on thursday that the frankfurt-based bank would maintain its course of slowly shutting off the money supply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chef bernanke defended the move earlier , us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke defend the monetary course of his institution . " this approach eased financial conditions in the past and , so far , looks to be effective again , " he said . schaeuble hit back by saying that the fed measures to revive the us economy have failed . " they have already pumped an endless amount of money into the economy , " the german minister said .
" the results have been dismal . " schaeuble added that the job market continues to be difficult and as does the overall economic situation . " fed could cause long-term damage " schaeuble 's harsh assessment was supported by leading economists .
the fed runs the risk of causing long-term damage , said michael huether , director of the cologne-based institute for economic research -lrb- iw -rrb- .
the acquisition of government bonds by the fed is a fundamental regulative sin , he said , and it would do nothing to solve the structural problems in the us economy . german economic minister rainer bruederle also criticized the us central bank , saying that he would watch recent developments with great concern . internationally , the german politicians were joined by brazilian and chinese officials in their criticism of the us plan to buy government bonds . " everybody wants the us economy to recover , but it does no good at all to just throw dollars from a helicopter , " said brazilian finance minister guido mantega . the fed also announced wednesday that it would lower its key interest rate .
the world 's largest economy only had a growth rate of two percent in the third quarter of 2010 .

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .

" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "

in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .

the official report is to be published next week . croatia is poised to enter the final stage of talks to enter the european union , while turkey and other eu hopefuls still need to implement reforms , curb crime and protect press freedom , according to a draft report by the eu executive board that was leaked to reuters .
" negotiations with croatia have entered their final stage , " the commission said in the draft .
" however , efforts must continue and further intensify , in particular in the field of judicial reform . "
the report said that zagreb must still demonstrate that it has adopted eu standards on the rule of law and tackling corruption , as well as improve cooperation with the united nations war crimes tribunal for former yugoslavia .

turkey also earned praise for taking on an increasingly active role in foreign policy in the region .
persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .
the report said that while turkey " has continued to express public support " for un-run talks between greek and turkish cypriots , " there has been no progress towards normalization of bilateral relations " with cyprus .
women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .
the board 's annual progress report on expansion policy is due to be published on november 9 .

persisting problems but the divisive issue of eu-member cyprus , where turkish troops still occupy the northern part of the island , continued to be a sticking point in turkey 's accession .

women 's rights issues and the treatment of minorities were also mentioned as shortcomings .

but germany is hesitant to introduce a similar scheme , as lawmakers ca n't agree on the country 's needs . canada accepts an average of 250,000 legal immigrants each year .
for the canadian government , immigrants play a key role in maintaining the country 's economic well-being .
" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

" canada 's post-recession economy demands a high level of legal immigration to keep our work force strong , " immigration minister jason kenney said earlier this week as he presented the country 's annual immigration plan in parliament .
the plan estimates that canada will receive between 240,000 and 265,000 new permanent residents in 2011 .
sixty percent of these immigrants come through economic streams , mainly as part of the federal skilled worker program .
it gives priority to technicians , skilled tradespersons , managers and professionals who help supplement the canadian-born workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants from asia would like to settle in vancouver applicants are sorted according to a point system .
it awards a certain number of points for factors including education , language skills , work experience , age , or employment perspectives .
in addition , candidates must prove that they have enough money to support themselves and their family members after they arrive in canada .
a master 's degree or phd , for example , is awarded 25 points , whereas only a high-school education gets 5 points .
four years of full-time , paid work experience earns applicants 21 points , one year only 15 points .
altogether , a maximum of 100 points can be awarded .
the pass mark is 67 points for all factors combined .
then , applicants are qualified to apply for permanent resident status .
these applications are in turn compared to the occupation demands of the various provinces .
the remaining 40 percent of immigrants come to canada for humanitarian reasons , mainly refugees and asylum seekers , as well as family members of permanent residents .
in the case of the latter , authorities have determined that the relatives of qualified and employed immigrants often also have a good education and are highly motivated to integrate into their new home country .
canada has a population of some 34 million people .
australia and new zealand also use similar point-based systems .
can germany learn ?
debate about a point-based system of immigration has existed in germany for years .
however , it has been impossible to date for lawmakers across party lines to agree on such a scheme .
economics minister rainer bruederle has said a point-based system would be advantageous for germany .
it was flexible and allowed authorities to select applicants based on the country 's respective economic needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are thousands of jobs for qualified engineers that are open in germany and the clock is ticking .
business organizations such as the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- or the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- said germany lacked about 400,000 to 500,000 skilled workers .
" we are desperately dependent on qualified immigrants , " diw 's president , klaus zimmermann , said .
the lack of skilled workers could hamper europe 's biggest economy in getting back on its feet after last year 's recession .
the economics ministry estimated that the labor shortage was costing the german economy some 15 billion euros per year -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- .
in addition , the german population is shrinking - and growing numbers of germans are even emigrating , for example to countries like canada .
at the same time , qualified specialists from abroad would rather immigrate to denmark , the netherlands or britain .
if they do choose germany , they face a months-long bureaucratic ordeal to get their papers .
the expert council of german foundations on integration and migration -lrb- svr -rrb- said in its 2010 annual report that an immigration reform should be much more closely tied to the employment market instead of to human capital .
in germany , a point system such as canada 's would be linked to an ongoing analysis of profession shortages in the country .
if an applicant had a profession urgently required in germany , he would receive bonus points in the scheme .
an additional element would enable companies to directly hire highly qualified foreigners .
the council recommended employers would pay a set one-time fee in order to circumvent the point system and directly hire from abroad .
" only those employers that are really affected from an acute and serious shortage of labor will make use of this costly option , " the council said .
the fee would then be earmarked in a fund to further educate domestic workers .
but politicians continue to be unable to find common ground on the issue .
" the existing laws are flexible enough , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere in response to bruederle 's demands .
" employers who need skilled workers should go out in the world and recruit them - and then we 'll help them with the immigration .
the other way around wo n't work . "

but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 us must tackle human rights issues , says former un torture investigator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak , former un special rapporteur on torture in an interview with deutsche welle , the former un special rapporteur on torture lauds the obama administration for joining the un human rights council .
but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 05.11.2010 in berlin , life is still a cabaret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the roaring twenties were berlin 's cultural heyday , and gave the city its reputation as a hotbed of hedonism .
weimar-era decadence is once again all the rage , as the party crowd trades in hooded tops for feather boas . on one count , berlin has always disappointed me .
seeing bob fosse 's 1972 musical " cabaret " at an impressionable age was one of the main reasons i moved here : i came expecting to find the city depicted in fritz lang 's " dr. mabuse " films , complete with old ladies straight out of otto dix paintings smoking alone in cafes and pirate jenny from " the threepenny opera " lingering on street corners .
but i soon discovered that in 21st-century berlin , few traces remain of the wanton waywardness of weimar culture . but could the " divine decadence " so beloved by sally bowles be making a comeback ?
it seems it might , judging by the popularity of the " boheme sauvage " club nights .
taking place every few months , they 're organized by the society for elegant entertainment - founded by a certain fraeulein else edelstahl - and are billed as a night for " everyone for whom less is never more , and too much is never enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the master of ceremonies and his sidekick putting on the ritz one way or another , that could apply to most people who like going out in berlin .
but these parties are different .
they pull a crowd that looks like it 's spent the last seven decades in a time-warp , and berlin has no shortage of appropriate venues to accommodate them . even though the city is legendary for makeshift clubs in former industrial warehouses , it also knows how to do faded grandeur .
" boheme sauvage " can take its pick of nightspots that hark back to the decades when berlin was considered europe 's capital of arts and culture , from the wintergarten theater on potsdamer strasse to the gruener salon at the volksbuehne once run by max reinhardt , and the oxymoron in the historic art deco hackesche hoefe . all neo-baroque stairways and gilt-edged mirrors , the venue last weekend was the heimathafen neukoelln , a popular dance hall in the 1920s and a perfect backdrop for the evening 's frolics .
there 's a line outside tailing along karl marx strasse when i get there , and i see a few sheepish looking punters in jeans and anoraks sloping off down the road who 've obviously been turned away .
the dress code is strict , but most people are more than happy to stick to it - there are n't many places in berlin where you can wear your gladrags with pride , after all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresscode at boheme sauvage is taken very seriously but i 'm amazed how seriously everyone 's taking it .
most of the men have opted for tuxedos , monocles and slicked back hair , while the women are decked out in full flapper regalia , complete with drop-waist frocks , strings of pearls and finger wave bobs .
as they enter , everyone is given a stash of reichmarks they can blow at the casino upstairs , and the tipple of choice is - aber natuerlich - absinthe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 05.11.2010 us must tackle human rights issues , says former un torture investigator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred nowak , former un special rapporteur on torture in an interview with deutsche welle , the former un special rapporteur on torture lauds the obama administration for joining the un human rights council .
but he urges obama to deal with the legacy of his predecessor . manfred nowak served as un special rapporteur on torture from 2004 until october 2010 .
he is the director of the ludwig boltzmann institute of human rights in vienna and a professor for international human rights protection at the university of vienna .
from 1996-2003 , nowak was a judge at the human rights chamber in bosnia .
deutsche welle : last year president barack obama reversed his predecessor 's decision not to join the un human rights council and on friday the council reviewed the us for the first time .
was obama right to join the group ?
manfred nowak : i certainly welcome very much that the us joined the human rights council .
it is the most important political body of the united nations dealing with human rights and it is important that all the major member of the security council are also members of the human rights council .
there are also some positive developments which the us brought into the policy making of the human rights council .
in its required report prior to the council 's review , the us admitted problems with discrimination and immigration .
what are the other human rights issues involving the us ?
first of all , the us has a very bad reputation in ratifying un and other human rights treaties and accepting monitoring procedures .
it 's one out of two countries in the world which has not yet ratified on the rights of the child , similarly the convention on the elimination of discrimination against women , the covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , even the inter-american convention on human rights .
there is no individual complaints procedure .
no us person can ever bring a complaint to an international body whether within the united nations or the inter-american court of human rights .
it has not accepted the statute of the international criminal court and that is of course a matter of major concern .
another big concern is of course capital punishment .
the death penalty is still fairly widely practiced in 35 states and in the federal jurisdiction and the general assembly of the united nations issued a strong appeal to all states to at least take action for a moratorium with the final aim of abolishing the death penalty .
a further concern is the prison system .
of the roughly 10 million prisoners worldwide more than 2 million are in the us because of a very punitive and retributive way of criminal justice .
the prisons are overcrowded and the conditions in maximum security prisons are very very strict .
they have shackles and other forms of restraints that are inhuman .
and then we have the whole issue of the legacy of the bush administration and their so-called war on terror .
we have just heard from the wikileaks documentation that the us knowingly practiced torture in iraq , handing over detainees to the iraqi securities forces .
they have not closed down guantanamo and the obama administration has not brought a single individual whether a cia officer , military or the political persons responsible for the practice of torture to accountability before a criminal court .
not a single victim has received any form of compensation which of course is a continuing violation of the obligations of the united states under the convention against torture .
the obama administration has vowed to close the cia 's secret prisons and to stop using harsh interrogation methods , but it has not repudiated so-called renditions , that is the abduction and transfer of prisoners to other countries , but has insisted it wo n't transfer prisoners to countries where they might be tortured .
as former un special rapporteur on torture , how do you rate the obama administration 's performance on torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners ?
i think we have to distinguish two issues .
one is change and obama promised and i think he kept his promise to a large extent to not continue any longer with the practice of secret detentions , the practice of torture , the practice of rendition flights .
really rendition flights in the sense of sending a person to another country in order to be tortured .
that was the very person of the extraordinary rendition flights by the cia under the bush administration .
but the second issue is that the obama administration is under an international obligation to deal with the past .
and obama closed his eyes and said i do n't want to look into the past .
he should have immediately established a comprehensive investigation appointing a blue ribbon commission or a special investigator to first investigate what really happened .
now wikileaks in relation to afghanistan and iraq has shown some evidence , but there is much more .
where were the secret detention places ?
what kind of methods have been used in order to torture the detainees ?
that all needs first to be established and on the basis of such an independent investigation there are two obligations .
one is to hold the perpetrators accountable .
this is an obligation under criminal law under the torture convention and that means also those who ordered it whether it is the -lrb- former -rrb- defense secretary donald rumsfeld or others .
that depends on the outcome of the investigation .
if you have enough evidence , you have to bring them to justice .
and second , of course the victims of torture and renditions have an internationally recognized right to an adequate remedy and reparation .
that means at least compensation or for torture victims rehabilitation .
in other states that cooperated with the us some victims received compensation .
in the us , even the obama administration is still invoking the state secrecy privilege in order to block civil litigation by victims .
last year you called on the obama administration to prosecute george w. bush and donald rumsfeld for permitting torture to take place .
are you disappointed that it has n't happened and probably wo n't ever happen ?
of course it 's a political issue as well .
but from a legal point of view , there 's an obligation .
i am not calling really for particular individuals .
what i am saying is first we need the truth .
and then it is up to the independent judicial bodies of the us , judges and prosecutors , to take the necessary action .
if all the evidence is on the table , for instance in relation to john yoo and jay bybee -lrb- legal counsellors to george w. bush - ed . -rrb- and others who issued these torture memos which were used as a justification of torture by alberto gonzales -lrb- attorney general under bush - ed . -rrb- and the bush administration in general .
this is complicity in torture .
we know what kind of interrogation methods donald rumsfeld clearly ordered to be applied in guantanamo bay and he was warned by alberto mora -lrb- general counsel of the navy under bush - ed . -rrb- and others , his closest legal advisers , that what you are ordering is torture .
so he knew it and nevertheless he did it .
now that is clear evidence and in our guantanamo report already in 2006 we have stated that evidence .
there must be criminal accountability according to the law .
i have a certain understanding that president obama did not want immediately to really get into such a conflict with the republicans and the former government .
but a thorough investigation would be the least that is required from a new president who really campaigned for change and a new ethical behavior in international relations and toward people under his jurisdiction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 05.11.2010 with schalke mired in crisis , magath is on borrowed time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as schalke plumb the depths , magath feels the pressure second from bottom , 19 points behind bitter rivals and bundesliga leaders dortmund , one victory and six defeats : the story of schalke 's season to date is a woeful one .
it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "

it makes desperate reading for coach felix magath . on the face of things , it seems disrespectful to talk about felix magath potentially losing his job over schalke 's disastrous start to the bundesliga season .
but such is the climate of modern soccer that any coach , regardless of record and reputation , is fair game in the sack race if he does n't deliver the goods .
the mounting pressure that comes with a relegation battle is the surest indication a coach can have that the buck stops with him .
underperforming players may get dropped , even sold in the transfer window , but none of them will be sacked .
the same can not be said for the coach .
a coach sends out his team every week in the knowledge that he is only as good as the result the men he puts on the field can achieve .
looking at schalke 's season to date , it looks as though felix magath is not good enough .
this in itself may seem a harsh assessment considering who we 're talking about .
magath won back-to-back doubles with bayern munich , dominating the bundesliga and german cup competitions between 2004 and 2006 .
he also took bayern to two champions league quarter-finals in the three seasons he was in charge - seasons in which the bavarian giants were struggling to compete financially with other so-called european giants .
perhaps his greatest managerial feat , however , was leading wolfsburg to the league title in his second season at the unfashionable club after being jettisoned from bayern in 2007 .
magath 's departure from bayern - for failing to get the club higher than fourth even though there was still five months of the season remaining - is not the only time he has been sacked .
he was fired from his first coaching job at hamburg , his alma mater , way back in 1997 , and again in frankfurt in 2001 .
but more often he has left his coaching posts on his own terms and at his own behest .
still , coming off an unlucky loss to leverkusen and a limp draw in tel aviv , one feels that should schalke lose another game or two , magath could either be put to the sword or choose to fall on it .
high expectations weigh heavy on schalke 's coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were looking up for magath after his first season if the schalke hierarchy choose to wield the axe at this early juncture of the season , it would suggest that they got it badly wrong when they appointed magath in the summer of 2009 , despite the fact that he led the club to second-place finish in his debut season , returning schalke to the champions league in the process .
" the hierarchy made a great choice in getting magath to schalke , " shane kapral , who covers schalke for the offside.com , told deutsche welle .
" the club was an absolute mess after the 2008/2009 season and could never have envisioned a second place finish and nearly winning the league .
he succeeded well at the start because he is respected by players , his teams are always the fittest , he teaches discipline and organization , and he knows how to discover young , talented players . "
this season has been different .
since magath was installed to bring the holy grail to schalke , their first german title since 1958 , it bodes ill that this looks as far away from happening as it ever has in the preceding 52 years .
maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

maybe last season 's performances led expectations to rise too high and that the club 's hierarchy started to see echoes of wolfsburg 's sudden elevation in the club 's fortunes .
maybe magath , the short-term thinker and trouble-shooter , simply bit off more than he could chew .
as a coach , he has come into most of his jobs with a smash-and-grab mentality .
he has planned shock-and-awe campaigns rather than long-term strategies for success and consolidation .
once wolfsburg had been battered into championship winning shape , his job was done .
he was never going to create a legacy there .
armin veh and now steve mcclaren can attest to that .
long-term project a new prospect for quick-fix magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath led wolfsburg to the title in his second season " anyone who looks at magath 's career will see that he is not the man for longer projects , " schalke expert and sometime sportschau.de correspondent marcus bark told deutsche welle .
" his brand of tough man-management only works for a short - albeit often successful - amount of time . "
schalke may have looked like another vehicle primed and ready to be driven at breakneck speed towards another title , but this season has shown that while adding a raul here and a huntelaar there , it 's still an old banger under the glossy paint job .
magath has looked powerless to stop the wheels coming off as his team has spluttered to the hard shoulder .
to be fair it ca n't help that , with the club some 250 million-euros in the red , magath was told to slash the wage bill this summer - while at the same time attempting to build a team capable of fighting on domestic and european fronts .
the management may be to blame for the financial aspect of this problem but magath was the one who sold the best defense in the league last year , offloading heiko westermann , marcelo bordon and rafinha while bringing in the washed-up christoph metzelder to help marshal their understudies .
he also showed kevin kurayni and his steady haul of around 15 goals a season the door , bringing in the over-rated ac milan and real madrid reject klaas-jan huntelaar and the aging raul to replace him - two transfers , it must be said , which ate up all the profit he made from sales and then some .
depleted defense and non-firing strike force add to problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul was a marquee signing but was he a pertinent one ?
" magath took a big risk in changing his squad so radically , " thiemo mueller , kicker magazine 's schalke beat writer , told deutsche welle .
" he urgently wanted a better attack , which is why he bought raul , huntelaar and jurado .
but raul has n't been able to fulfill the expectations until now .
he is not the focus of the attack as magath claimed he would be . "
or perhaps , said mueller , raul is just too old to adapt physically to the bundesliga .
" in many games it has seemed like this . "
" the club and fans have given him everything , " said theoffside.com 's kapral .
" they approved a transfer budget that was very aggressive and gave him the funds he asked for . "
magath ’ s mistake , said kapral , was to replace the majority of his defense when he didn ’ t need to .
in so doing , he broke up the best part of the team .
" there was no reason to let westermann , bordon and rafinha leave .
perhaps he could let one go , but no way should he have sent all three away . "
magath has also had bad luck with injuries , but even those mistakes belie bad judgment , said kapral .
" at full-back , he made a huge error in believing hoogland would be healthy for the start of the season and he was overly optimistic to think that christian pander could get fit . "
pander has missed the better part of the last two seasons with recurring injuries .
it has n't just been the transfers though , kapral added - magath has also made a lot of bizarre line-up decisions and substitutions .
perhaps the most befuddling was taking off jurado in the 60th minute against frankfurt last week .
" no schalke fan could understand what he was thinking . "
future looks bleak but sacking is not a foregone conclusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will magath be waving goodbye to schalke sometime soon ?
just as it rings true that no club is too good to go down , it also appears that no coach is too good to be sacked .
success and silverware are always things of the past for a coach .
they are men who are judged on the here and now .
and felix magath 's present reality is a dark one .
" schalke as a club is all about the fans , " kapral concluded .
" if the fans turn on magath then he will not be around long . "
but kicker 's thiemo mueller believes it may end up being more complicated than that .
" magath 's job is still quite safe , " he said .
" first of all , magath still has a certain amount of credit because of his surprising success with schalke last season and because of his success with former clubs wolfsburg , bayern and stuttgart .
no one can have any doubts , that magath is one of germany 's top coaches .
his position is even stronger because of his status as coach , manager and member of the board of club directors . "
more tellingly , said mueller , if he was sacked , schalke would have to pay the wages due to magath and his assistant coaches - about 10 million euro per year , all told - until summer 2013 .
" this seems nearly impossible for the club , especially in the context of the level of debt that needs to be serviced , the cash needed to hire a new coach , and the fact there could be no income from european competition next season . "
in other words , schalke may want to fire magath … but they probably can ’ t afford it .

6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .

5 schalke - st. pauli st. pauli are on the slide , which is a shame because their early season form suggested that they were made of sterner stuff .
after losing to stuttgart two weeks ago , the proverbial stuffing seems to have been knocked out of them - as was evident in the 3-1 home reverse to frankfurt last week .

the veltins arena is no longer a fortress and pauli may come to gelsenkirchen fancying their chances of arresting their descent and claiming a big scalp .
if they come away with the spoils , do n't be surprised to see magath down the job centre come monday .

6 hamburg - hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have found the going tough at times this season are hamburg in crisis ?
any other team with talent like hsv 's who perform as erratically as them would certainly consider themselves to have problems .
but this seems to be par for the course for the red-shorts over the past few years , so it may not be a crisis but more of a terminal case of dry rot .
something needs to change even if they beat hoffenheim this week - which they wo n't .
the hoff may still be far off the pace in terms of a title push , but the 4-0 thumping of hannover showed what they 're capable of when in the mood .
hsv 's defeat to cologne will have stung , but not enough to prevent the hoff coming to town and leaving with the points .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 frankfurt - wolfsburg has he or has n't he ?
got it right , that is .
one week steve mcclaren looks to have got a grasp of the bundesliga , his team tactics and his players ' strengths , the next it looks like he has n't got the foggiest .
two weeks ago , steve 's boys looked like sheep in wolves ’ clothing .
last week they showed their fangs before chewing up a recovering stuttgart team up and spitting them out .
which wolfsburg team turns up at frankfurt is anyone 's guess , but it 'll need to be a confident one .
eintracht have their own tails up and have climbed to fifth after going five games unbeaten .
the chances are high that they 'll extend this to six and start worrying the champions league positions .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 moechengladbach - bayern bayern 's ominously clinical victory over freiburg last week showed signs of a team which had rediscovered their mojo .
up to seventh now - but still ten points off the summit - the german champions will need to keep stoking the fires to get up the necessary head of steam to charge towards first place in the coming weeks .
what better time to play gladbach , who are in freefall ?
or at least they were , until they hit rock bottom last week .
bayern should continue their climb with their first away win since september - and in so doing , teach gladbach that their nightmare is not yet over .
prediction : bayern 3-0 freiburg - mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach tuchel has tasted defeat just twice so far it 's unlikely that the 2-0 home defeat to dortmund last week will lead to mainz imploding .
thomas tuchel 's team has too much character for that .
it will have been a kick in the teeth though , which will make mainz an even more dangerous proposition for freiburg .
bayern thumped the breisgauers last weekend and a wounded mainz team may do the same if coach robin dutt does n't get his players into the right head space .
mainz have only lost two games so far this season and won all the rest so if they do travel south looking for revenge , the chances are high that freiburg will get mauled .
prediction : mainz 3-0 nuremberg - cologne cologne clawed their way out of the relegation zone last week with their shock win over hamburg .
it was a shock because it was only their second victory of the season and in most of their matches so far , they 've looked dire .
werder bremen aside , no-one has really given cologne the spanking they deserve yet and that 's because of their stifling tactics which limits the opposition 's - and their own - creativity .
new coach frank schaefer seems ready to instill a more positive ethic in the team , but old habits die hard .
plus nuremberg are no slouches themselves in the department of defense .
prediction : nuremberg 1-0 sunday , nov 7 hannover - dortmund dortmund are now unbeaten in the league since their opening day defeat at home to bayer leverkusen .
what 's most impressive is that they 've already beaten a string of teams that traditionally finish ahead of them in the bundesliga , which is the kind of form a team needs to be crowned champions .
there 's a long way to go before they can consider that possibility but another win against hannover on sunday will at least keep their grip on top spot .
hannover will be more than satisfied with their league form to date , but they 've been losing to the big teams - and this season dortmund are definitely one of those .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 leverkusen - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen have been steadily accumulating points compared to the sounding of trumpets which accompanied their early-season good form last year , leverkusen are playing it cool this season , quietly rising up the league with only two defeats to their name so far .
in fact , this year ’ s group of pharmaceuticals seem to be relishing the few headlines they are making , aided by the fact that media flytrap michael ballack is still out injured .
kaiserslautern enjoyed a comfortable win over gladbach last week - but then , so have most teams .
leverkusen away will be a different proposition - just do n't expect any fanfare .
prediction : leverkusen 1-0 stuttgart - bremen torsten frings has accused his bremen team mates of lacking a killer instinct .
it was certainly missing in the 3-2 home defeat to nuremberg last week .
bremen have now lost four games in the league this season , and there are clearly problems in all areas of the team , from a shaky backline to ponderous midfielders and misfiring strikers .
rollercoaster results are not a new thing at bremen , but this inconsistency is costing them in a campaign where the traditional hierarchy has been shaken up .
bremen could be taking advantage , but they 're not .
stuttgart could too , if they do n't let jens keller 's early good work go to waste .
the new coach was powerless to avoid his first defeat in charge last week but bremen 's visit gives him the opportunity to show his mettle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 05.11.2010 eu eyes tougher regulation for credit rating agencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit rating agencies got blamed for the financial crisis the eu called for additional rules to curb ratings agencies , a sector much criticized in the wake of the financial crisis .
new eu regulation goes into effect on jan .
1 , but some say it 's not enough . the european commission wants tighter control on credit agencies in the future that would increase transparency , prevent conflicts of interest and widen competition in a sector dominated by three big players , two of which are american . the commission , the eu 's executive , released a set of proposals on friday that lay out several concrete steps europe might take to try to curb rating agencies ' influence and improve the quality of their ratings , above and beyond the new rules already adopted that put the industry under increased supervision . the industry is now dominated by moody 's , standard and poor 's and fitch , which together have 92 percent of the market .
in fact , the two american firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's , together have a market share of more than 80 percent .
fitch has headquarters in both london and new york . the companies found themselves firmly in the line of fire after the mortgage meltdown in the united states and the resulting global financial crisis .
they were blamed for failing to spot bad credit on company balance sheets and castigated for giving high ratings to securities which later turned out to be toxic . " the financial crisis did expose a number of problems with ratings agencies , including major conflicts of interest , " philip whyte , a senior research fellow at the centre for european reform , told deutsche welle .
" the people that were paying credit rating agencies were the same people whose securities were being rated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agencies ' quick demotion of greece to " junk " status hurt attempts at a rescue " there 's also been a certain amount of disquiet about the power that ratings agencies have , " he added . the anger was reignited when sudden downgrades of greek sovereign debt pushed that country 's borrowing costs into the stratosphere and had other eu nations scrambling to put together a bailout and bolster a tumbling euro . new regulation before the greece meltdown , the eu had already begun working on new oversight , having passed regulatory measures in 2008 . the regulation , adopted in 2009 and to go into effect on jan .
1 , mandates that credit rating agencies be registered and subjected to ongoing supervision , sets new rules on governance , operations and business conduct , and requires that agencies disclose potential conflicts of interest along with their methodologies . while the regulation is seen by many as a positive step , others do not feel it goes far enough nor addresses some of the fundamental problems with credit ratings , namely that lack of competition and the conflict of interest inherent in the current issuer-pays model . " rating agencies pose a multitude of regulatory problems , none of which can be solved easily , " karel lannoo , ceo of the centre for european policy studies , wrote in a study of the new regulation last month .
" a more fundamental review is needed of the business model . " the eu commission is taking that advice to heart .
suggestions for further regulation include requiring that agencies give countries several days ' warning before issuing a sovereign-debt rating and make their research reports freely available to investors . other ideas include introducing a liability regime for rating agencies at the eu level .
such civil liability for agencies was recently introduced in the united states . the proposals are contained in a consultation document and agencies and others will be given two months to respond . eu rating agency ? bildunterschrift : some analysts say a european agency would be a counterbalance to the big three eu internal market commissioner michel barnier floated the idea earlier this year of creating an eu credit rating agency , a public body which would increase competition , perhaps specialize in sovereign debt and serve as a counterweight to the big us firms , moody 's and standard and poor 's .
such an idea is especially favored by barnier 's home country , france . " there are not enough ratings agencies , not enough competition and not enough diversity , " barnier said in may .
" why should there not be an agency that is more european than those that exist today ? " according to philip whyte , that represents an aversion shared by some in continental europe to the fact that the big three agencies are all from the anglo-saxon world and might have a certain prejudice toward continental european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnier has suggested created an eu-level rating agency " but markets might not give ratings coming from a european credit rating agency the same sort of credibility if it is just seen as a cosmetic exercise to cover up problems in countries like greece and spain , " he said . analyst lannoo shares that opinion .
he said proving that such an agency was independent and not subject to political pressure would be difficult .
then there is the question of financing it and establishing a track record . " it depends so much on reputation , " lannoo told deutsche welle .
" if the european central bank works to establish an agency , it would at least take three or four years before it would have any kind of reputation or authority in the market . " increasing competition is also seen as a necessity in the ratings industry , and while the new licensing requirements already in place in the eu might make it harder for new players to enter the market , many want to try .
in september , 27 companies requested licenses , according to lannoo . spotty history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies did n't see the dot.com bust coming either while the debate over credit rating agencies has reached a new volume , questions about their role and responsibilities pre-date the financial crisis . chastised , the tarnished sector is no longer as resistant to regulation as it once was .
the financial sector sees the industry in a different way as well , according to whyte . " the big lesson of the crisis is you ca n't be too reliant on credit rating agencies , " he said .
" now banks and regulators see ratings from agencies as just one of the factors that come into an assessment of risk . " author : kyle james editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as lars bevanger reports in his postcard from manchester , the topic is dynamite in the uk . an mep for the anti-eu uk independence party once told me voting was a privilege extended to good citizens , and that prisoners must lose that privilege .
he also called the european court of human rights " brand new " , while pointing out that britain 's constitutional democracy was over 600 years old .
the uk was right , he said , in banning prisoners from voting , and the european court was wrong when it said it must be allowed .
well , this week the uk government gave that mep more ammunition by deciding that the european court of human rights was right when it ruled - more than five years ago - that the uk 's ban on prisoners ' votes was in breach of eu law .
but there are many here who agree with the mep .
there is a sizeable minority who feel prisoners get treated better than many of the country 's poorer , law-abiding citizens .
a recent tabloid headline illustrates the point : " minister says inmates should have choice of five dishes for dinner " .
i mean - heaven forbid prisoners get a choice between meatballs and fish .
uk politicians have played politics with crime and punishment for so long that the prison population - a record 85,000 people this year - in many people 's eyes have turned into sub-humans not worthy of human rights .
crime and punishment take john hirst .
he killed his landlady with an axe and spent 25 years in jail .
why should he be allowed to vote while on the inside ?
well he clearly thought he should , and when he got out he was a self-taught legal expert and took the government to court for failing to allow prisoners the vote .
he won .
it was his victory nearly six years ago which has now finally forced the british government to fall into line with most other european countries and allow prisoners to vote .
john hirst 's crime was horrible , and he was rightly sent to jail for it .
but , as he pointed out to me when i met him earlier this year , his punishment was to be locked up - nothing more , nothing less .
you could argue till you 're blue in the face about the morality of allowing someone who has deprived another person of their very life to have a say in how society is run .
but as long as the letter of the law says that is irrelevant , it is irrelevant .
when you live in a democracy with an independent judiciary , you 're not going to like everything that comes from it .
some people object to paying tax .
some want to smoke marijuana .
but you do or you do n't , because it 's the law .
people in prison do n't lose all their rights as human beings , the law does n't allow it .
what they lose is their freedom .
those close to the conservative prime minister david cameron said he was " absolutely horrified " by the idea of changing the law to allow prisoners the vote .
whether this is his personal opinion i do not know , but it 's not a surprising thing to come from any politician here .
criminals in the uk are not vote winners .
early on in his labour party leadership , tony blair coined the phrase " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime . "
many prisoner interest groups now point out the causes of crime are often to be found in the alienation prisoners feel when they are denied basic rights such as being able to vote .
and who knows , with 85,000 people in jail , their vote could actually change a thing or two in the next election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 05.11.2010 kosovo struggles to gain international recognition online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even though kosovo is free , it lacks a country code even though facebook has finally located pristina in kosovo , the newfound country still lacks a telephone country code and its own top-level domain name , and that may take some time to rectify . kosovo has hit a new milestone in its quest for recognition .
last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .
these letters affixed to web addresses serve as electronic flags .
brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

european countries joined appeals for a halt to the death penalty . the us delegation also heard demands for an end to discrimination against minorities and immigrants and defended its human rights record from criticism from foes including cuba and iran .
the debate took place in the united nations human rights council , which is gradually reviewing the performance of all 192 un member states .
" while we are proud of our achievements , we are not satisfied with the status quo .
we will continue to work to ensure that our laws are fair and justly implemented , " michael posner , assistant us secretary of state for democracy , human rights and labor , told the geneva forum .
" let there be no doubt , the united states does not and will not torture , " state department legal adviser harold koh told the council .
" this administration began by turning the page and unequivocally ensuring the humane treatment of all individuals in us custody in armed conflict , " he insisted .
long line of speakers but diplomats from countries at odds with washington - some of whom queued overnight to be among the first on the speakers ' list - hammered the us delegation for alleged abuses .
cuban ambassador rodolfo reyes rodriguez spoke first , calling on washington to end the blockade on his island country and respect the cuban people 's right to self-determination .
venezuela 's envoy german mundarain hernandez said it should " close guantanamo and secret detention centers around the world , punish those people who torture , disappear and execute detainees arbitrarily and provide compensation to victims . "

the almost yearly shipment to gorleben has become a focus for german anti-nuclear activism . a shipment of reprocessed atomic waste is back on the move after anti-nuclear activists blocked its journey from a french reprocessing plant to a storage site in northern germany .
protesters brought the train to a halt close to the main railway station in caen , normandy , soon after it left the town of valognes on friday afternoon .
a police spokesman told the dpa news agency that protesters had chained themselves to the railway track , with about 30 activists taking part at the scene .
the agency later reported that five protesters who had been uncoupled from the track were taken into custody .
the train was delayed for about three hours .
some 150 protesters nearby had unfurled a banner in german , declaring " our resistance knows no borders . "
up to 30,000 protesters were expected to gather at the end of the route being taken by the reduced-speed nuclear waste transport to the site in gorleben in lower saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have been preparing for weeks some of those activists were expected to try to occupy railway tracks and obstruct roads in the town of dannenberg , where the waste was due to arrive over the weekend to be transported by truck to gorleben , 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- away . riot police accompany shipment the shipment consists of 123 metric tons of treated waste in 11 carriages - originally from german power stations - and was being accompanied by three carriages of riot police . german green party co-leader claudia roth said that members of her party would be taking part in the protests , but warned against violent action .
" any form of violence weakens the peaceful and legitimate protest and discredits it , " she told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau 's friday edition . roth added that the greens did not support an internet-based campaign for protesters to stop the transport by removing stones from beneath rails . more than 16,000 police officers were being deployed to ensure that the transport reaches its destination safely .
shipments take place almost every year and , in the past , protesters have also attempted to delay the shipment by a number of means - including blocking the route with tractors , holding sit-down demonstrations and throwing fireworks . heightened protests expected police say this year 's protests are likely to receive increased impetus because of recent large-scale demonstrations in stuttgart against the reconstruction of the city 's main railway station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party co-leader roth said that the party was supporting peaceful protest the deputy president of the german police union , bernhard witthaut , told the newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten that police would not try to " beat a way through " for the transport , but that they did have the duty of ensuring its security . witthaut also warned against violence , saying the police had a duty to protect themselves .

he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that it was not acceptable for taxpayers to foot the full bill in view of the billions of euros in profit made by the industry .

controversial storage site the temporary storage site in the lower saxony town of gorleben is itself controversial , with critics saying there is a danger of ground water contamination .
protesters are also angry at the recent decision by chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition government to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear plants by an average of 12 years , overturning a decision by an earlier government to phase out atomic plants by 2021 .
they say this means more nuclear waste is going to be produced without there being a safe repository for it .

last month , facebook began acknowledging the tiny balkan nation 's fledgling statehood .
the social networking giant now identifies users in the capital , pristina , as being in kosovo .
facebook chalked it up to a routine systems update .
the result : pristina is now properly located in kosovo , instead of bosnia-herzegovina .
it 's a bit of a mystery why facebook thought kosovo 's capital was in bosnia , which does n't even share a border with kosovo .
" it is significant in a way , symbolic .
i think it 's a small victory for a very large war - let 's call it a war - to change all the websites on the internet , " said fisnik ismaili , creative director of the ad agency olgilvy kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
olgilvy devised the most prominent symbol of kosovo 's statehood , the large yellow sculpture in central pristina that spells " newborn . "
it was the focal point of celebrations after the former serbian province declared independence in february 2008 .
seventy-one countries have recognized kosovo since then , and in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration did not violate international law .
not one , but three telephone country codes but so far it has n't been enough for kosovo to achieve a different kind of sovereignty - its own dialing code and top-level domain .
" it 's problematic , " said alban kastrati , the spokesperson for ipko , kosovo 's second largest mobile phone provider , which also provides broadband internet , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling a mobile phone in kosovo actually requires calling slovenia , monaco or serbia " we are a state – a sovereign state recognized by the most impactful countries .
we would like to have more elements that identify kosovo as a state . "
nearly all countries around the world are identified with a telephone country code .
germany has + 49 , canada has + 1 - and even greenland , which is still part of denmark , has + 299 .
kosovo , however , does n't have its own unique country code .
instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .
these letters affixed to web addresses serve as electronic flags .
brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

instead , kosovo has three codes : + 386 from slovenia , + 377 from monaco , and + 381 from serbia .
all those numbers are considered local within kosovo .
an ipko user with a slovenian code need not enter monaco 's code to call a subscriber with the state-run vala , the largest provider .
still , all of this means that numbers can not be ported - or moved - to different providers .
local operators also must pay fees to the foreign carriers that hold the numbers .
ultimately this telephone smorgasbord is bad for consumers , said agaim kukaj , director of information and communication technologies for the republic of kosovo .
" operators are suffering , " kukaj added .
" they have to pay higher costs .
these costs are often transferred to consumers .
instead of investing in infrastructure or lowering the prices of services , they have to pay money for things other operators in the world are not paying . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international corporation for assigned names and numbers must approve kosovo 's top-level domain name no top-level domain and if not having a phone code was n't bad enough , kosovo lacks another digital pillar of a sovereign state : a top-level domain .
these letters affixed to web addresses serve as electronic flags .
brazil has .br , the united kingdom has .uk , and even the palestinian territories have one - .ps.
but kosovo has n't even applied for its .ks because officials have been assured that it would be rejected .
it turns out that obtaining one , as well as a country code , requires some international diplomacy .
kosovo must apply to the international corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- for domains and the international telecommunications union for a country code .
these organizations generally look to the united nations for answers , which is a problem because kosovo does n't have un membership and most importantly is n't included in its statistical database as a country or area .
this makes the process much rockier because countries that remain opposed to kosovo 's impendence can more easily obstruct kosovo , kukaj added .
" all these obstacles are coming from countries which did n't recognize our country - especially these big and influential countries like russia and china , " he said .
" we know these obstacles , but still we are all the time we are trying to find small doors and enter into these small doors . "
e-commerce sites still do n't recognize kosovo previously , kosovo unsuccessfully applied for a country code while it was a un-administered province of serbia .
but now that kosovo has declared independence and is a member of both the international monetary fund and world bank , officials are increasingly hopeful that they stand a good chance of securing a top-level domain and telephone country code in the next year or two .
still , it 's far from certain when or even if kosovo will get a domain or country code .
that 's not stopping kosovo from establishing an electronic state .
plans are under way to a build an internet exchange point .
once it 's completed , domestic traffic will stay in kosovo instead of having to take a circuitous route around europe .
meanwhile , much of the internet has yet to acknowledge kosovo as a country .
google directs users to its serbian page , and online ordering can be a crapshoot since many sites do not provide an option for a kosovo address .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars hope that other websites will follow facebook 's example but facebook 's acknowledgement of kosovo 's statehood might have a domino effect , said martin waehlisch , an international law specialist , and the co-author of a new friedrich ebert foundation report about the public diplomacy of kosovo .
" i hope that this example could serve as an idea for other websites , " waehlisch said , who argues that individual users can have a big impact in persuading websites to recognize kosovo , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's so simple , and it could change the perception of people abroad who know little about kosovo .
when they type it in they always see that it is a country , it is independent , and it has a flag . "

but the country 's rulers have taken steps to curb democratic participation in areas dominated by ethnic minorities . with myanmar 's main opposition party - the national league for democracy - boycotting the country 's elections , candidates representing ethnic minority communities are poised to play a more significant role in this weekend 's vote .
most ethnic parties have only registered candidates for regional votes in burma - or myanmar , as it was renamed by the junta in 1989 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nld leader aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest yet election authorities moved to cancel elections in key border regions , which are dominated by minority communities and have seen repeated clashes between pro-military forces and ethnic armies .
a spokesperson for the burmese government in exile in thailand said the military claimed it was not possible to guarantee free and fair elections in those areas .
" in five ethnic states - the military junta said they will not hold elections there , " said zin linn , a government-in-exile spokesperson .
those areas are home to more than 3,000 villages , he said , with a combined population of nearly two million .
about one-third of the 53 million people living in myanmar belong to ethnic minorities , whose communities are concentrated in border regions .
linn added that the regime delayed registration of minority parties and canceled voting there because pro-junta candidates had little chance of winning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of minority communities have fled pro-military forces an uphill battle along myanmar 's border with bangladesh , the chin progressive party , which represents the chin people , is standing in regional elections .
while party head no than kap was confident he would win the most votes in his region , he said the odds were stacked against opposition parties in the national vote .
" if we had enough money , -lrb- opposition parties -rrb- could contest almost 1,000 seats , " he said .
even the largest opposition party to stand in the elections , the national democratic force , is only running in some 150 districts - whereas no than kap said pro-junta candidates could easily seek election , in some cases unopposed .
sunday 's elections are myanmar 's first in 20 years .
in 1990 , the national league for democracy won the first elections in three decades , but the military regime refused to honor their victory .
the party 's leader , aung san suu kyi , has been kept under house arrest - and this year , the nld is boycotting the vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar 's government refused to honor the results of the last elections 20 years ago meanwhile , some claim things would only get worse after the votes are counted .
" if you really go and meet with the communities on the different borders in china , india , bangladesh and thailand and ask them what they really think , they will express one common thing , " said zipporah sein , general-secretary of the karen national union .
" they are very worried of further exacerbation of the oppression and persecution and atrocities against their communities in the lead-up to the elections , and even worse after the elections . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ndf is standing in myanmar 's elections on sunday unable to vote even in areas where ethnic minority parties enjoy popular backing , dissidents and opposition members in exile say many members of minority communities are unable to vote .
these exiled members said some ca n't make it to the ballot box because they live in remote areas , while others are on the run from pro-military forces .
in addition , they noted that many ethnic minority members do not have personal identification - meaning they are ineligible to vote .
zin linn added that this is a common problem : " to get an id , they have to pay a lot of money , because corruption is everywhere . "
though linn predicted that some ethnic minority candidates would gain seats in the national parliament , he claimed it was only to create the illusion of democracy in myanmar .
