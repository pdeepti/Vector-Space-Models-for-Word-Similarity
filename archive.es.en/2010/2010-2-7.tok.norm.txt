" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests . " i have to say that this new doctrine does not reflect the real world , " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the conference .
" nato is not an enemy of russia , " the western alliance froze ties with moscow in 2008 over russia 's intervention in georgia .
but since then , nato has gradually resumed formal contacts .
" i think russia and we share the same interests in success in afghanistan , " rasmussen said .
mending fences visiting moscow in december , rasmussen had rebuffed the kremlin 's call for new defense arrangements in europe , saying he saw no need for a new security treaty as proposed by russia .
medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "
nato countries reacted skeptically , seeing the russian plan as an attempt to divide the alliance and saying that the existing organization for security and cooperation in europe was the right place to discuss security issues. nt / reuters / dpa / editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "
fuel exchange last year the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran .
the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home - a process world powers fear is designed to produce a nuclear bomb .

on friday , mottaki said that that was true , but that iran wanted to change some of the details .
on saturday , the european union 's new foreign-policy director , catherine ashton , said that she welcomed the fact that mottaki had decided at the last minute to come to munich .
but she stressed that the iaea plan and overtures conducted by the us administration " have so far gone without adequate response , " warning the iranian regime that " dialogue takes two . "
the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- insisited that iran had brought nothing to the negotiating tabel . " there was not a new proposal , " iaea chief yukiya amano said shortly after a meeting with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on the sidelines of the munich security conference . threat of military action us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in a panel discussion at the conference that world leaders needed to be clear with iran about what is expected of it . " we have n't been clear to this day .
everyone has been running around beating their chest saying iran , you ca n't have a nuclear weapon .
but we have n't been clear . " i think that 's a very waffly way to be trying to control something as serious as this . " fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said . " they should just accept the existing -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposal , " lieberman told dpa .
capital punishment meanwhile , iran rejected european union demands for a halt to the execution of opposition demonstrators .
iran 's foreign minister said during a debate with swedish foreign minister carl bildt that iranians condemned to death in the wake of last year 's disputed election and subsequent unrest were “ criminals . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arash rahmanipour und mohammadreza alizamani were exectued last month mottaki told an audience at the conference that a “ few people ” had burned houses and buses last year .
“ when crime happens , that is not protest , ” he said .
bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "
fuel exchange last year the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran .
the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home - a process world powers fear is designed to produce a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security conference is being held at munich 's bayerischer hof hotel after months of stalling , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday said that his country was willing to accept the deal .
on friday , mottaki said that that was true , but that iran wanted to change some of the details .
on saturday , the european union 's new foreign-policy director , catherine ashton , said that she welcomed the fact that mottaki had decided at the last minute to come to munich .
but she stressed that the iaea plan and overtures conducted by the us administration " have so far gone without adequate response , " warning the iranian regime that " dialogue takes two . "
the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- insisited that iran had brought nothing to the negotiating tabel . " there was not a new proposal , " iaea chief yukiya amano said shortly after a meeting with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on the sidelines of the munich security conference . threat of military action us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in a panel discussion at the conference that world leaders needed to be clear with iran about what is expected of it . " we have n't been clear to this day .
everyone has been running around beating their chest saying iran , you ca n't have a nuclear weapon .
but we have n't been clear . " i think that 's a very waffly way to be trying to control something as serious as this . " fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said . " they should just accept the existing -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposal , " lieberman told dpa .
capital punishment meanwhile , iran rejected european union demands for a halt to the execution of opposition demonstrators .
iran 's foreign minister said during a debate with swedish foreign minister carl bildt that iranians condemned to death in the wake of last year 's disputed election and subsequent unrest were “ criminals . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arash rahmanipour und mohammadreza alizamani were exectued last month mottaki told an audience at the conference that a “ few people ” had burned houses and buses last year .
“ when crime happens , that is not protest , ” he said .
bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .
iranian opposition groups say the election was rigged .
an estimated 4,000 people including reformist politicians and journalists were detained during a crackdown .

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests .

medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "

catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .

" it 's a german-speaking group with a lot of german coaches .

the turkish team has a reputation for tenacity and overcoming obstacles , as they did during the 2008 euro semi-final against germany , where they almost managed a victory despite a roster shot through with injuries and suspensions .
the germans beat them 3-2 with a winning goal in the 79th minute .
germany coach joachim loew said he expected his team and turkey to be the group favorites .
" we should qualify for the finals , i think we can expect that , " loew said after the draw .
battle of the germans there are three german coaches among the six teams .
besides loew , former national coach berti vogts coaches azerbaijan , and bernd storck leads kazakhstan .
vogt said on sunday he looked forward to a windfall after his team was drawn against germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany coach loew may not be be in charge at the euro 2012 " we will receive lots of money thanks to the game against germany , and that means we can build more stadiums and invest in youth development , " vogts said .
" we 're happy to be playing against germany , from whom we can learn a lot and who will let us play .
we know we must improve although we 're on the right path . "
storck said he too was happy with the outcome .
" for us and especially for me , -lrb- it is -rrb- a real highlight to play against germany with kazakhstan , " he said .
" it 's equally good to play against azerbaijan and to meet former germany coach berti vogts in the duel of the outsiders . "
but germany coach joachim loew , who may not be in charge for the tournament after negotiations over the extension of his contract stalled last week , was cautious of facing teams coached by his compatriots .
" logically , it 's not completely simple against kazakhstan and azerbaijan , " he said .
" it 's a german-speaking group with a lot of german coaches .
naturally , germany and turkey are the favorites . "
armenia had originally been a member of group a , but had to be redrawn because of political tensions with azerbaijan .
under a pre-arranged agreement , armenia were moved into group b where they will face russia , slovakia , ireland , macedonia and andorra .
european champions spain were the last drawn team , and they will face the czech republic , scotland , lithuania , and liechtenstein .
world champions italy will face a tougher slate of opponents in world cup 2010 finalists serbia and slovenia .
also in group c are northern ireland , estonia and the faroe islands .
the first qualifiers begin in september , and the final play-offs are set for november 2011 .
draw for euro 2012 qualifiers : group a : germany , turkey , austria , belgium , kazakhstan , azerbaijan .
group b : russia , slovakia , republic of ireland , macedonia , armenia , andorra .
group c : italy , serbia , northern ireland , slovenia , estonia , faroe islands .

that was followed by a crowd-pleasing goal from argentine lucas barrios in the 57th minute to put dortmund ahead .
sebastian jung brought frankfurt back to level terms eight minutes later , scoring his first bundesliga goal with a superb long shot , and alexander meier ensured eintracht would take three points from the match in the 74 minute , after being fed by a fine , defense-splitting pass from halil altintop .

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . " nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is suspicious of iran 's nuclear ambitions iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki met with iaea head yukiya amano on saturday in munich .
amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .
last week , jesuit leaders issued apologies and urged former pupils to notify past abuses by offenders .
the berlin diocese ' special commissioner stefan dybowski urged victims to file charges immediately .
in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .
repeated revelations of pedophile priests have rocked the catholic church in a number of countries in recent years .
in february , pope benedict xvi summoned irish bishops after it emerged that catholic authorities in dublin had covered up abuses for three decades. ipj / epd / kna / afp / reuter / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "
fuel exchange last year the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran .

the turkish team has a reputation for tenacity and overcoming obstacles , as they did during the 2008 euro semi-final against germany , where they almost managed a victory despite a roster shot through with injuries and suspensions .
the germans beat them 3-2 with a winning goal in the 79th minute .
germany coach joachim loew said he expected his team and turkey to be the group favorites .
" we should qualify for the finals , i think we can expect that , " loew said after the draw .
battle of the germans there are three german coaches among the six teams .
besides loew , former national coach berti vogts coaches azerbaijan , and bernd storck leads kazakhstan .
vogt said on sunday he looked forward to a windfall after his team was drawn against germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany coach loew may not be be in charge at the euro 2012 " we will receive lots of money thanks to the game against germany , and that means we can build more stadiums and invest in youth development , " vogts said .
" we 're happy to be playing against germany , from whom we can learn a lot and who will let us play .
we know we must improve although we 're on the right path . "
storck said he too was happy with the outcome .
" for us and especially for me , -lrb- it is -rrb- a real highlight to play against germany with kazakhstan , " he said .
" it 's equally good to play against azerbaijan and to meet former germany coach berti vogts in the duel of the outsiders . "

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .
last week , jesuit leaders issued apologies and urged former pupils to notify past abuses by offenders .
the berlin diocese ' special commissioner stefan dybowski urged victims to file charges immediately .
in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .
repeated revelations of pedophile priests have rocked the catholic church in a number of countries in recent years .
in february , pope benedict xvi summoned irish bishops after it emerged that catholic authorities in dublin had covered up abuses for three decades. ipj / epd / kna / afp / reuter / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 07.02.2010 abuse allegations mount at german catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's elite canisius jesuit college has been rocked by allegations of sexual abuse the catholic church in germany has vowed to probe new reports that claim the extent of sexual abuse by some of its clerics may have been much higher than previously admitted . german news magazine der spiegel reported over the weekend that at least 10 church employees currently face accusations of sexual abuse . the magazine said more than 94 clerics and laymen have been suspected of sexual abuse since 1995 .
but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .
last week , jesuit leaders issued apologies and urged former pupils to notify past abuses by offenders .
the berlin diocese ' special commissioner stefan dybowski urged victims to file charges immediately .
in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .
repeated revelations of pedophile priests have rocked the catholic church in a number of countries in recent years .
in february , pope benedict xvi summoned irish bishops after it emerged that catholic authorities in dublin had covered up abuses for three decades. ipj / epd / kna / afp / reuter / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests . " i have to say that this new doctrine does not reflect the real world , " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the conference .
" nato is not an enemy of russia , " the western alliance froze ties with moscow in 2008 over russia 's intervention in georgia .
but since then , nato has gradually resumed formal contacts .
" i think russia and we share the same interests in success in afghanistan , " rasmussen said .
mending fences visiting moscow in december , rasmussen had rebuffed the kremlin 's call for new defense arrangements in europe , saying he saw no need for a new security treaty as proposed by russia .
medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "
nato countries reacted skeptically , seeing the russian plan as an attempt to divide the alliance and saying that the existing organization for security and cooperation in europe was the right place to discuss security issues. nt / reuters / dpa / editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a strike from arjen robben after just 117 seconds caught the home side off guard .

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . " nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is suspicious of iran 's nuclear ambitions iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki met with iaea head yukiya amano on saturday in munich .
amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said .

but germany coach joachim loew , who may not be in charge for the tournament after negotiations over the extension of his contract stalled last week , was cautious of facing teams coached by his compatriots .
" logically , it 's not completely simple against kazakhstan and azerbaijan , " he said .
" it 's a german-speaking group with a lot of german coaches .
naturally , germany and turkey are the favorites . "
armenia had originally been a member of group a , but had to be redrawn because of political tensions with azerbaijan .

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests . " i have to say that this new doctrine does not reflect the real world , " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the conference .
" nato is not an enemy of russia , " the western alliance froze ties with moscow in 2008 over russia 's intervention in georgia .
but since then , nato has gradually resumed formal contacts .
" i think russia and we share the same interests in success in afghanistan , " rasmussen said .
mending fences visiting moscow in december , rasmussen had rebuffed the kremlin 's call for new defense arrangements in europe , saying he saw no need for a new security treaty as proposed by russia .
medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "
nato countries reacted skeptically , seeing the russian plan as an attempt to divide the alliance and saying that the existing organization for security and cooperation in europe was the right place to discuss security issues. nt / reuters / dpa / editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program .

amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said .

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests . " i have to say that this new doctrine does not reflect the real world , " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the conference .
" nato is not an enemy of russia , " the western alliance froze ties with moscow in 2008 over russia 's intervention in georgia .
but since then , nato has gradually resumed formal contacts .
" i think russia and we share the same interests in success in afghanistan , " rasmussen said .
mending fences visiting moscow in december , rasmussen had rebuffed the kremlin 's call for new defense arrangements in europe , saying he saw no need for a new security treaty as proposed by russia .
medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "
nato countries reacted skeptically , seeing the russian plan as an attempt to divide the alliance and saying that the existing organization for security and cooperation in europe was the right place to discuss security issues. nt / reuters / dpa / editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "

" we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said . " they should just accept the existing -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposal , " lieberman told dpa .
capital punishment meanwhile , iran rejected european union demands for a halt to the execution of opposition demonstrators .
iran 's foreign minister said during a debate with swedish foreign minister carl bildt that iranians condemned to death in the wake of last year 's disputed election and subsequent unrest were “ criminals . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arash rahmanipour und mohammadreza alizamani were exectued last month mottaki told an audience at the conference that a “ few people ” had burned houses and buses last year .
“ when crime happens , that is not protest , ” he said .
bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .
iranian opposition groups say the election was rigged .

last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .
iranian opposition groups say the election was rigged .
an estimated 4,000 people including reformist politicians and journalists were detained during a crackdown .

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .
last week , jesuit leaders issued apologies and urged former pupils to notify past abuses by offenders .
the berlin diocese ' special commissioner stefan dybowski urged victims to file charges immediately .
in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . " nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is suspicious of iran 's nuclear ambitions iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki met with iaea head yukiya amano on saturday in munich .
amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .

" nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is suspicious of iran 's nuclear ambitions iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki met with iaea head yukiya amano on saturday in munich .
amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .
last week , jesuit leaders issued apologies and urged former pupils to notify past abuses by offenders .
the berlin diocese ' special commissioner stefan dybowski urged victims to file charges immediately .
in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .
repeated revelations of pedophile priests have rocked the catholic church in a number of countries in recent years .
in february , pope benedict xvi summoned irish bishops after it emerged that catholic authorities in dublin had covered up abuses for three decades. ipj / epd / kna / afp / reuter / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests . " i have to say that this new doctrine does not reflect the real world , " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the conference .
" nato is not an enemy of russia , " the western alliance froze ties with moscow in 2008 over russia 's intervention in georgia .
but since then , nato has gradually resumed formal contacts .
" i think russia and we share the same interests in success in afghanistan , " rasmussen said .
mending fences visiting moscow in december , rasmussen had rebuffed the kremlin 's call for new defense arrangements in europe , saying he saw no need for a new security treaty as proposed by russia .
medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "
nato countries reacted skeptically , seeing the russian plan as an attempt to divide the alliance and saying that the existing organization for security and cooperation in europe was the right place to discuss security issues. nt / reuters / dpa / editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .

in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . " nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is suspicious of iran 's nuclear ambitions iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki met with iaea head yukiya amano on saturday in munich .
amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . " nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is suspicious of iran 's nuclear ambitions iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki met with iaea head yukiya amano on saturday in munich .
amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .

“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "

bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .

the turkish team has a reputation for tenacity and overcoming obstacles , as they did during the 2008 euro semi-final against germany , where they almost managed a victory despite a roster shot through with injuries and suspensions .
the germans beat them 3-2 with a winning goal in the 79th minute .
germany coach joachim loew said he expected his team and turkey to be the group favorites .
" we should qualify for the finals , i think we can expect that , " loew said after the draw .
battle of the germans there are three german coaches among the six teams .

" we 're happy to be playing against germany , from whom we can learn a lot and who will let us play .
we know we must improve although we 're on the right path . "
storck said he too was happy with the outcome .
" for us and especially for me , -lrb- it is -rrb- a real highlight to play against germany with kazakhstan , " he said .
" it 's equally good to play against azerbaijan and to meet former germany coach berti vogts in the duel of the outsiders . "
but germany coach joachim loew , who may not be in charge for the tournament after negotiations over the extension of his contract stalled last week , was cautious of facing teams coached by his compatriots .
" logically , it 's not completely simple against kazakhstan and azerbaijan , " he said .
" it 's a german-speaking group with a lot of german coaches .
naturally , germany and turkey are the favorites . "
armenia had originally been a member of group a , but had to be redrawn because of political tensions with azerbaijan .
under a pre-arranged agreement , armenia were moved into group b where they will face russia , slovakia , ireland , macedonia and andorra .
european champions spain were the last drawn team , and they will face the czech republic , scotland , lithuania , and liechtenstein .
world champions italy will face a tougher slate of opponents in world cup 2010 finalists serbia and slovenia .

the first qualifiers begin in september , and the final play-offs are set for november 2011 .

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .

" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said .

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests .

but since then , nato has gradually resumed formal contacts .
" i think russia and we share the same interests in success in afghanistan , " rasmussen said .
mending fences visiting moscow in december , rasmussen had rebuffed the kremlin 's call for new defense arrangements in europe , saying he saw no need for a new security treaty as proposed by russia .
medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 07.02.2010 westerwelle dismisses iran 's nuclear offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is unconvinced by iran 's actions german foreign minister guido westerwelle said on saturday that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's foreign minister mottaki said progress had been made in talks with the west " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said on saturday , february 6 .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "
fuel exchange last year the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran .
the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home - a process world powers fear is designed to produce a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security conference is being held at munich 's bayerischer hof hotel after months of stalling , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday said that his country was willing to accept the deal .
on friday , mottaki said that that was true , but that iran wanted to change some of the details .
on saturday , the european union 's new foreign-policy director , catherine ashton , said that she welcomed the fact that mottaki had decided at the last minute to come to munich .
but she stressed that the iaea plan and overtures conducted by the us administration " have so far gone without adequate response , " warning the iranian regime that " dialogue takes two . "
the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- insisited that iran had brought nothing to the negotiating tabel . " there was not a new proposal , " iaea chief yukiya amano said shortly after a meeting with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on the sidelines of the munich security conference . threat of military action us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in a panel discussion at the conference that world leaders needed to be clear with iran about what is expected of it . " we have n't been clear to this day .
everyone has been running around beating their chest saying iran , you ca n't have a nuclear weapon .
but we have n't been clear . " i think that 's a very waffly way to be trying to control something as serious as this . " fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said . " they should just accept the existing -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposal , " lieberman told dpa .
capital punishment meanwhile , iran rejected european union demands for a halt to the execution of opposition demonstrators .
iran 's foreign minister said during a debate with swedish foreign minister carl bildt that iranians condemned to death in the wake of last year 's disputed election and subsequent unrest were “ criminals . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arash rahmanipour und mohammadreza alizamani were exectued last month mottaki told an audience at the conference that a “ few people ” had burned houses and buses last year .
“ when crime happens , that is not protest , ” he said .
bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .
iranian opposition groups say the election was rigged .
an estimated 4,000 people including reformist politicians and journalists were detained during a crackdown .
fresh unrest in december resulted in eight deaths. ipj / nrt / afp / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view .

amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the germans beat them 3-2 with a winning goal in the 79th minute .
germany coach joachim loew said he expected his team and turkey to be the group favorites .
" we should qualify for the finals , i think we can expect that , " loew said after the draw .

storck said he too was happy with the outcome .

but germany coach joachim loew , who may not be in charge for the tournament after negotiations over the extension of his contract stalled last week , was cautious of facing teams coached by his compatriots .
" logically , it 's not completely simple against kazakhstan and azerbaijan , " he said .
" it 's a german-speaking group with a lot of german coaches .
naturally , germany and turkey are the favorites . "
armenia had originally been a member of group a , but had to be redrawn because of political tensions with azerbaijan .
under a pre-arranged agreement , armenia were moved into group b where they will face russia , slovakia , ireland , macedonia and andorra .
european champions spain were the last drawn team , and they will face the czech republic , scotland , lithuania , and liechtenstein .

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . " nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is suspicious of iran 's nuclear ambitions iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki met with iaea head yukiya amano on saturday in munich .
amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .
last week , jesuit leaders issued apologies and urged former pupils to notify past abuses by offenders .
the berlin diocese ' special commissioner stefan dybowski urged victims to file charges immediately .
in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .
repeated revelations of pedophile priests have rocked the catholic church in a number of countries in recent years .
in february , pope benedict xvi summoned irish bishops after it emerged that catholic authorities in dublin had covered up abuses for three decades. ipj / epd / kna / afp / reuter / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .

amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said .

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "
fuel exchange last year the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran .

on saturday , the european union 's new foreign-policy director , catherine ashton , said that she welcomed the fact that mottaki had decided at the last minute to come to munich .
but she stressed that the iaea plan and overtures conducted by the us administration " have so far gone without adequate response , " warning the iranian regime that " dialogue takes two . "
the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- insisited that iran had brought nothing to the negotiating tabel . " there was not a new proposal , " iaea chief yukiya amano said shortly after a meeting with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on the sidelines of the munich security conference . threat of military action us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in a panel discussion at the conference that world leaders needed to be clear with iran about what is expected of it . " we have n't been clear to this day .
everyone has been running around beating their chest saying iran , you ca n't have a nuclear weapon .
but we have n't been clear . " i think that 's a very waffly way to be trying to control something as serious as this . " fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said . " they should just accept the existing -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposal , " lieberman told dpa .
capital punishment meanwhile , iran rejected european union demands for a halt to the execution of opposition demonstrators .
iran 's foreign minister said during a debate with swedish foreign minister carl bildt that iranians condemned to death in the wake of last year 's disputed election and subsequent unrest were “ criminals . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arash rahmanipour und mohammadreza alizamani were exectued last month mottaki told an audience at the conference that a “ few people ” had burned houses and buses last year .
“ when crime happens , that is not protest , ” he said .
bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .
iranian opposition groups say the election was rigged .
an estimated 4,000 people including reformist politicians and journalists were detained during a crackdown .

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests . " i have to say that this new doctrine does not reflect the real world , " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the conference .
" nato is not an enemy of russia , " the western alliance froze ties with moscow in 2008 over russia 's intervention in georgia .
but since then , nato has gradually resumed formal contacts .
" i think russia and we share the same interests in success in afghanistan , " rasmussen said .
mending fences visiting moscow in december , rasmussen had rebuffed the kremlin 's call for new defense arrangements in europe , saying he saw no need for a new security treaty as proposed by russia .
medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "
nato countries reacted skeptically , seeing the russian plan as an attempt to divide the alliance and saying that the existing organization for security and cooperation in europe was the right place to discuss security issues. nt / reuters / dpa / editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- insisited that iran had brought nothing to the negotiating tabel . " there was not a new proposal , " iaea chief yukiya amano said shortly after a meeting with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on the sidelines of the munich security conference . threat of military action us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in a panel discussion at the conference that world leaders needed to be clear with iran about what is expected of it . " we have n't been clear to this day .
everyone has been running around beating their chest saying iran , you ca n't have a nuclear weapon .
but we have n't been clear . " i think that 's a very waffly way to be trying to control something as serious as this . " fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said . " they should just accept the existing -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposal , " lieberman told dpa .
capital punishment meanwhile , iran rejected european union demands for a halt to the execution of opposition demonstrators .
iran 's foreign minister said during a debate with swedish foreign minister carl bildt that iranians condemned to death in the wake of last year 's disputed election and subsequent unrest were “ criminals . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arash rahmanipour und mohammadreza alizamani were exectued last month mottaki told an audience at the conference that a “ few people ” had burned houses and buses last year .
“ when crime happens , that is not protest , ” he said .
bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .
iranian opposition groups say the election was rigged .
an estimated 4,000 people including reformist politicians and journalists were detained during a crackdown .
fresh unrest in december resulted in eight deaths. ipj / nrt / afp / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program .

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests . " i have to say that this new doctrine does not reflect the real world , " nato secretary-general anders fogh rasmussen told reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the conference .
" nato is not an enemy of russia , " the western alliance froze ties with moscow in 2008 over russia 's intervention in georgia .
but since then , nato has gradually resumed formal contacts .
" i think russia and we share the same interests in success in afghanistan , " rasmussen said .
mending fences visiting moscow in december , rasmussen had rebuffed the kremlin 's call for new defense arrangements in europe , saying he saw no need for a new security treaty as proposed by russia .
medvedev had published a draft post-cold war security pact on november 29 , saying this could replace nato and other institutions and restrict the ability of any country to use force unilaterally .
it is a reiteration of russian calls made since 2008 to outlaw " one state enhancing its security at another 's expense . "
nato countries reacted skeptically , seeing the russian plan as an attempt to divide the alliance and saying that the existing organization for security and cooperation in europe was the right place to discuss security issues. nt / reuters / dpa / editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .

" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said .

we must always be concentrated , even with a 2-0 lead , " van gaal told sky tv .

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "
fuel exchange last year the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran .
the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home - a process world powers fear is designed to produce a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security conference is being held at munich 's bayerischer hof hotel after months of stalling , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday said that his country was willing to accept the deal .
on friday , mottaki said that that was true , but that iran wanted to change some of the details .
on saturday , the european union 's new foreign-policy director , catherine ashton , said that she welcomed the fact that mottaki had decided at the last minute to come to munich .
but she stressed that the iaea plan and overtures conducted by the us administration " have so far gone without adequate response , " warning the iranian regime that " dialogue takes two . "
the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- insisited that iran had brought nothing to the negotiating tabel . " there was not a new proposal , " iaea chief yukiya amano said shortly after a meeting with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on the sidelines of the munich security conference . threat of military action us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in a panel discussion at the conference that world leaders needed to be clear with iran about what is expected of it . " we have n't been clear to this day .
everyone has been running around beating their chest saying iran , you ca n't have a nuclear weapon .
but we have n't been clear . " i think that 's a very waffly way to be trying to control something as serious as this . " fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said . " they should just accept the existing -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposal , " lieberman told dpa .
capital punishment meanwhile , iran rejected european union demands for a halt to the execution of opposition demonstrators .
iran 's foreign minister said during a debate with swedish foreign minister carl bildt that iranians condemned to death in the wake of last year 's disputed election and subsequent unrest were “ criminals . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arash rahmanipour und mohammadreza alizamani were exectued last month mottaki told an audience at the conference that a “ few people ” had burned houses and buses last year .
“ when crime happens , that is not protest , ” he said .
bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .

the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .

during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . " nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is suspicious of iran 's nuclear ambitions iran 's foreign minister manouchehr mottaki met with iaea head yukiya amano on saturday in munich .
amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .
last week , jesuit leaders issued apologies and urged former pupils to notify past abuses by offenders .
the berlin diocese ' special commissioner stefan dybowski urged victims to file charges immediately .
in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .
repeated revelations of pedophile priests have rocked the catholic church in a number of countries in recent years .
in february , pope benedict xvi summoned irish bishops after it emerged that catholic authorities in dublin had covered up abuses for three decades. ipj / epd / kna / afp / reuter / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .
" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view .

amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said . " iran is still ready to make the deal and whenever the other side is ready as well , the technical negotiations by the experts could start , " the spokesman added . ipj / dpa / afpe / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program .

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "
fuel exchange last year the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran .
the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home - a process world powers fear is designed to produce a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security conference is being held at munich 's bayerischer hof hotel after months of stalling , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday said that his country was willing to accept the deal .
on friday , mottaki said that that was true , but that iran wanted to change some of the details .
on saturday , the european union 's new foreign-policy director , catherine ashton , said that she welcomed the fact that mottaki had decided at the last minute to come to munich .
but she stressed that the iaea plan and overtures conducted by the us administration " have so far gone without adequate response , " warning the iranian regime that " dialogue takes two . "
the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- insisited that iran had brought nothing to the negotiating tabel . " there was not a new proposal , " iaea chief yukiya amano said shortly after a meeting with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on the sidelines of the munich security conference . threat of military action us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in a panel discussion at the conference that world leaders needed to be clear with iran about what is expected of it . " we have n't been clear to this day .
everyone has been running around beating their chest saying iran , you ca n't have a nuclear weapon .
but we have n't been clear . " i think that 's a very waffly way to be trying to control something as serious as this . " fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said .

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .
last week , jesuit leaders issued apologies and urged former pupils to notify past abuses by offenders .
the berlin diocese ' special commissioner stefan dybowski urged victims to file charges immediately .
in severe cases , the diocese would itself call in state prosecutors , he said .
repeated revelations of pedophile priests have rocked the catholic church in a number of countries in recent years .
in february , pope benedict xvi summoned irish bishops after it emerged that catholic authorities in dublin had covered up abuses for three decades. ipj / epd / kna / afp / reuter / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the germans beat them 3-2 with a winning goal in the 79th minute .
germany coach joachim loew said he expected his team and turkey to be the group favorites .
" we should qualify for the finals , i think we can expect that , " loew said after the draw .
battle of the germans there are three german coaches among the six teams .

" it may be that the sanctions screw needs to be or can be turned here and there , " guttenberg told reporters at the annual munich security conference on sunday , january 7 .
" we need to consider very carefully what impact our options could have . " " at the same time , however , it must be made clear to iran that our patience is at an end . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president blames the west for the stalemate over a nuclear fuel deal he was speaking after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said his country would soon start enriching uranium to 20 percent on its own . " we are still interested in cooperation -lsb- with the west -rsb- but if they want to continue playing games with the iranian nation , then we will be prepared to do the 20 percent by ourselves , " ahmadinejad said at a laser technology conference in tehran on sunday . the president of the islamic nation said the iranian atomic organization -lrb- iao -rrb- was ready to begin the uranium enrichment and would eventually do so . " i have given -lsb- world powers -rsb- a time range of two to three months to accept the deal but if they do n't , we would start ourselves , " he said . " now dr -lsb- ali akbar -rsb- salehi , should start to make the 20 percent with the centrifuges , " the president said , addressing iran 's nuclear chief who was sitting in the audience at a laser technology plant in tehran . later , iran 's arabic-language television station al alam quoted salehi as saying iran would formally inform the vienna-based united nations nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , about the move in a letter on monday .
he said production would take place at the natanz enrichment facility in central iran . state media also quoted salehi as saying that iran plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities during the next year . uranium exchange last year , the iaea proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister was not impressed by iran 's appearance in munich the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home and so allay fears held by world powers that iran might try to produce a nuclear bomb . after months of stalling , ahmadinejad said last week said that his country was willing to accept the deal . western officials at the munich conference on saturday criticized iran , however , for not submitting a concrete plan for uranium exchange , and accused tehran of pursuing a secret program to manufacture an atomic bomb . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said that iran still had to prove to the rest of the world that it was willing to make meaningful concessions regarding its nuclear program . " our hand is still reaching out towards -lsb- iran -rsb- , " westerwelle said .

amano said the iranians brought nothing new to the table . " we had a very interesting discussion , " amano said .
" there was not a new proposal . " foreign ministry spokesman for the islamic republic , ramin mehmanparast , said on sunday that remarks by western officials in munich had complicated the issue of uranium exchange . he said comments suggesting that iran should not have nuclear weapons were irrelevant to the main issue , which was to implement a deal based on an initiative by the iaea , which , he said , should not be a " political propaganda " forum . " raising the irrelevant issue of nuclear weapons which have never been in our military doctrine , -lsb- the world powers -rsb- have just further complicated the issue , " mehmanparast said .

but germany coach joachim loew , who may not be in charge for the tournament after negotiations over the extension of his contract stalled last week , was cautious of facing teams coached by his compatriots .
" logically , it 's not completely simple against kazakhstan and azerbaijan , " he said .
" it 's a german-speaking group with a lot of german coaches .
naturally , germany and turkey are the favorites . "
armenia had originally been a member of group a , but had to be redrawn because of political tensions with azerbaijan .

it was perfect revenge for last season 's 5-1 drubbing by the wolves - one of bayern 's worst bundesliga defeats on record .
a strike from arjen robben after just 117 seconds caught the home side off guard .
this was followed by a goal daniel van buyten and an own goal from andrea barzaglio , which were enough to extend bayern 's unbeaten record run to 14 games and seal their eighth victory .
however dutch coach louis van gaal was not fully satisfied with his side 's performance . " we played arrogantly , we were not concentrated .
we must always be concentrated , even with a 2-0 lead , " van gaal told sky tv .
bayern 's keeper butt earned some praise for a 65-minute penalty save against grafite , ending all hopes of a comeback by wolfsburg who now slip down to 12th place .

but only 30 of those suspects had actually been prosecuted , the report said , because of legal time constraints on pursuing cases .
the latest reports come amid a widening scandal of serial sex abuse by catholic priests in germany .
earlier this week , berlin 's elite canisius college admitted systematic abuse of pupils by at least two roman catholic priests between 1975 and 1983 who once taught there . one of them has reportedly denied doing so .
suspicions have since emerged at three other jesuit-run schools , in hamburg , bonn and in the black forest region , also dating back to the 1970s and 80s .
catholic church vows to clarify abuses the catholic church reacted to the latest reports by condemning the abuse and vowing to take action .
during a sunday service in hanover 's basilica , regional catholic deacon , provost martin tenge , said the church 's " whole institution " bore blame through an attitude of " please do n't talk about it . "
" when a catholic priest , representing an institution with such high moral notions , commits sexual abuse , this leads to an unrectifiable breach , " tenge said .
the secretary of germany 's catholic bishops conference , hans langendoerfer , said : " we want clarification .
we want to address the subject openly .
the revelations show a dark chapter of the church that horrifies me , " he told der spiegel 's website . "
guidelines adopted in 2002 had , he said , established a " good system " to investigate sexual abuse allegations .

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "
fuel exchange last year the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposed that iran ship low-intensity uranium abroad for enrichment , then re-import the enriched variant for use in a medical reactor , used to treat cancer patients , in tehran .
the idea was to give iran access to peaceful nuclear technology without it enriching uranium at home - a process world powers fear is designed to produce a nuclear bomb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security conference is being held at munich 's bayerischer hof hotel after months of stalling , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday said that his country was willing to accept the deal .
on friday , mottaki said that that was true , but that iran wanted to change some of the details .
on saturday , the european union 's new foreign-policy director , catherine ashton , said that she welcomed the fact that mottaki had decided at the last minute to come to munich .
but she stressed that the iaea plan and overtures conducted by the us administration " have so far gone without adequate response , " warning the iranian regime that " dialogue takes two . "
the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- insisited that iran had brought nothing to the negotiating tabel . " there was not a new proposal , " iaea chief yukiya amano said shortly after a meeting with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on the sidelines of the munich security conference . threat of military action us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in a panel discussion at the conference that world leaders needed to be clear with iran about what is expected of it . " we have n't been clear to this day .
everyone has been running around beating their chest saying iran , you ca n't have a nuclear weapon .
but we have n't been clear . " i think that 's a very waffly way to be trying to control something as serious as this . " fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said . " they should just accept the existing -lrb- iaea -rrb- proposal , " lieberman told dpa .
capital punishment meanwhile , iran rejected european union demands for a halt to the execution of opposition demonstrators .
iran 's foreign minister said during a debate with swedish foreign minister carl bildt that iranians condemned to death in the wake of last year 's disputed election and subsequent unrest were “ criminals . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arash rahmanipour und mohammadreza alizamani were exectued last month mottaki told an audience at the conference that a “ few people ” had burned houses and buses last year .
“ when crime happens , that is not protest , ” he said .
bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
mottaki drew hisses from some in the munich audience when he insisted that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad had been re-elected last june by a margin of 11 million votes .
iranian opposition groups say the election was rigged .
an estimated 4,000 people including reformist politicians and journalists were detained during a crackdown .
fresh unrest in december resulted in eight deaths. ipj / nrt / afp / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unfortunately , this opportunity was missed , since the choice was made in favor of nato 's expansion policy , dividing europe into zones but moving these lines deliberately to the east , " lavrov said . his criticism came a day after russian president dmitry medvedev approved a new russian military doctrine that singles out nato expansion , describing it as a military threat that undermines efforts to improve ties between the western military alliance and moscow . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's rasmussen has dismissed the russian military doctrine nato 's leadership was quick to reject the new russian military doctrine and insist that the two sides share common interests .

" but so far it 's reaching out into a void .
and i 've seen nothing since yesterday that makes me want to change that view . "
these comments came 12 hours after iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki - a surprise visitor at this year 's munich security conference - said that he expected a deal between his country and western powers " in the not very distant future . "
westerwelle called for combined efforts world-wide to reduce both conventional and nuclear weapons and stressed that the international community could not accept a nuclear-armed iran .
" that would lead to a destabilization of the whole region , " he said .
“ further , it would fatally weaken the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . ”
in order to prove it was actually serious , germany 's vice chancellor said iran " must take action . "

" fellow us lawmaker , us senator joe lieberman , who heads the senate committe on homeland security , told the german press agency dpa that the world faces a choice between imposing tough sanctions against iran or launching a military strike . lieberman was the last speaker of the day on saturday and obviously frustrated at the iranian foreign minister ’ s late-night speech on friday did n't mince his words . " we have a choice here : to go to tough economic sanctions to make diplomacy work or we will face the prospect of military action against iran , " lieberman said . that is because a nuclear-armed iran would create chaos in the middle east , send oil prices soaring and shatter any hope of an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict , he said .

bildt urged mottaki to halt anticipated judicial killings of nine opposition demonstrators who were handed death sentences by iranian authorities last tuesday .
if iran went ahead with those executions , eu-iranian relations would be affected in a " most detrimental " way , bildt said .
last month , the eu , along with amnesty international , had condemned the hangings of the dissidents mohammed reza alizamani and arash rahmani .
capital punishment is barred across europe under a council of europe convention and is outlawed or no longer practiced by 140 of the 192 un member nations .
