but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 03.06.2010 eu steps up humanitarian aid to africa 's sahel region großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is sounding the alarm about hunger in africa millions of people in africa 's sahel region are suffering a severe famine , made worse by erratic rainfall .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer women -pipe- 03.06.2010 opinion : women in power should back other women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german labor minister von der leyen is one of chancellor merkel 's most popular cabinet members - and a potential candidate for the presidency .
a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .

ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .

losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .

but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .

australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .

after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .
massive cuts inevitable guttenberg himself proposed cuts in military expenditure to the tune of 1 billion euros to help the government get to grips with its ballooning budget deficit .
his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .
however , precise details about the cutbacks in the german military wo n't be available before the end of this weekend , when a special government meeting aimed at discussing overall cuts in the budget will take place. uh / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under a concept called " citizens in uniform , " german political leaders aimed to bring the national armed forces closer to the general public and improve their tarnished image after the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan mission has raised doubts about the conscript army 's readiness for combat up until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years .
however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .

in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "

it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .
it now already has four branches there , explains michael kotzbauer , the bank 's asia head and the reason for wanting to expand in china lies in germany .
" we are deeply rooted in the small-and-medium enterprises segment .
we want to market ourselves as a bank for small-and-medium enterprises abroad in the same way as we market ourselves in this way in germany . " commerzbank customers divided into two groups in china a year and a half ago , the european airplane manufacturer airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in tianjin .
several medium-sized suppliers followed airbus . many are commerzbank customers , kotzbauer says , and belong to the first group of customers in china – german companies that have traditionally been with the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus assembly plant in the northern port of tianjin the second group is made up of chinese companies wanting to buy medium-sized companies in germany , to which commerzbank can provide advice . deutsche bank is also on the chinese market commerzbank is not alone in china : its biggest competitor in germany , deutsche bank is also keen to expand its business there .
deutsche bank asia head robert ranking recently announced he wanted to make four billion euros from business in asia in 2011 . but his bank , as opposed to commerzbank , is focussing on private customers .
to get closer to chinese customers , it now has holdings of almost 20 percent in the chinese hua xia bank – this is the legal restriction . " we simply see it as a strategically-important investment for our private customer base in asia and the experiences that we have made until now in our cooperation with hua xia have been very positive , " says michael lermer , a spokesman for deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is focussing on china 's private customer market lermer rejects criticism from the chinese side that cooperation has been limited to capital : " we have 850,000 customers in the credit card segment in china .
we have also made very good steps with our partner hua xia bank in strategic cooperation . " greater domestic competition although deutsche bank and commerzbank are direct rivals in germany , in china they have taken different paths . " we know that deutsche bank is already actively working with private customers in asia , " says kotzbauer , who is not worried . " we do n't have any ambition to go into the private customer business .
there are already very strong asian banks that specialise in the private customer business and know the local market very well .
we should also stick to what we know well . " however , analysts say it will not be too long before deutsche bank and commerzbank come up against each other in china too .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers include charles romani of france -lrb- center -rrb- one of the crew members , frenchman romain charles told journalists what he was packing for the mission .
" some pictures , books for my leisure time , " charles said . " trying to keep busy during those times , not to think too much about what is outside the module , trying to be focused on the trip . "
the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

the two sides also discussed the thorny issue of border stability . wen jiabao is the first chinese premier to visit myanmar in 16 years .
his short visit was aimed at boosting economic ties .
on thursday , mr wen met junta chief than shwe in the capital naypyidaw and also held talks with his burmese counterpart , thein sein .
the two prime ministers witnessed the signing of 15 economic agreements on issues ranging from a natural gas pipeline , a hydroproject , trade and finance , according to china 's official news agency xinhua . china also offered more aid to myanmar , xinhua said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader sen. gen. than shwe pariah 's state 's key ally military-run myanmar is largely shunned by western countries because of the lack of democracy and poor human rights record .

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .
some analysts even speak of genocide . " every indian government could risk prosecution " indian lawyer and human rights activist prashant bhushan says that every indian government could be brought to trial by the international criminal court in the hague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists accuse gujarat chief minister narendra modi of failing to protect minority rights " since the ratification process began , there have been two governments – one led by the hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party and this one led by congress .
if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .
our politicians and those in power have always tried to influence the courts and the judiciary .
they rightly fear that this would not be possible with the icc , " says bhushan . genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity the icc prosecutes individuals for three particular crimes - crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes . these are officially embodied in indian law , bhushan concedes , “ but in reality our legal system fell apart a long time ago .
a normal citizen can barely ensure that his or her rights are guaranteed . " even if he or she tries , it can take years before a case is closed and accepted by all sides .
there is also so much corruption .
rich and influential people have always exploited the system and will continue to do so . " brutality in indian-administered kashmir parvez imroz is an activist who has discovered mass graves and reported about torture and rape in indian-administered kashmir .
he accuses the indian security forces of acting brutally against the civilian population with impunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian soldiers in kashmir allegedly use brutality against the civilian population with impunity - here they are standing guard during a curfew " when one is in a conflict zone , one is under immense pressure from the state , " he says .
" if one reveals human rights violations or turns the disappearance of people without a trace into an international topic , the international community takes this very seriously .
pressure is then exercized on india to look into the allegations . " experts say that india and other asian states do not want to ratify the international criminal court out of fear they will lose their sovereignty and that they wil lose face in the eyes of world opinion .
however , their refusal to ratify the statute has consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .
last weekend , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble signalled that germans may have to endure a tax hike to get the country back on the right track .
merkel 's government may consider whether to raise the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to the full rate of 19 percent on certain items that currently benefit from a reduced rate of seven percent , the reuters news agency reported. mz / sh / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer women -pipe- 03.06.2010 opinion : women in power should back other women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german labor minister von der leyen is one of chancellor merkel 's most popular cabinet members - and a potential candidate for the presidency .
a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .

goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .
last weekend , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble signalled that germans may have to endure a tax hike to get the country back on the right track .
merkel 's government may consider whether to raise the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to the full rate of 19 percent on certain items that currently benefit from a reduced rate of seven percent , the reuters news agency reported. mz / sh / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.06.2010 two german retail chains up for grabs at ‘ clearance sale ’ großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro wants to partially merge karstadt and kaufhof major department store chains karstadt and kaufhof are up for sale .
while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "

his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .

guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.06.2010 two german retail chains up for grabs at ‘ clearance sale ’ großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro wants to partially merge karstadt and kaufhof major department store chains karstadt and kaufhof are up for sale .
while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer politics -pipe- 03.06.2010 moderate conservativism could be wulff 's key to success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff has been state premier since 2003 in his most recent election to lower saxony state premier , the opposition criticized christian wulff for staying too much in the political center .
but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .

the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers include charles romani of france -lrb- center -rrb- one of the crew members , frenchman romain charles told journalists what he was packing for the mission .
" some pictures , books for my leisure time , " charles said . " trying to keep busy during those times , not to think too much about what is outside the module , trying to be focused on the trip . "
the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .
a model space ship has been built , with limited living space for each crew member , equipment for numerous experiments to be carried out on board , as well as a greenhouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the container where the first 105 day isolation experiment took place in july 2009 the experiment is being jointly conducted by russia , china and the european space agency and is designed to analyse the psychological and physical effects of such a long term trip into space .
the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.06.2010 german banks want to conquer the chinese market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank is homing in on china 's medium-sized enterprises while german politicians discuss how banks should also be made to share the costs of the financial crisis , germany 's biggest financial institutions are investing in china – the world 's biggest growth market . 2009 was a catastrophic year for germany 's commerzbank .
it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .
it now already has four branches there , explains michael kotzbauer , the bank 's asia head and the reason for wanting to expand in china lies in germany .
" we are deeply rooted in the small-and-medium enterprises segment .
we want to market ourselves as a bank for small-and-medium enterprises abroad in the same way as we market ourselves in this way in germany . " commerzbank customers divided into two groups in china a year and a half ago , the european airplane manufacturer airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in tianjin .
several medium-sized suppliers followed airbus . many are commerzbank customers , kotzbauer says , and belong to the first group of customers in china – german companies that have traditionally been with the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus assembly plant in the northern port of tianjin the second group is made up of chinese companies wanting to buy medium-sized companies in germany , to which commerzbank can provide advice . deutsche bank is also on the chinese market commerzbank is not alone in china : its biggest competitor in germany , deutsche bank is also keen to expand its business there .
deutsche bank asia head robert ranking recently announced he wanted to make four billion euros from business in asia in 2011 . but his bank , as opposed to commerzbank , is focussing on private customers .
to get closer to chinese customers , it now has holdings of almost 20 percent in the chinese hua xia bank – this is the legal restriction . " we simply see it as a strategically-important investment for our private customer base in asia and the experiences that we have made until now in our cooperation with hua xia have been very positive , " says michael lermer , a spokesman for deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is focussing on china 's private customer market lermer rejects criticism from the chinese side that cooperation has been limited to capital : " we have 850,000 customers in the credit card segment in china .
we have also made very good steps with our partner hua xia bank in strategic cooperation . " greater domestic competition although deutsche bank and commerzbank are direct rivals in germany , in china they have taken different paths . " we know that deutsche bank is already actively working with private customers in asia , " says kotzbauer , who is not worried . " we do n't have any ambition to go into the private customer business .
there are already very strong asian banks that specialise in the private customer business and know the local market very well .
we should also stick to what we know well . " however , analysts say it will not be too long before deutsche bank and commerzbank come up against each other in china too .
their task will not be made easier by increasing competition from chinese banks and stronger state regulation . author : jun yan / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

the two sides also discussed the thorny issue of border stability . wen jiabao is the first chinese premier to visit myanmar in 16 years .
his short visit was aimed at boosting economic ties .
on thursday , mr wen met junta chief than shwe in the capital naypyidaw and also held talks with his burmese counterpart , thein sein .
the two prime ministers witnessed the signing of 15 economic agreements on issues ranging from a natural gas pipeline , a hydroproject , trade and finance , according to china 's official news agency xinhua . china also offered more aid to myanmar , xinhua said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader sen. gen. than shwe pariah 's state 's key ally military-run myanmar is largely shunned by western countries because of the lack of democracy and poor human rights record .

it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .
it now already has four branches there , explains michael kotzbauer , the bank 's asia head and the reason for wanting to expand in china lies in germany .
" we are deeply rooted in the small-and-medium enterprises segment .
we want to market ourselves as a bank for small-and-medium enterprises abroad in the same way as we market ourselves in this way in germany . " commerzbank customers divided into two groups in china a year and a half ago , the european airplane manufacturer airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in tianjin .
several medium-sized suppliers followed airbus . many are commerzbank customers , kotzbauer says , and belong to the first group of customers in china – german companies that have traditionally been with the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus assembly plant in the northern port of tianjin the second group is made up of chinese companies wanting to buy medium-sized companies in germany , to which commerzbank can provide advice . deutsche bank is also on the chinese market commerzbank is not alone in china : its biggest competitor in germany , deutsche bank is also keen to expand its business there .
deutsche bank asia head robert ranking recently announced he wanted to make four billion euros from business in asia in 2011 . but his bank , as opposed to commerzbank , is focussing on private customers .
to get closer to chinese customers , it now has holdings of almost 20 percent in the chinese hua xia bank – this is the legal restriction . " we simply see it as a strategically-important investment for our private customer base in asia and the experiences that we have made until now in our cooperation with hua xia have been very positive , " says michael lermer , a spokesman for deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is focussing on china 's private customer market lermer rejects criticism from the chinese side that cooperation has been limited to capital : " we have 850,000 customers in the credit card segment in china .
we have also made very good steps with our partner hua xia bank in strategic cooperation . " greater domestic competition although deutsche bank and commerzbank are direct rivals in germany , in china they have taken different paths . " we know that deutsche bank is already actively working with private customers in asia , " says kotzbauer , who is not worried . " we do n't have any ambition to go into the private customer business .
there are already very strong asian banks that specialise in the private customer business and know the local market very well .
we should also stick to what we know well . " however , analysts say it will not be too long before deutsche bank and commerzbank come up against each other in china too .
their task will not be made easier by increasing competition from chinese banks and stronger state regulation . author : jun yan / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement was made on thursday evening by chancellor angela merkel in berlin . germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president is the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff enjoys broad coalition support broad coalition support in a statement in berlin , chancellor merkel endorsed wulff , saying he was " always curious about people , trying new things and creative . "
merkel was supported by her coalition allies the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu .
leader of the fdp guido westerwelle said wulff was a man with a " clear inner compass . "
" he understands the need to be there for all citizens , but also the spiritual needs of our republic , " said westerwelle .
next stages the opposition social democrat and green parties have announced their candidate as 70-year-old joachim gauck .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers include charles romani of france -lrb- center -rrb- one of the crew members , frenchman romain charles told journalists what he was packing for the mission .
" some pictures , books for my leisure time , " charles said . " trying to keep busy during those times , not to think too much about what is outside the module , trying to be focused on the trip . "
the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .
a model space ship has been built , with limited living space for each crew member , equipment for numerous experiments to be carried out on board , as well as a greenhouse .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

the two sides also discussed the thorny issue of border stability . wen jiabao is the first chinese premier to visit myanmar in 16 years .
his short visit was aimed at boosting economic ties .

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .
some analysts even speak of genocide . " every indian government could risk prosecution " indian lawyer and human rights activist prashant bhushan says that every indian government could be brought to trial by the international criminal court in the hague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists accuse gujarat chief minister narendra modi of failing to protect minority rights " since the ratification process began , there have been two governments – one led by the hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party and this one led by congress .
if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .
our politicians and those in power have always tried to influence the courts and the judiciary .
they rightly fear that this would not be possible with the icc , " says bhushan . genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity the icc prosecutes individuals for three particular crimes - crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes . these are officially embodied in indian law , bhushan concedes , “ but in reality our legal system fell apart a long time ago .
a normal citizen can barely ensure that his or her rights are guaranteed . " even if he or she tries , it can take years before a case is closed and accepted by all sides .
there is also so much corruption .
rich and influential people have always exploited the system and will continue to do so . " brutality in indian-administered kashmir parvez imroz is an activist who has discovered mass graves and reported about torture and rape in indian-administered kashmir .
he accuses the indian security forces of acting brutally against the civilian population with impunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian soldiers in kashmir allegedly use brutality against the civilian population with impunity - here they are standing guard during a curfew " when one is in a conflict zone , one is under immense pressure from the state , " he says .
" if one reveals human rights violations or turns the disappearance of people without a trace into an international topic , the international community takes this very seriously .

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .
some analysts even speak of genocide . " every indian government could risk prosecution " indian lawyer and human rights activist prashant bhushan says that every indian government could be brought to trial by the international criminal court in the hague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists accuse gujarat chief minister narendra modi of failing to protect minority rights " since the ratification process began , there have been two governments – one led by the hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party and this one led by congress .
if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .
our politicians and those in power have always tried to influence the courts and the judiciary .
they rightly fear that this would not be possible with the icc , " says bhushan . genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity the icc prosecutes individuals for three particular crimes - crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes . these are officially embodied in indian law , bhushan concedes , “ but in reality our legal system fell apart a long time ago .
a normal citizen can barely ensure that his or her rights are guaranteed . " even if he or she tries , it can take years before a case is closed and accepted by all sides .
there is also so much corruption .
rich and influential people have always exploited the system and will continue to do so . " brutality in indian-administered kashmir parvez imroz is an activist who has discovered mass graves and reported about torture and rape in indian-administered kashmir .
he accuses the indian security forces of acting brutally against the civilian population with impunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian soldiers in kashmir allegedly use brutality against the civilian population with impunity - here they are standing guard during a curfew " when one is in a conflict zone , one is under immense pressure from the state , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 03.06.2010 eu steps up humanitarian aid to africa 's sahel region großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is sounding the alarm about hunger in africa millions of people in africa 's sahel region are suffering a severe famine , made worse by erratic rainfall .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .

the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .
a model space ship has been built , with limited living space for each crew member , equipment for numerous experiments to be carried out on board , as well as a greenhouse .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "

leader of the fdp guido westerwelle said wulff was a man with a " clear inner compass . "
" he understands the need to be there for all citizens , but also the spiritual needs of our republic , " said westerwelle .
next stages the opposition social democrat and green parties have announced their candidate as 70-year-old joachim gauck .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .
last weekend , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble signalled that germans may have to endure a tax hike to get the country back on the right track .
merkel 's government may consider whether to raise the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to the full rate of 19 percent on certain items that currently benefit from a reduced rate of seven percent , the reuters news agency reported. mz / sh / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement was made on thursday evening by chancellor angela merkel in berlin . germany 's governing coalition on thursday announced their candidate for president is the state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff .
chancellor angela merkel led the proposals for wulff as the successor to horst koehler , who resigned unexpectedly at the start of the week .
wulff has governed the state of lower saxony since 2003 and would be germany 's youngest-ever president .
he is a deputy leader of merkel 's christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff enjoys broad coalition support broad coalition support in a statement in berlin , chancellor merkel endorsed wulff , saying he was " always curious about people , trying new things and creative . "
merkel was supported by her coalition allies the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu .
leader of the fdp guido westerwelle said wulff was a man with a " clear inner compass . "
" he understands the need to be there for all citizens , but also the spiritual needs of our republic , " said westerwelle .
next stages the opposition social democrat and green parties have announced their candidate as 70-year-old joachim gauck .
the former east german civil rights leader and theologian is so far the only candidate standing against wulff .
the federal convention is scheduled to vote on the new president at the end of the month .
the assembly is made up of 1,244 state and federal lawmakers , and merkel 's coalition has a majority .
the role of the german president is largely ceremonial , although the president does sign off on legislation and is seen as a figurehead on national issues. cb / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .

if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .
our politicians and those in power have always tried to influence the courts and the judiciary .
they rightly fear that this would not be possible with the icc , " says bhushan . genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity the icc prosecutes individuals for three particular crimes - crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes . these are officially embodied in indian law , bhushan concedes , “ but in reality our legal system fell apart a long time ago .
a normal citizen can barely ensure that his or her rights are guaranteed . " even if he or she tries , it can take years before a case is closed and accepted by all sides .
there is also so much corruption .
rich and influential people have always exploited the system and will continue to do so . " brutality in indian-administered kashmir parvez imroz is an activist who has discovered mass graves and reported about torture and rape in indian-administered kashmir .
he accuses the indian security forces of acting brutally against the civilian population with impunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian soldiers in kashmir allegedly use brutality against the civilian population with impunity - here they are standing guard during a curfew " when one is in a conflict zone , one is under immense pressure from the state , " he says .
" if one reveals human rights violations or turns the disappearance of people without a trace into an international topic , the international community takes this very seriously .
pressure is then exercized on india to look into the allegations . " experts say that india and other asian states do not want to ratify the international criminal court out of fear they will lose their sovereignty and that they wil lose face in the eyes of world opinion .
however , their refusal to ratify the statute has consequences .

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .
some analysts even speak of genocide . " every indian government could risk prosecution " indian lawyer and human rights activist prashant bhushan says that every indian government could be brought to trial by the international criminal court in the hague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists accuse gujarat chief minister narendra modi of failing to protect minority rights " since the ratification process began , there have been two governments – one led by the hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party and this one led by congress .
if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .
our politicians and those in power have always tried to influence the courts and the judiciary .
they rightly fear that this would not be possible with the icc , " says bhushan . genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity the icc prosecutes individuals for three particular crimes - crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes . these are officially embodied in indian law , bhushan concedes , “ but in reality our legal system fell apart a long time ago .
a normal citizen can barely ensure that his or her rights are guaranteed . " even if he or she tries , it can take years before a case is closed and accepted by all sides .
there is also so much corruption .
rich and influential people have always exploited the system and will continue to do so . " brutality in indian-administered kashmir parvez imroz is an activist who has discovered mass graves and reported about torture and rape in indian-administered kashmir .
he accuses the indian security forces of acting brutally against the civilian population with impunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian soldiers in kashmir allegedly use brutality against the civilian population with impunity - here they are standing guard during a curfew " when one is in a conflict zone , one is under immense pressure from the state , " he says .
" if one reveals human rights violations or turns the disappearance of people without a trace into an international topic , the international community takes this very seriously .
pressure is then exercized on india to look into the allegations . " experts say that india and other asian states do not want to ratify the international criminal court out of fear they will lose their sovereignty and that they wil lose face in the eyes of world opinion .
however , their refusal to ratify the statute has consequences .

it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .
it now already has four branches there , explains michael kotzbauer , the bank 's asia head and the reason for wanting to expand in china lies in germany .
" we are deeply rooted in the small-and-medium enterprises segment .
we want to market ourselves as a bank for small-and-medium enterprises abroad in the same way as we market ourselves in this way in germany . " commerzbank customers divided into two groups in china a year and a half ago , the european airplane manufacturer airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in tianjin .
several medium-sized suppliers followed airbus . many are commerzbank customers , kotzbauer says , and belong to the first group of customers in china – german companies that have traditionally been with the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus assembly plant in the northern port of tianjin the second group is made up of chinese companies wanting to buy medium-sized companies in germany , to which commerzbank can provide advice . deutsche bank is also on the chinese market commerzbank is not alone in china : its biggest competitor in germany , deutsche bank is also keen to expand its business there .
deutsche bank asia head robert ranking recently announced he wanted to make four billion euros from business in asia in 2011 . but his bank , as opposed to commerzbank , is focussing on private customers .
to get closer to chinese customers , it now has holdings of almost 20 percent in the chinese hua xia bank – this is the legal restriction . " we simply see it as a strategically-important investment for our private customer base in asia and the experiences that we have made until now in our cooperation with hua xia have been very positive , " says michael lermer , a spokesman for deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is focussing on china 's private customer market lermer rejects criticism from the chinese side that cooperation has been limited to capital : " we have 850,000 customers in the credit card segment in china .
we have also made very good steps with our partner hua xia bank in strategic cooperation . " greater domestic competition although deutsche bank and commerzbank are direct rivals in germany , in china they have taken different paths . " we know that deutsche bank is already actively working with private customers in asia , " says kotzbauer , who is not worried . " we do n't have any ambition to go into the private customer business .
there are already very strong asian banks that specialise in the private customer business and know the local market very well .
we should also stick to what we know well . " however , analysts say it will not be too long before deutsche bank and commerzbank come up against each other in china too .
their task will not be made easier by increasing competition from chinese banks and stronger state regulation . author : jun yan / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .

while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "

in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .

the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .

all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.06.2010 two german retail chains up for grabs at ‘ clearance sale ’ großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metro wants to partially merge karstadt and kaufhof major department store chains karstadt and kaufhof are up for sale .
while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .
under a concept called " citizens in uniform , " german political leaders aimed to bring the national armed forces closer to the general public and improve their tarnished image after the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan mission has raised doubts about the conscript army 's readiness for combat up until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years .
however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .
massive cuts inevitable guttenberg himself proposed cuts in military expenditure to the tune of 1 billion euros to help the government get to grips with its ballooning budget deficit .
his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .
however , precise details about the cutbacks in the german military wo n't be available before the end of this weekend , when a special government meeting aimed at discussing overall cuts in the budget will take place. uh / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his short visit was aimed at boosting economic ties .
on thursday , mr wen met junta chief than shwe in the capital naypyidaw and also held talks with his burmese counterpart , thein sein .
the two prime ministers witnessed the signing of 15 economic agreements on issues ranging from a natural gas pipeline , a hydroproject , trade and finance , according to china 's official news agency xinhua . china also offered more aid to myanmar , xinhua said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader sen. gen. than shwe pariah 's state 's key ally military-run myanmar is largely shunned by western countries because of the lack of democracy and poor human rights record .
the west imposed sanctions on myanmar in 1988 , after a military crackdown on pro-democracy protests . china remains myanmar 's major ally and a trading partner , especially in the mining sector .
in november last year , a top chinese oil producer began constructing a pipeline across myanmar . border issue despite the close relations between the junta and the chinese leadership , there was some tension last year when clashes broke out between myanmar 's military and rebel ethnic forces in myanmar 's remote northeast , leading to thousands of refugees fleeing into china 's yunnan province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees who fled myanmar last august at a temporary refugee center in the chinese border town of nansan on thursday , both countries agreed to maintain stability in the border regions .
according to xinhua , chinese premier wen jiabao said he and myanmar prime minister thein sein had " reached a broad understanding on protecting the peace and stability of the border regions . " wen 's visit came at a time when myanmar 's military government is preparing for elections that it has announced for this year .
the international community and human rights groups have already dismissed the polls as a sham because of new laws that effectively led to the exclusion of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . there was no confirmation that the chinese pm discussed the elections with the junta leaders during his trip . in 1990 , suu kyi 's party won the last national polls by a landslide but the ruling generals refused to recognize the results .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .

goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .

the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .

it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .
some analysts even speak of genocide .

if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .
our politicians and those in power have always tried to influence the courts and the judiciary .
they rightly fear that this would not be possible with the icc , " says bhushan . genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity the icc prosecutes individuals for three particular crimes - crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes . these are officially embodied in indian law , bhushan concedes , “ but in reality our legal system fell apart a long time ago .
a normal citizen can barely ensure that his or her rights are guaranteed . " even if he or she tries , it can take years before a case is closed and accepted by all sides .
there is also so much corruption .
rich and influential people have always exploited the system and will continue to do so . " brutality in indian-administered kashmir parvez imroz is an activist who has discovered mass graves and reported about torture and rape in indian-administered kashmir .
he accuses the indian security forces of acting brutally against the civilian population with impunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian soldiers in kashmir allegedly use brutality against the civilian population with impunity - here they are standing guard during a curfew " when one is in a conflict zone , one is under immense pressure from the state , " he says .
" if one reveals human rights violations or turns the disappearance of people without a trace into an international topic , the international community takes this very seriously .
pressure is then exercized on india to look into the allegations . " experts say that india and other asian states do not want to ratify the international criminal court out of fear they will lose their sovereignty and that they wil lose face in the eyes of world opinion .
however , their refusal to ratify the statute has consequences .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .

in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .

losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .

while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .

but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .
under a concept called " citizens in uniform , " german political leaders aimed to bring the national armed forces closer to the general public and improve their tarnished image after the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan mission has raised doubts about the conscript army 's readiness for combat up until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years .
however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .
massive cuts inevitable guttenberg himself proposed cuts in military expenditure to the tune of 1 billion euros to help the government get to grips with its ballooning budget deficit .
his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .
however , precise details about the cutbacks in the german military wo n't be available before the end of this weekend , when a special government meeting aimed at discussing overall cuts in the budget will take place. uh / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .
under a concept called " citizens in uniform , " german political leaders aimed to bring the national armed forces closer to the general public and improve their tarnished image after the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan mission has raised doubts about the conscript army 's readiness for combat up until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years .
however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .
massive cuts inevitable guttenberg himself proposed cuts in military expenditure to the tune of 1 billion euros to help the government get to grips with its ballooning budget deficit .
his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .
however , precise details about the cutbacks in the german military wo n't be available before the end of this weekend , when a special government meeting aimed at discussing overall cuts in the budget will take place. uh / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .
some analysts even speak of genocide . " every indian government could risk prosecution " indian lawyer and human rights activist prashant bhushan says that every indian government could be brought to trial by the international criminal court in the hague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists accuse gujarat chief minister narendra modi of failing to protect minority rights " since the ratification process began , there have been two governments – one led by the hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party and this one led by congress .
if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .
our politicians and those in power have always tried to influence the courts and the judiciary .
they rightly fear that this would not be possible with the icc , " says bhushan . genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity the icc prosecutes individuals for three particular crimes - crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes . these are officially embodied in indian law , bhushan concedes , “ but in reality our legal system fell apart a long time ago .
a normal citizen can barely ensure that his or her rights are guaranteed . " even if he or she tries , it can take years before a case is closed and accepted by all sides .
there is also so much corruption .
rich and influential people have always exploited the system and will continue to do so . " brutality in indian-administered kashmir parvez imroz is an activist who has discovered mass graves and reported about torture and rape in indian-administered kashmir .
he accuses the indian security forces of acting brutally against the civilian population with impunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian soldiers in kashmir allegedly use brutality against the civilian population with impunity - here they are standing guard during a curfew " when one is in a conflict zone , one is under immense pressure from the state , " he says .
" if one reveals human rights violations or turns the disappearance of people without a trace into an international topic , the international community takes this very seriously .
pressure is then exercized on india to look into the allegations . " experts say that india and other asian states do not want to ratify the international criminal court out of fear they will lose their sovereignty and that they wil lose face in the eyes of world opinion .
however , their refusal to ratify the statute has consequences .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .
last weekend , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble signalled that germans may have to endure a tax hike to get the country back on the right track .
merkel 's government may consider whether to raise the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to the full rate of 19 percent on certain items that currently benefit from a reduced rate of seven percent , the reuters news agency reported. mz / sh / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign aid -pipe- 03.06.2010 eu steps up humanitarian aid to africa 's sahel region großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is sounding the alarm about hunger in africa millions of people in africa 's sahel region are suffering a severe famine , made worse by erratic rainfall .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .
last weekend , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble signalled that germans may have to endure a tax hike to get the country back on the right track .
merkel 's government may consider whether to raise the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to the full rate of 19 percent on certain items that currently benefit from a reduced rate of seven percent , the reuters news agency reported. mz / sh / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer women -pipe- 03.06.2010 opinion : women in power should back other women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german labor minister von der leyen is one of chancellor merkel 's most popular cabinet members - and a potential candidate for the presidency .
a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .
last weekend , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble signalled that germans may have to endure a tax hike to get the country back on the right track .
merkel 's government may consider whether to raise the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to the full rate of 19 percent on certain items that currently benefit from a reduced rate of seven percent , the reuters news agency reported. mz / sh / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german budget cuts could include troop reductions reducing germany 's budget deficit is on the agenda of a government meeting on sunday and monday .
the defense ministry is expected to tighten its belt , which could lead to a reduction of bundeswehr troops .
-lrb- 02.06.2010 -rrb- german army set to shrink as budget cuts loom as germany nervously awaits an austerity budget due at the end of june , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warns of barracks closures and troop levels being slashed from quarter of a million to 200 thousand .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .

food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .

remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

chinese premier wen jiabao met junta chief than shwe during his two-day visit to the military state .
the two sides also discussed the thorny issue of border stability . wen jiabao is the first chinese premier to visit myanmar in 16 years .
his short visit was aimed at boosting economic ties .
on thursday , mr wen met junta chief than shwe in the capital naypyidaw and also held talks with his burmese counterpart , thein sein .
the two prime ministers witnessed the signing of 15 economic agreements on issues ranging from a natural gas pipeline , a hydroproject , trade and finance , according to china 's official news agency xinhua . china also offered more aid to myanmar , xinhua said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader sen. gen. than shwe pariah 's state 's key ally military-run myanmar is largely shunned by western countries because of the lack of democracy and poor human rights record .
the west imposed sanctions on myanmar in 1988 , after a military crackdown on pro-democracy protests . china remains myanmar 's major ally and a trading partner , especially in the mining sector .
in november last year , a top chinese oil producer began constructing a pipeline across myanmar . border issue despite the close relations between the junta and the chinese leadership , there was some tension last year when clashes broke out between myanmar 's military and rebel ethnic forces in myanmar 's remote northeast , leading to thousands of refugees fleeing into china 's yunnan province .

" wen 's visit came at a time when myanmar 's military government is preparing for elections that it has announced for this year .
the international community and human rights groups have already dismissed the polls as a sham because of new laws that effectively led to the exclusion of opposition leader aung san suu kyi . there was no confirmation that the chinese pm discussed the elections with the junta leaders during his trip . in 1990 , suu kyi 's party won the last national polls by a landslide but the ruling generals refused to recognize the results .

despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .

the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .

goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .

" some pictures , books for my leisure time , " charles said . " trying to keep busy during those times , not to think too much about what is outside the module , trying to be focused on the trip . "
the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .

the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.06.2010 german banks want to conquer the chinese market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank is homing in on china 's medium-sized enterprises while german politicians discuss how banks should also be made to share the costs of the financial crisis , germany 's biggest financial institutions are investing in china – the world 's biggest growth market . 2009 was a catastrophic year for germany 's commerzbank .
it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .
it now already has four branches there , explains michael kotzbauer , the bank 's asia head and the reason for wanting to expand in china lies in germany .
" we are deeply rooted in the small-and-medium enterprises segment .
we want to market ourselves as a bank for small-and-medium enterprises abroad in the same way as we market ourselves in this way in germany . " commerzbank customers divided into two groups in china a year and a half ago , the european airplane manufacturer airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in tianjin .
several medium-sized suppliers followed airbus . many are commerzbank customers , kotzbauer says , and belong to the first group of customers in china – german companies that have traditionally been with the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus assembly plant in the northern port of tianjin the second group is made up of chinese companies wanting to buy medium-sized companies in germany , to which commerzbank can provide advice . deutsche bank is also on the chinese market commerzbank is not alone in china : its biggest competitor in germany , deutsche bank is also keen to expand its business there .
deutsche bank asia head robert ranking recently announced he wanted to make four billion euros from business in asia in 2011 . but his bank , as opposed to commerzbank , is focussing on private customers .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .

however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .
massive cuts inevitable guttenberg himself proposed cuts in military expenditure to the tune of 1 billion euros to help the government get to grips with its ballooning budget deficit .
his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .

however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .

his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .

while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .

while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .
some analysts even speak of genocide . " every indian government could risk prosecution " indian lawyer and human rights activist prashant bhushan says that every indian government could be brought to trial by the international criminal court in the hague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists accuse gujarat chief minister narendra modi of failing to protect minority rights " since the ratification process began , there have been two governments – one led by the hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party and this one led by congress .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer women -pipe- 03.06.2010 opinion : women in power should back other women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german labor minister von der leyen is one of chancellor merkel 's most popular cabinet members - and a potential candidate for the presidency .
a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

while karstadt is still looking for a savior a year after filing for bankruptcy , retail giant metro is looking to shed its profitable kaufhof chain . metro has confirmed it plans to sell its department store subsidiary kaufhof , at the same time reiterating its interest in buying some karstadt stores from arcandor , the retail and tourism group that collapsed last year .
by cherry-picking the rival chain 's most profitable units , kaufhof would undoubtedly become more attractive for investors .
but administrators in charge of winding up arcandor have made it clear they would prefer to sell all of karstadt 's 120 stores in a single package . new potential buyer for karstadt until last weekend , there were three known bidders for karstadt – the goldman sachs-led consortium highstreet , buyout firm triton and billionaire nicolas berggruen - who had submitted detailed bids by a may 28 deadline . then came news of a fourth potential bidder : a spokesman for the chain 's insolvency administrator confirmed on saturday that they had received the letter , adding that they “ forwarded it on to the investment bank to check . "
however , the spokesman declined to identify the interested party that may compete against the original bidders . the spiegel newsmagazine reported that a st. petersburg , russia-based businessman artur pakhomov had made an offer in the mid-double-digit million-euro range to buy the entirety of karstadt .

based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .

the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cordes never misses an opportunity to praise kaufhof 's performance the magazine also said pakhomov was willing to finance karstadt 's christmas 2010 sales season and planned to invest around 80 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- annually to secure karstadt 's long-term viability and develop the chain internationally . pakhomov reportedly has interests in real estate and owns several hotels in st. petersburg through his holding company , karotex . decision expected soon the question now is : who will take over the two traditional chains – founded in 1881 by rudolf karstadt in wismar , and in 1879 by leonhard tietz in stralsund ? coincidentally , june 7 will mark a milestone in both cases . karstadt ’ s creditors ’ committee , which is set to meet in the city of essen on monday , will decide which bidder will bag the contract .
based in nearby dusseldorf , metro is still some way away from making up its mind about the sale of its subsidiary kaufhof . however , with a view to the imminent karstadt decision , metro ceo eckhard cordes is keen to know how much interest there is .
therefore , potential kaufhof buyers are also to lay their cards on the table by monday .
among the interested parties are financial investors apollo , blackstone and permira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group wants to focus on its wholesale and consumer electronics operations despite reports that there may be a few investors who are interested in both chains , it appears there is still no single bidder for both . stark differences karstadt and kaufhof stores attract more than three million customers per day .
the retailers are often situated in the best locations of the city centers .
both department store chains are big employers , with a staff of about 25,000 each . however , the circumstances leading up to the proposed sale of the two chains could not be more different . in june 2009 , karstadt had to file for bankruptcy after plunging from one crisis to the next .
only a few are privy to the company ’ s current business figures . but an inventory drawn up by buyout firm triton indicates that karstadt ’ s turnover has declined constantly for 15 years – amidst rising costs . kaufhof on the other hand , presents a very different picture : metro chief cordes praises the group ’ s subsidiary like a good salesman whenever he has the opportunity to do so .
he recently spoke of " sensational " developments at kaufhof . in 2009 , the retail store increased its adjusted operating profit by 3.4 percent to 119 million euros , despite seeing turnover fall by 1.9 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
however , the costs incurred by the group ’ s restructuring are not included in these figures .
the net profit earned by metro ’ s subsidiaries has not been published . why sell a valuable business ? considering kaufhof is so profitable , it begs the question as to by metro wants to shed such a valuable subsidiary . cordes is in the process of revamping the group , putting wholesale business at the core of the company . metro wholesale markets for traders produce most of the concern ’ s profit abroad .
it will also focus on its consumer electronics operations , with the media markt and saturn chains expanding in eastern europe and asia . in order to enter new markets such as indonesia and brazil , cordes says the group will need more financial flexibility .
he estimates kaufhof can be sold for a price of 2-3 billion euros . what makes kaufhof so valuable is the real estate : about half the stores are owned by metro .
bildunterschrift : karstadt employees may learn of their fate on monday retail stores on the way out ? a total of 200 german department stores - from the legendary kadewe in the capital berlin to the alsterhaus in hamburg - are currently up for sale . retail expert michael gerling believes that the number of department stores in germany will tend to fall , although he does not fear they will become extinct like dinosaurs . one only needs to look at department stores in switzerland , england and spain show that they can be successful .
however , he says the concept needs to be revised and polished a little .
he adds that mergers and cost reductions can not solve all problems . gerling says shopping must be an experience .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .

the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .

however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .
massive cuts inevitable guttenberg himself proposed cuts in military expenditure to the tune of 1 billion euros to help the government get to grips with its ballooning budget deficit .
his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .
however , precise details about the cutbacks in the german military wo n't be available before the end of this weekend , when a special government meeting aimed at discussing overall cuts in the budget will take place. uh / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .
last weekend , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble signalled that germans may have to endure a tax hike to get the country back on the right track .
merkel 's government may consider whether to raise the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to the full rate of 19 percent on certain items that currently benefit from a reduced rate of seven percent , the reuters news agency reported. mz / sh / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .

the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .
under a concept called " citizens in uniform , " german political leaders aimed to bring the national armed forces closer to the general public and improve their tarnished image after the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan mission has raised doubts about the conscript army 's readiness for combat up until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years .
however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .
massive cuts inevitable guttenberg himself proposed cuts in military expenditure to the tune of 1 billion euros to help the government get to grips with its ballooning budget deficit .
his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .
however , precise details about the cutbacks in the german military wo n't be available before the end of this weekend , when a special government meeting aimed at discussing overall cuts in the budget will take place. uh / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .

the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

but india , along with china , is reluctant to ratify the rome treaty . india likes to boast it is the biggest democracy in the world with 1.13 billion inhabitants .
but just below the surface , tensions are simmering . prime minister manmohan singh never tires from repeating that the biggest threat to india ’ s security are the maoist rebels .
the situation in kashmir has been tense ever since independence in 1947 . recent history also paints a bleak picture .
human rights organizations estimate that in 1984 almost 3,000 people were killed in massacres triggered by the assassination of the indian prime minister indira gandhi by her sikh bodyguards . eight years after riots broke out between hindus and muslims in the state of gujarat , these have yet to be dealt with .
some analysts even speak of genocide . " every indian government could risk prosecution " indian lawyer and human rights activist prashant bhushan says that every indian government could be brought to trial by the international criminal court in the hague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists accuse gujarat chief minister narendra modi of failing to protect minority rights " since the ratification process began , there have been two governments – one led by the hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party and this one led by congress .
if india had signed the icc statute , narendra modi , the bjp chief minister of gujarat , could be brought to trial . " the same is true for the congress party , which says that it is acting against maoist rebels but in reality is fighting against india ’ s indigenous population .
our politicians and those in power have always tried to influence the courts and the judiciary .
they rightly fear that this would not be possible with the icc , " says bhushan . genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity the icc prosecutes individuals for three particular crimes - crimes against humanity , genocide and war crimes . these are officially embodied in indian law , bhushan concedes , “ but in reality our legal system fell apart a long time ago .
a normal citizen can barely ensure that his or her rights are guaranteed . " even if he or she tries , it can take years before a case is closed and accepted by all sides .
there is also so much corruption .
rich and influential people have always exploited the system and will continue to do so . " brutality in indian-administered kashmir parvez imroz is an activist who has discovered mass graves and reported about torture and rape in indian-administered kashmir .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .

as part of an experiment to study effects of long term isolation that would come with a manned mission to mars , the men have begun a 520-day period of isolation in a special facility in moscow .
three russians , along with one man each from france , italy and china , have entered the 550-cubic-meter facility where they will spend the next year and a half of their lives .
the length of the trip is designed to simulate the amount of time it would take to travel to mars and back .
the russian commander aleksei sitev said he was taking part because it was " interesting " and " beneficial . "
" i 'm taking part in a unique experiment , and in an interesting adventure , " sitev said .
physical and psychological challenge inside the facility , the men 's time will be divided into three eight-hour blocks - one for sleeping , one for working , and one for leisure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers include charles romani of france -lrb- center -rrb- one of the crew members , frenchman romain charles told journalists what he was packing for the mission .
" some pictures , books for my leisure time , " charles said . " trying to keep busy during those times , not to think too much about what is outside the module , trying to be focused on the trip . "
the men will only be able to communicate with the outside world via email , which would also be the case on a real trip to mars .
the model space ship the flight simulation takes part in the institute for biomedical problems in moscow , which has taken part in the preparation of most russian space flights .
a model space ship has been built , with limited living space for each crew member , equipment for numerous experiments to be carried out on board , as well as a greenhouse .

the volunteers will live exactly like real astronauts , except that they wo n't experience weightlessness and there is no cosmic radiation to deal with .
all the food for the 520-day experiment had been given to the participants in advance , and it is up to them to ration it accordingly .
goodbye real world the hatch that closed behind the ' space explorers ' will not be opened again until the experiment ends or one of the participants is forced to drop out .
this is something that project director boris morukov hopes will not happen .
" every crew member has the right to stop and quit the experiment ... we have had such a negative experience in the past , " morukov said .
" i hope it wo n't happen again during this experiment . "
the crew members themselves are convinced that it will not be necessary .
according to russian team-member sukrob kalamov , there is at least one thing that unites them all : they have all been foolish enough to take part in this experiment .

losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .

losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.06.2010 german banks want to conquer the chinese market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank is homing in on china 's medium-sized enterprises while german politicians discuss how banks should also be made to share the costs of the financial crisis , germany 's biggest financial institutions are investing in china – the world 's biggest growth market . 2009 was a catastrophic year for germany 's commerzbank .
it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .
it now already has four branches there , explains michael kotzbauer , the bank 's asia head and the reason for wanting to expand in china lies in germany .
" we are deeply rooted in the small-and-medium enterprises segment .
we want to market ourselves as a bank for small-and-medium enterprises abroad in the same way as we market ourselves in this way in germany . " commerzbank customers divided into two groups in china a year and a half ago , the european airplane manufacturer airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in tianjin .
several medium-sized suppliers followed airbus . many are commerzbank customers , kotzbauer says , and belong to the first group of customers in china – german companies that have traditionally been with the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus assembly plant in the northern port of tianjin the second group is made up of chinese companies wanting to buy medium-sized companies in germany , to which commerzbank can provide advice . deutsche bank is also on the chinese market commerzbank is not alone in china : its biggest competitor in germany , deutsche bank is also keen to expand its business there .
deutsche bank asia head robert ranking recently announced he wanted to make four billion euros from business in asia in 2011 . but his bank , as opposed to commerzbank , is focussing on private customers .
to get closer to chinese customers , it now has holdings of almost 20 percent in the chinese hua xia bank – this is the legal restriction . " we simply see it as a strategically-important investment for our private customer base in asia and the experiences that we have made until now in our cooperation with hua xia have been very positive , " says michael lermer , a spokesman for deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is focussing on china 's private customer market lermer rejects criticism from the chinese side that cooperation has been limited to capital : " we have 850,000 customers in the credit card segment in china .
we have also made very good steps with our partner hua xia bank in strategic cooperation . " greater domestic competition although deutsche bank and commerzbank are direct rivals in germany , in china they have taken different paths . " we know that deutsche bank is already actively working with private customers in asia , " says kotzbauer , who is not worried . " we do n't have any ambition to go into the private customer business .

chancellor merkel is reportedly up in arms . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has reopened a long-simmering debate about the draft in germany , saying he would n't shy away from " radical and controversial measures " in his efforts to cut back on military expenditure .
" against the background of the latest savings proposal , i 'm determined to put the issue of military conscription back on the agenda , " the german defense minister said in a keynote speech on military policy in hamburg recently .
as part of the government 's planned austerity measures , the german military is facing cuts of 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- annually over the next three years .
guttenberg was planning to " suspend the draft for an unspecified period of time , " a defense ministry official said on wednesday , adding " its complete abolition could save up to 400 million euros per year . "
sacred cow for more than five decades , the issue of military conscription has been almost sacrosanct in germany .
under a concept called " citizens in uniform , " german political leaders aimed to bring the national armed forces closer to the general public and improve their tarnished image after the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan mission has raised doubts about the conscript army 's readiness for combat up until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years .
however , conscripts could claim moral objections to military service , having to do civil service instead .
after german unification in 1991 , military service was shortened several times .
the latest reduction , to just 6 months , is scheduled to be introduced this summer .
the reduction was a demand by the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - junior partners in the government coalition led by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" the defense minister has raised the right issue at the right time , " said fdp general secretary christian lindner .
guttenberg could " count on the fdp 's support in his effort to make the bundeswehr -lsb- the german army -rsb- fit for the future " , he said and added : " the suspension of the draft does n't just make sense from a financial point of view , but also with regard to national security . "
merkel up in arms however , there has been strong resistance to the proposal from the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel was n't amused by guttenberg 's proposal " the end of military conscription can not be explained with the need for savings , let alone be pushed through in just three days " , chancellor angela merkel is quoted as saying by the " financial times germany " newspaper in its thursday edition .
the newspaper cited a source who had taken part in a meeting of cdu / csu leaders on wednesday .
" nobody knew about guttenberg 's plans , and every participant in the meeting was up in arms , " the source was quoted as saying .
massive cuts inevitable guttenberg himself proposed cuts in military expenditure to the tune of 1 billion euros to help the government get to grips with its ballooning budget deficit .
his plans would also include trimming the size of the bundeswehr from 250,000 troops to 150,000 , the rheinische post newspaper reported on thursday .
in addition , cuts were also envisaged in military procurement , the newspaper said . the defense ministry is reportedly looking into projects such as the meads missile defense system and the eurofighter aircraft , orders for which could either be reduced or cancelled altogether .
however , precise details about the cutbacks in the german military wo n't be available before the end of this weekend , when a special government meeting aimed at discussing overall cuts in the budget will take place. uh / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the meantime , chancellor merkel 's cabinet is considering where to make the cuts . it 's no secret that the german government is on the brink of some serious belt-tightening to get its budget deficit under control .
however , it is still unclear exactly what those measures will entail , and where the cuts will come from .
on thursday , members of chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are meeting to continue the debate on the issue ahead of a special session beginning on sunday where concrete plans are expected to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : army bases may be closed as part of cuts to military spending berlin is on track to exceed the european union 's budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product by a wide margin in 2010 .
the predicted five percent deficit is modest compared to the deficits in some other eu member states , but for europe 's largest economy and chief crusader for tougher budget discipline , it 's still too much .
merkel 's ruling center-right party hopes to slash the deficit with austerity measures beginning in 2011 .
on the chopping block the german government faces the mammoth task of saving 10 billion euros per year .
chancellor merkel had previously declared pensions and education to be safe from the drastic savings measures that are expected to be applied to other areas .
defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said steep military spending cuts would be necessary in light of the federal government 's precarious financial position , and the german media offers all kinds of speculation as to what this could entail .
the daily stuttgarter zeitung reports that the size of the german military could be slashed by 40 percent .
there is also talk of abolishing germany 's mandatory military service completely .
last weekend , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble signalled that germans may have to endure a tax hike to get the country back on the right track .

in accepting the nomination , wulff said the office of president was " a great duty , with great responsibility . "
he added he " looked forward to the challenge " and would try to " bring optimism in difficult times . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "

chinese premier wen jiabao met junta chief than shwe during his two-day visit to the military state .
the two sides also discussed the thorny issue of border stability . wen jiabao is the first chinese premier to visit myanmar in 16 years .
his short visit was aimed at boosting economic ties .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.06.2010 loew 's attacking youngsters may alter germany 's workmanlike image großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boateng , marin and oezil are young and hungry far from being a cobbled-together list of the only players still fit , the germany team set to take on bosnia on thursday - and the world in south africa - suggests coach jogi loew wants to attack , attack , attack . much has been said about joachim loew 's hand being forced by injuries when it came to naming his 23-man germany squad for this summer 's world cup .
losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

chinese premier wen jiabao met junta chief than shwe during his two-day visit to the military state .
the two sides also discussed the thorny issue of border stability . wen jiabao is the first chinese premier to visit myanmar in 16 years .
his short visit was aimed at boosting economic ties .
on thursday , mr wen met junta chief than shwe in the capital naypyidaw and also held talks with his burmese counterpart , thein sein .
the two prime ministers witnessed the signing of 15 economic agreements on issues ranging from a natural gas pipeline , a hydroproject , trade and finance , according to china 's official news agency xinhua . china also offered more aid to myanmar , xinhua said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader sen. gen. than shwe pariah 's state 's key ally military-run myanmar is largely shunned by western countries because of the lack of democracy and poor human rights record .
the west imposed sanctions on myanmar in 1988 , after a military crackdown on pro-democracy protests . china remains myanmar 's major ally and a trading partner , especially in the mining sector .
in november last year , a top chinese oil producer began constructing a pipeline across myanmar . border issue despite the close relations between the junta and the chinese leadership , there was some tension last year when clashes broke out between myanmar 's military and rebel ethnic forces in myanmar 's remote northeast , leading to thousands of refugees fleeing into china 's yunnan province .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.06.2010 german banks want to conquer the chinese market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank is homing in on china 's medium-sized enterprises while german politicians discuss how banks should also be made to share the costs of the financial crisis , germany 's biggest financial institutions are investing in china – the world 's biggest growth market . 2009 was a catastrophic year for germany 's commerzbank .
it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .
it now already has four branches there , explains michael kotzbauer , the bank 's asia head and the reason for wanting to expand in china lies in germany .
" we are deeply rooted in the small-and-medium enterprises segment .
we want to market ourselves as a bank for small-and-medium enterprises abroad in the same way as we market ourselves in this way in germany . " commerzbank customers divided into two groups in china a year and a half ago , the european airplane manufacturer airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in tianjin .
several medium-sized suppliers followed airbus . many are commerzbank customers , kotzbauer says , and belong to the first group of customers in china – german companies that have traditionally been with the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus assembly plant in the northern port of tianjin the second group is made up of chinese companies wanting to buy medium-sized companies in germany , to which commerzbank can provide advice . deutsche bank is also on the chinese market commerzbank is not alone in china : its biggest competitor in germany , deutsche bank is also keen to expand its business there .
deutsche bank asia head robert ranking recently announced he wanted to make four billion euros from business in asia in 2011 . but his bank , as opposed to commerzbank , is focussing on private customers .
to get closer to chinese customers , it now has holdings of almost 20 percent in the chinese hua xia bank – this is the legal restriction . " we simply see it as a strategically-important investment for our private customer base in asia and the experiences that we have made until now in our cooperation with hua xia have been very positive , " says michael lermer , a spokesman for deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is focussing on china 's private customer market lermer rejects criticism from the chinese side that cooperation has been limited to capital : " we have 850,000 customers in the credit card segment in china .
we have also made very good steps with our partner hua xia bank in strategic cooperation . " greater domestic competition although deutsche bank and commerzbank are direct rivals in germany , in china they have taken different paths . " we know that deutsche bank is already actively working with private customers in asia , " says kotzbauer , who is not worried . " we do n't have any ambition to go into the private customer business .
there are already very strong asian banks that specialise in the private customer business and know the local market very well .
we should also stick to what we know well . " however , analysts say it will not be too long before deutsche bank and commerzbank come up against each other in china too .
their task will not be made easier by increasing competition from chinese banks and stronger state regulation . author : jun yan / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was only saved from collapse by the german state , which took over 25 percent .
however , massive losses in 2009 have not stopped germany 's second-biggest credit institute from wanting to make its mark on the chinese market .
it now already has four branches there , explains michael kotzbauer , the bank 's asia head and the reason for wanting to expand in china lies in germany .
" we are deeply rooted in the small-and-medium enterprises segment .
we want to market ourselves as a bank for small-and-medium enterprises abroad in the same way as we market ourselves in this way in germany . " commerzbank customers divided into two groups in china a year and a half ago , the european airplane manufacturer airbus opened its first assembly plant outside of europe in tianjin .
several medium-sized suppliers followed airbus . many are commerzbank customers , kotzbauer says , and belong to the first group of customers in china – german companies that have traditionally been with the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an airbus assembly plant in the northern port of tianjin the second group is made up of chinese companies wanting to buy medium-sized companies in germany , to which commerzbank can provide advice . deutsche bank is also on the chinese market commerzbank is not alone in china : its biggest competitor in germany , deutsche bank is also keen to expand its business there .
deutsche bank asia head robert ranking recently announced he wanted to make four billion euros from business in asia in 2011 . but his bank , as opposed to commerzbank , is focussing on private customers .
to get closer to chinese customers , it now has holdings of almost 20 percent in the chinese hua xia bank – this is the legal restriction . " we simply see it as a strategically-important investment for our private customer base in asia and the experiences that we have made until now in our cooperation with hua xia have been very positive , " says michael lermer , a spokesman for deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank is focussing on china 's private customer market lermer rejects criticism from the chinese side that cooperation has been limited to capital : " we have 850,000 customers in the credit card segment in china .
we have also made very good steps with our partner hua xia bank in strategic cooperation . " greater domestic competition although deutsche bank and commerzbank are direct rivals in germany , in china they have taken different paths . " we know that deutsche bank is already actively working with private customers in asia , " says kotzbauer , who is not worried . " we do n't have any ambition to go into the private customer business .
there are already very strong asian banks that specialise in the private customer business and know the local market very well .
we should also stick to what we know well . " however , analysts say it will not be too long before deutsche bank and commerzbank come up against each other in china too .
their task will not be made easier by increasing competition from chinese banks and stronger state regulation . author : jun yan / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

but that very quality may be his ticket to the german presidency . lower saxony state premier christian wulff was officially unveiled as the government 's candidate for the german presidency on thursday evening in berlin .
wulff 's moderate style and ability to appeal across and within party lines make him well-suited to be german president , a post that is mostly ceremonial and traditionally avoids polarizing politics .
he belongs to the center of his christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but unabashedly defends its liberal economic policies .
despite rumors circulating that he has for years found his state-level position to be unsatisfying , he has always denied an ambition to become chancellor angela merkel 's personal favorite .
if he is indeed elected to the presidency on june 30 , he would be only the second catholic to assume the post since 1949 .
he would also likely be the president with the youngest family : a teenage daughter and a two-year-old son .
bildunterschrift : wulff has kept close to chancellor angela merkel long political history wulff , 50 , began his political career early on in life : at 18 years old he joined the cdu federal executive committee and became national head of the party 's national high school program .
while he sat on committees relating to economics and social security , he avoided pigeon-holing himself in both organizations .
despite his reputation of being more of a one-man fighter than a team player , he has also transcended party lines on some issues .
his first performance on a grand scale was in january 1993 , when his party nominated him to be state premier in lower saxony .
he ended up losing to gerhard schroeder of the social democrats , who would six years later become german chancellor .
but he assumed a new position the following year as head of the state 's cdu faction .
in 1998 he ran for the same office , and lost once again .
it was n't until 2003 that he finally won , beating out sigmar gabriel , now national leader of the social democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff 's family would be one of germany 's youngest first families walking the line wulff 's ascension to front-runner in the german presidency race has two main reasons .
the first is the 2003 national election , when voters dissatisfied with social democratic leadership ousted the party from the chancellorship .
the second reason was his time leading the opposition , which sharpened his political skills and gained him trust among voters in lower saxony - enough to win three consecutive terms as state premier .
in his most recent election campaign , opposition parties criticized him for trying to gain popularity by staying too much in the middle and not taking a strong stance on controversial issues .
still , that same moderate style may be his greatest asset in becoming president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .

the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner says the time to act is now , before the situation gets worse . european union officials say as many as million people are facing severe hunger in africa 's sahel region , the belt , which stretches across the grasslands , savannas and steppes of northern africa , linking the atlantic ocean to the west and the red sea to the east .
the european commission has warned the situation - particularly in niger and chad - is getting worse by the day .
the crisis in africa 's sahel region began with last year 's erratic rainfall , which brought a drastic decline in food production , reducing crops by 35 percent . the european commission has responded by stepping up its humanitarian assistance bringing the amount for this year to 54 million euros -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- .
rising prices the european commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid , kristalina georgieva , said the help was meant to be preventative .
" there is a need to help countries in extraordinary circumstances , and hopefully act before a bad situation turns into a catastrophe , " georgieva told reporters in brussels on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgieva wants to see action before the situation gets worse for the sahel region , climate change is not the only problem .
food prices have risen by 30 percent in the last five years .
the economic crisis has made matters even worse .
remittances have collapsed and incomes are drastically down .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said the population needed urgent help to survive the period until the next harvest in november .
eat local as a first priority , the eu aid is to go towards preventing malnutrition in children and pregnant women .
the commission also wants to identify the people most at risk from famine , and make sure they can access health services , and work on early diagnoses .
the eu 's humanitarian aid commissioner said as much as food as possible would be sourced from the region , to stimulate the local farming economy- part of a broader long-term development strategy .
" the last couple of years we have gone up from almost a third to almost half of food aid being locally-purchased , " georgieva said .
quality over quantity in addition , humanitarian efforts are to shift the focus to the nutritional quality of the food , rather than on sheer quantity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fallout from the global banking crisis may impact humanitarian aid to africa " if you are led by just quantity , you may not do your job , because the food does n't do anything for improved nutrition , " the eu humanitarian aid commissioner said .
the european union prides itself on being the world 's biggest aid donor , but some fear that of the current economic crisis could result in european governments backing away from aid pledges .
the eu is increasingly keen for emerging powers like china to become humanitarian actors , rather than aid recipients .
above all , the european commission insists that it wants to prevent disasters from happening , and make sure aid is not just spent , but invested in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.06.2010 turkey opens a new chapter in kurdish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani 's trip to turkey could start a new era iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani is in the middle of his first official visit to ankara as kurdistan president .
the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .

the trip represents a major step in turkey 's relationship with kurds on both sides of the border . on his landmark visit to ankara on thursday , massoud barzani , president of the iraqi kurdistan region and the leader of the kurdistan democratic party -lrb- kdp -rrb- made pledges that testified to the major renewal of turkish-kurd relations that has developed recently .
" we are against the continuation of violence .
we do not see turkey 's security as separate from our own .
we will expend all efforts to end this deplorable situation , " barzani said after talks with foreign minister ahmet davutoglu .
barzani went on to promise that " all efforts " would be made to stop separatist kurdish violence against turkey .
the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which has fought ankara since 1984 , has bases in remote mountains in barzani 's autonomous region in northern iraq , which it uses as a launching pad for attacks on turkish targets across the border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has toned down its anti-kurd rhetoric mounting pkk violence this year culminated in a rocket attack on a navy base monday , which killed six soldiers and prompted a flurry of security meetings in ankara .
and the rebels also sought to overshadow barzani 's visit on thursday by scrapping a year-old unilateral ceasefire and announcing its intention to resume attacks against turkish forces .
" two days ago , we started waging attacks against the turkish army in response to their repeated military attacks against the party and political attacks facing kurds in turkey , " pkk spokesman ahmed danees told reuters in kurdistan .
but recent elections in iraq established the kdp as the strongest kurdish party in the country , consolidating barzani 's position as the major representative of iraqi kurds .
turkey , for its part , has also dropped its more hostile rhetoric , shifting to a policy of seeking cooperation with the local authorities to curb the rebels .
barzani himself was often derided as a " tribal leader " at the peak of past tensions , but he is being greeted this week as the kurds ' " regional president . "
kurdistan is not going away gareth stansfield , associate fellow at the british think tank chatham house , is positive about the new spirit of rapprochement behind the current visit .
" it is very big news , but it has been coming for some time , " he told deutsche welle .
" it does indicate that we 're into a new era of the turkish relationship with the kurds , both across the border and its own . "
turkey is tired of the 26 years of violent conflict with the pkk on its eastern border , and is , according to stansfield , ready for a new approach .
the country is slowly having to accept that the kurdistan region has become consolidated , and is not going to go away .
" arguably , it 's much more difficult for them not to accept it , and much more costly for them in all sorts of ways , " said stansfield . " if they do accept it , then there are potentially economic benefits and also security benefits . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish demonstrations turned violent late last year andre bank , research fellow at the german institute of global and area studies -lrb- giga -rrb- , traces the new approach to the waning influence of the older elements in the turkish establishment , particularly in the military .
this has minimized the political risk that prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is taking by engaging with barzani .
the turkish government has recently celebrated some foreign policy successes - the nuclear deal with iran and its handling of the israeli attack on the turkish flotilla .
and the government was able to use this domestically . " now , even turkish opposition parties are making efforts to win over turkish-kurd constituencies , " said bank .
" the most obvious example was the recent election of kemal kilicdaroglu , an alevi-kurdish politician , as head of the traditional kemalist and anti-kurdish republican people 's party chp . "
competing for the turkish-kurd vote the kurdish constituency in south-eastern turkey plays a vital part in these foreign relations .
bank believes that the practical affinity between turkish kurds and iraqi kurds is sometimes exaggerated by both sides , as both hanker after a " greater imagined community , " but he admits , " it is true that a majority of the kurdish population in south-eastern turkey have a lot of sympathy with the northern iraqi kurds - there are after all close business connections and family relations across the border . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barzani consolidated his position among iraqi kurds in recent elections as stansfield points out , this turkish-kurd community carries some electoral weight .
" this is not just about the relationship between ankara and kurdish capital arbil , " he said .
" it is about turkey 's relations with its own kurds , and finding a more constructive solution to the kurdish issue in turkey .
that 's particularly important for erdogan 's ruling akp , as they get a lot of their votes from the south-eastern anatolian region . "
but all this comes with the caveat that the turkish political elite continues to fear kurdish separatism .
until recently turkey tried to isolate iraqi kurds , worried that their autonomy , enshrined in the iraqi constitution , would stoke separatism among its own estimated 15 million kurds .
this point is not lost on barzani , whose task in ankara includes assuaging such fears .
the iraqi-kurds ' economy is still fragile , and its dependence on turkish trade is becoming even more essential .
encouraging economies from the iraqi-kurd point-of-view , this week 's high-level talks are underpinned by protecting these economic interests .
" turkey is the lifeline for the kurdish-dominated north of iraq , " said bank .
" it also looks increasingly likely that the kurds will lose their position as king-makers in iraqi politics .
this endangers their potential to control the kirkuk oil fields in the future and makes them even more dependent on economic relations with turkey . "
this political weakness at home is increasing the need to do business across the border , and is helping to bury some old hatchets .

a boost to equal rights , says deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf . the face of success in germany is already feminine .
ever since chancellor angela merkel first took office , germans have gotten used to using the words " woman " and " power " in the same sentence .
of course it has long been evident that women do their job as well or in as mediocre a fashion as their male counterparts do . but powerful women have so far rarely displayed a willingness to back other women .
angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

angela merkel is setting an example .
the chancellor wants to nominate a woman for germany 's top job : labor minister ursula von der leyen would be the one to take over the office of president .
von der leyen would be the 10th german president and the first woman in that position .
it 's about time !
the social democrats and the greens have repeatedly suggested female candidates for the position in bellevue palace , which is the president 's official residence .
gesine schwan was the last such candidate ; she failed to win by a slim margin , which many people regretted . germany in the past has n't exactly been known for championing equal rights , but today , the country boasts many successful women .
there is the chancellor .
there is lena , the radiant winner of the eurovision song contest .
there is steffi graf , one of the most successful tennis players of all times .
there is sarah wiener , a berlin chef cook and successful businesswoman , and of course publicist alice schwarzer , the woman who possibly demanded this development most vehemently of all .
that gives young women in germany role models their mothers could only dream of .
merkel , von der leyen and graf - these examples show young women that fighting for a goal is worthwhile .
these examples also show that allies are important on the way to the top , and that men are prepared to respect women in their jobs - even if that respect has to be earned first .
the 19-year-old eurovison winner lena showed last weekend that women often break established patterns .
far from perfect , super-talented or a vamp , she won people 's hearts across europe .
that , too , is a bit of normalisation in the battle of the sexes . but the delight about the entry of women into the centers of power does n't alter the fact that down below , in the engine rooms as it were , things are pretty glum .
there is movement at the top , but things appear to be set in concrete elsewhere .
in germany , poverty is still a female phenomenon .
men still earn more than women do : last year , the average woman in germany earned 23 percent less per hour than the average man .
the boss is more often than not a man , the nursing staff are women . in the area of gender equality , germany is by no means a role model , no matter how many development surveys and competitive strategies are compiled .
major companies still hide behind ineffective equality concepts .
instead of seeking creative solutions that could break up one-sided career structures , they like to point at women and say , they are not interested .
but of course , in 85 percent of german families , it 's the women who run the household and rear the children .
let 's hope that successful women are n't satisfied with merely having made it themselves .

losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .

presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .

losing the likes of michael ballack , rene adler , simon rolfes , christian traesch and heiko westermann even before a ball was kicked in anger meant that loew only had one player to cut before boarding the plane to south africa .
some pundits have already referred to the squad as being one picked by default .
it goes without saying that loew would much rather have had a fully-fit complement of players to choose from - plus his captain and other first choice stars ready for action - but a closer look at the final squad sheet for south africa reveals not only a list of players with loew 's seal of approval stamped all over it but a selection of stars which has been specifically chosen with surprise and excitement in mind .
few world cup nations choose six strikers in their squad but loew has named cacau , mario gomez , stefan kiessling , miroslav klose , thomas mueller and lukas podolski .
with germany expected play in a 4-2-3-1 formation , it is likely that this highly offensive team plan will include podolski and attacking midfielder mesut oezil , along with either mueller or toni kroos playing behind a lone striker , either klose or cacau .
attacking focus set to surprise and excite the decision to take six strikers to the world cup and play in a formation that requires four attacking players is particularly surprising given germany 's reputation for discipline and efficiency over care-free , creative abandon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new germany captain lahm will command the defense the solidity expected of germany will remain with philipp lahm , per mertesacker , arne friedrich and jerome boateng making up the back four with the protective midfielders sami khedira and bastian schweinsteiger ahead of them .
but the inclusion of so many attacking options suggests loew will be sending out a team to take the game by the scruff of the neck , not slowly throttle the life out of it .
few germany squads in recent memory have entered a tournament with such an emphasis on attack .
australia ghana and serbia may have to rethink their approach to their group d clashes with the germans with die mannschaft set up to stretch , probe and punch their way into the game from the front , rather than to patiently pass their way into scoring positions from deep .
loew makes good on promise of youth the other surprising factor is the age of those charged with the attacking duties .
in fact , germany is probably unique at this world cup for including so many young players with negligible international experience in all areas of the squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller 's first pro season ends with the world cup mesut oezil , 21 , and thomas mueller , 20 , have only ten full germany caps between them - oezil with nine and mueller with a solitary start .
the bayern munich starlet has also only just competed his first full bundesliga season as a professional .
yet both oezil and mueller have shown with their clubs that they can unlock defenses with vision and accuracy at the highest level and , should they make the first team , will be there on merit .
presuming that the two youngsters start , with 23-year old sami khedira stepping into michael ballack 's shoes in midfield and the 23-year old aogo or the 24-year old jansen lining up in defense , joachim loew is certainly making good on his promise to invest in youth at this tournament .
it is also easy to forget due to their experience that bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski are each just 25 .
loew 's cup runneth over outside of the probable starting eleven , loew has fledglings like kroos , holger badstuber and marko marin waiting in the wings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kroos was a force for leverkusen this season the energetic and highly skilled marin is likely to be one of the first pulled off the bench if germany needs a shot in the arm .
kroos is also an exciting talent - one who notched nine goals and 10 assists for leverkusen this past season , and is also able to drop deep to support and cover .
badstuber , a baby-faced defender who looks as though he should be tucked in bed before nine , has just spent a season shutting down some of the best teams in europe .
all can be trusted to come in and do a job in the first team .
rather than taking all he could get and naming the only players still able to walk onto the plane , joachim loew 's germany looks to have been assembled to a specific blueprint : one which could reverse the prejudices attached to german soccer and actually entertain and thrill at the 2010 world cup .

" i know the job , " he says .
" but i have my demands . "
qasab , a 22-year-old pakistani citizen , was given the death sentence recently , and the media is abuzz with reports that the government is struggling to locate a hangman .
hangmen have become scarce in india as the need for them dwindles - there have been only two hangings in the last 15 years ; and the majority of the more than 300 convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life .
reports suggest that there are only one or two hangmen available in india - and mahadeb mullick could be one of the more qualified .
the reason : he belongs to the country 's first family of executioners .
i am sitting in a single-storey concrete shack that is the mullick home on a sliver of a road in a crammed neighbourhood in calcutta .
the place is teeming with noisy children and busy , brisk women going about their chores .
in the midst of this domestic chaos , mahadeb mullick is mulling over my question : to hang or not to hang qasab if there is a request from the authorities .
his credentials for this grisly job are impeccable .
family ' tradition ' nata mullick , his father , died last year after a long " career " during which he executed 25 people .
his grandfather , shib lal mullick , the family says , carried out some 600 hangings , mostly in british-ruled india .
there is no way to verify this claim .
a framed picture on the wall of the stout and neat looking man , who lived between 1889 and 1971 , describes him as " india 's only hangman -lsb- who -rsb- lives on the edge " .
it is a curious eulogy for a long dead man .
his great-grandfather , according to letters available with a family , was also a hangman .
mahadeb mullick says " hanging is in the family 's blood " and he is ready to carry out his first execution .
nata mullick carried out 25 hangings but mr mullick , who holds a day job as a municipal worker , is carrying a grouse against the authorities for treating his father unfairly .
nata mullick became a star after he carried out india 's last hanging in 2004 - a security guard who had murdered and raped a school girl .
the government paid him 10,000 rupees -lrb- $ 213 -rrb- for the job .
news networks lapped up the story with unconcealed glee .
reporters descended on the mullick home , many carrying ropes and towels , asking him to demonstrate his job for the cameras .
as mr mullick demonstrated how to tie a " good noose " around a neck for the cameras , half a dozen children around bengal imitated his moves and accidentally strangled friends and relatives .
an undeterred mr mullick blamed it on the media , while simultaneously revelling in his new found celebrity .
he inaugurated blood donation camps , functions and even acted in a few jatras , or rural theatre , which are immensely popular entertainment in bengal 's villages .
but he was also castigated by a senior ruling communist leader for being feted .
the powerful leader was quoted in the local press exhorting people to stop lionising the hangman .
mahadeb mallick has not forgotten the slight .
" hangmen are used and discarded .
they are stigmatised .
authorities will have to apologise for the things they said against my father , " he says .
" after my father carried out his last hanging , none of the authorities came to our house to find out how we were living .
nobody cares . "
authorities say this is not entirely true - they say that they gave a 10,000 rupees-a-month job to nata mullick 's nephew prabhat mullick as a " sweeper-cum-hangman . "
' trained to hang ' when i meet prabhat , he tells me that he can not carry out an execution because he was never " trained to hang " .
mahadeb mullick says oil and soap is use to make the noose slippery " i went along with my uncle -lsb- nata mullick -rsb- when he carried out his last hanging .
i could not keep my eyes open when the moment arrived , " he says .
with an unwilling and " untrained " executioner in the family the onus has now fallen of mahadeb mullick to carry out executions .
at least , mahadeb says , he is trained .
how does a hangman get trained ?
i ask him .
" oh , you just accompany a hangman and watch a few executions , steel yourself , and carry out a few mock hangings , " he says .
so when nata mullick hanged the security guard in 2004 , he had a retinue of seven assistants , including mahadeb , with him .
mahadeb says he carried out half a dozen " dummy hangings " with a 75kg sandbag figure .
he says he also learnt to make the specially made rope slippery using soap , oil and mashed bananas , how to tie the noose properly , how to put the mask on the convict properly and the right time to open the gallows trapdoor .
he also accompanied nata mullick during the hanging of two men in 1991 .
" it is not an easy job , hanging people .
you need a lot of courage .
you kill with a plan , with a clear head and no tension .
and you can not afford to fail , " mahadeb mullick says .
to top it , the hangman has sometimes to face the ire of the convict at the gallows .
" one of the men we hung in 1991 abused us before we tied the noose around his neck .
he said he would haunt us and destroy my family , " mahadeb mallick says .
" but we have to keep our cool and beg forgiveness .
we have to tell them , ' please forgive us .
i am doing this on the government 's orders ' . "
so if the authorities call on him to carry out qasab 's execution , mahadeb says he will " possibly do it " after some negotiations over pay and a regular allowance .
" but if you ask me , i think qasab should be taken to a zoo and fed to the lions and tigers in front of the tv cameras .
hanging him is too little a punishment . "

mahadeb mullick says oil and soap is use to make the noose slippery " i went along with my uncle -lsb- nata mullick -rsb- when he carried out his last hanging .
i could not keep my eyes open when the moment arrived , " he says .
with an unwilling and " untrained " executioner in the family the onus has now fallen of mahadeb mullick to carry out executions .
at least , mahadeb says , he is trained .
how does a hangman get trained ?
i ask him .
" oh , you just accompany a hangman and watch a few executions , steel yourself , and carry out a few mock hangings , " he says .
so when nata mullick hanged the security guard in 2004 , he had a retinue of seven assistants , including mahadeb , with him .
mahadeb says he carried out half a dozen " dummy hangings " with a 75kg sandbag figure .
he says he also learnt to make the specially made rope slippery using soap , oil and mashed bananas , how to tie the noose properly , how to put the mask on the convict properly and the right time to open the gallows trapdoor .
he also accompanied nata mullick during the hanging of two men in 1991 .
" it is not an easy job , hanging people .
you need a lot of courage .
you kill with a plan , with a clear head and no tension .
and you can not afford to fail , " mahadeb mullick says .
to top it , the hangman has sometimes to face the ire of the convict at the gallows .
" one of the men we hung in 1991 abused us before we tied the noose around his neck .
he said he would haunt us and destroy my family , " mahadeb mallick says .
" but we have to keep our cool and beg forgiveness .
we have to tell them , ' please forgive us .
i am doing this on the government 's orders ' . "
so if the authorities call on him to carry out qasab 's execution , mahadeb says he will " possibly do it " after some negotiations over pay and a regular allowance .
" but if you ask me , i think qasab should be taken to a zoo and fed to the lions and tigers in front of the tv cameras .
hanging him is too little a punishment . "
