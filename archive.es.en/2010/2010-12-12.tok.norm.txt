schaeuble warned speculators not to underestimate the determination of eu states to defend the common currency . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble issued a warning on sunday to financial markets that it would be a mistake to bet against the euro . addressing speculation that debt crises in europe could bring down the currency , schaeuble said european union member states were committed to defending the euro . " whoever bets his money against the euro will not succeed , " schaeuble told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend . the comments came ahead of a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday , where discussions on a permanent crisis fund for the eurozone are set to take place . " the euro will not fail , " said schaeuble .
" all those in charge in europe are agreed , the euro brings us all advantages .
therefore we will successfully defend it . " schaeuble said germany would not abandon the euro because of the benefits of the currency , which is shared by 16 european nations , to the country 's export machine . " without the euro we would experience an appreciation of our own currency with negative consequences for exports , " said the minister . a political union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets have proved jittery over europe 's sovereign debt schaeuble also hinted that there might be a greater degree of political cohesion within the european union in the future . " in 10 years ' time we will have a structure which corresponds far more to what one would call a political union , " schaeuble told the paper . he pointed out that when the common euro currency was introduced , the idea that the currency union could only work in combination with political union had been met with resistance within the eu . " the basic decision was that finance and budget policies are to be set nationally .
if that is to change , we can talk about it , " the minister said . ' no domino effect ' schaeuble also rejected suggestions that the debt crises of greece and ireland would spread across the eurozone . " there will be no domino effect , because we will defend the common currency , " he said adding that to expel some countries from the euro could precipitate a financial crisis of its own . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on sunday , schaeuble criticized speculation that portugal and spain may require a bailout . " i am opposed to all this sort of speculation , " he said , when asked whether the two eurozone members would seek financial aid before the end of the year .
however , he did not deny that such action would be required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble claimed the euro had boosted exports eurozone nations ireland and greece have already accepted emergency rescue funds , and portugal has been expected to follow as borrowing costs there have risen dangerously high . schaeuble also dismissed the suggestion that the eurozone would need to increase its emergency fund . " to save ireland , we did not even use 10 percent of the resources at our disposal , " he said . " that is why we do not need to speculate on the need to increase this fund or not . " crisis will provide ' steps toward further unification ' schaeuble said on friday that european financial turmoil would bring the 27-member eu closer together . " all european countries are determined to keep this european currency stable and we have the means to do it , " he said in an interview published in the online edition of the wall street journal .
" sometimes it takes crises so that europe moves forward .
in this crisis , europe will find steps toward further unification . " an ard survey published on friday found that 60 percent of germans wanted to keep the euro . author : richard connor , martin kuebler -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

khodorkovsky , once russia 's most wealthy businessman , is awaiting the verdict of a second trial on embezzlement and money laundering charges , after being sentenced to eight years in prison on fraud charges in 2003 .
" we believe that the sentence on khodorkovsky will be the sentence on the future .
whatever it is , it will shape our tomorrow , " said olga kurnosova of the oppositional movement united civic front .
in the streets of petersburg , people chanted " freedom for khodorkovsky and lebedev ! " and " the people united will never be defeated ! " while some held up large portraits of the former head of yukos oil company saying " justice is me , " signed " putin " .
khodorkovsky 's supporters see his trial as politically motivated and masterminded by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was president when khodorkovsky was first jailed in 2003 .
his sentence comes to an end next year , but if he is found guilty of the new charges , he faces up to 22 years in prison .
a moscow court will begin reading the verdict on wednesday .

schaeuble warned speculators not to underestimate the determination of eu states to defend the common currency . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble issued a warning on sunday to financial markets that it would be a mistake to bet against the euro . addressing speculation that debt crises in europe could bring down the currency , schaeuble said european union member states were committed to defending the euro . " whoever bets his money against the euro will not succeed , " schaeuble told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend . the comments came ahead of a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday , where discussions on a permanent crisis fund for the eurozone are set to take place . " the euro will not fail , " said schaeuble .
" all those in charge in europe are agreed , the euro brings us all advantages .
therefore we will successfully defend it . " schaeuble said germany would not abandon the euro because of the benefits of the currency , which is shared by 16 european nations , to the country 's export machine . " without the euro we would experience an appreciation of our own currency with negative consequences for exports , " said the minister . a political union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets have proved jittery over europe 's sovereign debt schaeuble also hinted that there might be a greater degree of political cohesion within the european union in the future . " in 10 years ' time we will have a structure which corresponds far more to what one would call a political union , " schaeuble told the paper . he pointed out that when the common euro currency was introduced , the idea that the currency union could only work in combination with political union had been met with resistance within the eu . " the basic decision was that finance and budget policies are to be set nationally .
if that is to change , we can talk about it , " the minister said . ' no domino effect ' schaeuble also rejected suggestions that the debt crises of greece and ireland would spread across the eurozone . " there will be no domino effect , because we will defend the common currency , " he said adding that to expel some countries from the euro could precipitate a financial crisis of its own . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on sunday , schaeuble criticized speculation that portugal and spain may require a bailout . " i am opposed to all this sort of speculation , " he said , when asked whether the two eurozone members would seek financial aid before the end of the year .
however , he did not deny that such action would be required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble claimed the euro had boosted exports eurozone nations ireland and greece have already accepted emergency rescue funds , and portugal has been expected to follow as borrowing costs there have risen dangerously high . schaeuble also dismissed the suggestion that the eurozone would need to increase its emergency fund . " to save ireland , we did not even use 10 percent of the resources at our disposal , " he said . " that is why we do not need to speculate on the need to increase this fund or not . " crisis will provide ' steps toward further unification ' schaeuble said on friday that european financial turmoil would bring the 27-member eu closer together . " all european countries are determined to keep this european currency stable and we have the means to do it , " he said in an interview published in the online edition of the wall street journal .
" sometimes it takes crises so that europe moves forward .
in this crisis , europe will find steps toward further unification . " an ard survey published on friday found that 60 percent of germans wanted to keep the euro . author : richard connor , martin kuebler -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

khodorkovsky , once russia 's most wealthy businessman , is awaiting the verdict of a second trial on embezzlement and money laundering charges , after being sentenced to eight years in prison on fraud charges in 2003 .
" we believe that the sentence on khodorkovsky will be the sentence on the future .
whatever it is , it will shape our tomorrow , " said olga kurnosova of the oppositional movement united civic front .
in the streets of petersburg , people chanted " freedom for khodorkovsky and lebedev ! " and " the people united will never be defeated ! " while some held up large portraits of the former head of yukos oil company saying " justice is me , " signed " putin " .
khodorkovsky 's supporters see his trial as politically motivated and masterminded by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was president when khodorkovsky was first jailed in 2003 .
his sentence comes to an end next year , but if he is found guilty of the new charges , he faces up to 22 years in prison .
a moscow court will begin reading the verdict on wednesday .

schaeuble warned speculators not to underestimate the determination of eu states to defend the common currency . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble issued a warning on sunday to financial markets that it would be a mistake to bet against the euro . addressing speculation that debt crises in europe could bring down the currency , schaeuble said european union member states were committed to defending the euro . " whoever bets his money against the euro will not succeed , " schaeuble told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend . the comments came ahead of a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday , where discussions on a permanent crisis fund for the eurozone are set to take place . " the euro will not fail , " said schaeuble .
" all those in charge in europe are agreed , the euro brings us all advantages .
therefore we will successfully defend it . " schaeuble said germany would not abandon the euro because of the benefits of the currency , which is shared by 16 european nations , to the country 's export machine . " without the euro we would experience an appreciation of our own currency with negative consequences for exports , " said the minister . a political union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets have proved jittery over europe 's sovereign debt schaeuble also hinted that there might be a greater degree of political cohesion within the european union in the future . " in 10 years ' time we will have a structure which corresponds far more to what one would call a political union , " schaeuble told the paper . he pointed out that when the common euro currency was introduced , the idea that the currency union could only work in combination with political union had been met with resistance within the eu . " the basic decision was that finance and budget policies are to be set nationally .
if that is to change , we can talk about it , " the minister said . ' no domino effect ' schaeuble also rejected suggestions that the debt crises of greece and ireland would spread across the eurozone . " there will be no domino effect , because we will defend the common currency , " he said adding that to expel some countries from the euro could precipitate a financial crisis of its own . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on sunday , schaeuble criticized speculation that portugal and spain may require a bailout . " i am opposed to all this sort of speculation , " he said , when asked whether the two eurozone members would seek financial aid before the end of the year .
however , he did not deny that such action would be required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble claimed the euro had boosted exports eurozone nations ireland and greece have already accepted emergency rescue funds , and portugal has been expected to follow as borrowing costs there have risen dangerously high . schaeuble also dismissed the suggestion that the eurozone would need to increase its emergency fund . " to save ireland , we did not even use 10 percent of the resources at our disposal , " he said . " that is why we do not need to speculate on the need to increase this fund or not . " crisis will provide ' steps toward further unification ' schaeuble said on friday that european financial turmoil would bring the 27-member eu closer together . " all european countries are determined to keep this european currency stable and we have the means to do it , " he said in an interview published in the online edition of the wall street journal .
" sometimes it takes crises so that europe moves forward .
in this crisis , europe will find steps toward further unification . " an ard survey published on friday found that 60 percent of germans wanted to keep the euro . author : richard connor , martin kuebler -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

facing the cold war , the us became less interested in punishing nazi criminals as early as 1946 . newly declassified material from the cia and the us military confirm that after world war ii allied intelligence officers protected former nazis and war criminals if they proved useful and cooperative . " undoubtedly , the onset of the cold war gave american intelligence organizations new functions , new priorities , and new foes .
settling scores with germans or german collaborators seemed less pressing ; in some cases , it even appeared counterproductive , " said the report , which was published friday by the us national archives . " despite variations , these specific cases do show a pattern : the issue of capturing and punishing war criminals became less important over time . " the report , titled " hitler 's shadow : nazi war criminals , us intelligence and the cold war , " draws on information classified until 2005 and made available under the nazi war crimes disclosure act , an effort by washington to shed more a critical light on its own secrets . the report looks into a number of former ss and gestapo members who escaped justice with the us either knowingly tolerating their escape or even helping them to flee . auschwitz aide protected from extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the war was over , the cold war created new priorities and new foes rudolf mildner , for instance , was initially arrested in an operation searching for nazis might lead an underground nazi resistance . us authorities knew mildner had long been a gestapo member but never pressed him for details on the gestapo 's crimes against jews or any other groups .
held and questioned in vienna , us officials found him to be " very reliable and cooperative . " a closer look into his past , however , revealed that he had ordered the execution of between 500 and 600 poles at the auschwitz death camp .
confronted with the accusations , mildner confessed and is quoted in the report as having tried to rationalize his actions claiming that " to preserve order and prevent sabotage , the germans in poland and silesia had to do that too . " later , countries including britain and poland requested mildner 's extradition .
but according to the report , " tracking and punishing war criminals were not high among the army 's priorities in late 1946 . " us authorities are believed to have protected him from extradition and even facilitated his escape later to south america , which became a haven for many former nazi war criminals fleeing from justice . hitler 's plans for post-war palestine the newly declassified material also sheds light on nazi germany 's plans in the middle east , where the nazi leadership established close ties with the grand mufti of jerusalem , haj amin al-husseini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : husseini always denied his close ties with nazi germany husseini received substantial financial and logistical support from nazi germany with an eye on using him to control palestine once germany would have defeated britain in the middle east .
husseini and berlin where united mostly by regarding jews as their common enemy . the newly declassified cia and army files establish that the allies knew enough about husseini 's wartime activities to consider him a war criminal .
fearing prosecution , he fled to switzerland , where the country 's authorities handed him over the french . the british government was against husseini being put on trial as it feared political unrest in palestine .
he went on to live in syria and lebanon and always rejected allegations of having had ties with nazi germany .
he claimed he visited berlin only to avoid arrest by the british . ex-nazis employed by western spy agencies earlier this year , germany declassified material from former east german stasi files that detailed how the west german intelligence service drew on having former nazis and war criminals in its rank and file .
the new post-war west german secret service was set up with the help of the allies . as the soviet bloc was the west 's common enemy after 1945 , several historians have said allied authorities widely accepted that former nazis could escape justice if their skills proved useful on the new fronts of the cold war . author : andreas illmer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

khodorkovsky , once russia 's most wealthy businessman , is awaiting the verdict of a second trial on embezzlement and money laundering charges , after being sentenced to eight years in prison on fraud charges in 2003 .
" we believe that the sentence on khodorkovsky will be the sentence on the future .

in the streets of petersburg , people chanted " freedom for khodorkovsky and lebedev ! " and " the people united will never be defeated ! " while some held up large portraits of the former head of yukos oil company saying " justice is me , " signed " putin " .
khodorkovsky 's supporters see his trial as politically motivated and masterminded by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was president when khodorkovsky was first jailed in 2003 .
his sentence comes to an end next year , but if he is found guilty of the new charges , he faces up to 22 years in prison .
a moscow court will begin reading the verdict on wednesday .

schaeuble warned speculators not to underestimate the determination of eu states to defend the common currency . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble issued a warning on sunday to financial markets that it would be a mistake to bet against the euro . addressing speculation that debt crises in europe could bring down the currency , schaeuble said european union member states were committed to defending the euro . " whoever bets his money against the euro will not succeed , " schaeuble told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend . the comments came ahead of a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday , where discussions on a permanent crisis fund for the eurozone are set to take place . " the euro will not fail , " said schaeuble .
" all those in charge in europe are agreed , the euro brings us all advantages .
therefore we will successfully defend it . " schaeuble said germany would not abandon the euro because of the benefits of the currency , which is shared by 16 european nations , to the country 's export machine . " without the euro we would experience an appreciation of our own currency with negative consequences for exports , " said the minister . a political union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets have proved jittery over europe 's sovereign debt schaeuble also hinted that there might be a greater degree of political cohesion within the european union in the future . " in 10 years ' time we will have a structure which corresponds far more to what one would call a political union , " schaeuble told the paper . he pointed out that when the common euro currency was introduced , the idea that the currency union could only work in combination with political union had been met with resistance within the eu . " the basic decision was that finance and budget policies are to be set nationally .
if that is to change , we can talk about it , " the minister said . ' no domino effect ' schaeuble also rejected suggestions that the debt crises of greece and ireland would spread across the eurozone . " there will be no domino effect , because we will defend the common currency , " he said adding that to expel some countries from the euro could precipitate a financial crisis of its own . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on sunday , schaeuble criticized speculation that portugal and spain may require a bailout . " i am opposed to all this sort of speculation , " he said , when asked whether the two eurozone members would seek financial aid before the end of the year .
however , he did not deny that such action would be required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble claimed the euro had boosted exports eurozone nations ireland and greece have already accepted emergency rescue funds , and portugal has been expected to follow as borrowing costs there have risen dangerously high . schaeuble also dismissed the suggestion that the eurozone would need to increase its emergency fund . " to save ireland , we did not even use 10 percent of the resources at our disposal , " he said . " that is why we do not need to speculate on the need to increase this fund or not . " crisis will provide ' steps toward further unification ' schaeuble said on friday that european financial turmoil would bring the 27-member eu closer together . " all european countries are determined to keep this european currency stable and we have the means to do it , " he said in an interview published in the online edition of the wall street journal .
" sometimes it takes crises so that europe moves forward .
in this crisis , europe will find steps toward further unification . " an ard survey published on friday found that 60 percent of germans wanted to keep the euro . author : richard connor , martin kuebler -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

facing the cold war , the us became less interested in punishing nazi criminals as early as 1946 . newly declassified material from the cia and the us military confirm that after world war ii allied intelligence officers protected former nazis and war criminals if they proved useful and cooperative . " undoubtedly , the onset of the cold war gave american intelligence organizations new functions , new priorities , and new foes .
settling scores with germans or german collaborators seemed less pressing ; in some cases , it even appeared counterproductive , " said the report , which was published friday by the us national archives . " despite variations , these specific cases do show a pattern : the issue of capturing and punishing war criminals became less important over time . " the report , titled " hitler 's shadow : nazi war criminals , us intelligence and the cold war , " draws on information classified until 2005 and made available under the nazi war crimes disclosure act , an effort by washington to shed more a critical light on its own secrets . the report looks into a number of former ss and gestapo members who escaped justice with the us either knowingly tolerating their escape or even helping them to flee . auschwitz aide protected from extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the war was over , the cold war created new priorities and new foes rudolf mildner , for instance , was initially arrested in an operation searching for nazis might lead an underground nazi resistance . us authorities knew mildner had long been a gestapo member but never pressed him for details on the gestapo 's crimes against jews or any other groups .
held and questioned in vienna , us officials found him to be " very reliable and cooperative . " a closer look into his past , however , revealed that he had ordered the execution of between 500 and 600 poles at the auschwitz death camp .
confronted with the accusations , mildner confessed and is quoted in the report as having tried to rationalize his actions claiming that " to preserve order and prevent sabotage , the germans in poland and silesia had to do that too . " later , countries including britain and poland requested mildner 's extradition .
but according to the report , " tracking and punishing war criminals were not high among the army 's priorities in late 1946 . " us authorities are believed to have protected him from extradition and even facilitated his escape later to south america , which became a haven for many former nazi war criminals fleeing from justice . hitler 's plans for post-war palestine the newly declassified material also sheds light on nazi germany 's plans in the middle east , where the nazi leadership established close ties with the grand mufti of jerusalem , haj amin al-husseini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : husseini always denied his close ties with nazi germany husseini received substantial financial and logistical support from nazi germany with an eye on using him to control palestine once germany would have defeated britain in the middle east .
husseini and berlin where united mostly by regarding jews as their common enemy . the newly declassified cia and army files establish that the allies knew enough about husseini 's wartime activities to consider him a war criminal .
fearing prosecution , he fled to switzerland , where the country 's authorities handed him over the french . the british government was against husseini being put on trial as it feared political unrest in palestine .
he went on to live in syria and lebanon and always rejected allegations of having had ties with nazi germany .
he claimed he visited berlin only to avoid arrest by the british . ex-nazis employed by western spy agencies earlier this year , germany declassified material from former east german stasi files that detailed how the west german intelligence service drew on having former nazis and war criminals in its rank and file .
the new post-war west german secret service was set up with the help of the allies . as the soviet bloc was the west 's common enemy after 1945 , several historians have said allied authorities widely accepted that former nazis could escape justice if their skills proved useful on the new fronts of the cold war . author : andreas illmer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schaeuble warned speculators not to underestimate the determination of eu states to defend the common currency . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble issued a warning on sunday to financial markets that it would be a mistake to bet against the euro . addressing speculation that debt crises in europe could bring down the currency , schaeuble said european union member states were committed to defending the euro . " whoever bets his money against the euro will not succeed , " schaeuble told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag this weekend . the comments came ahead of a meeting of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday , where discussions on a permanent crisis fund for the eurozone are set to take place . " the euro will not fail , " said schaeuble .
" all those in charge in europe are agreed , the euro brings us all advantages .
therefore we will successfully defend it . " schaeuble said germany would not abandon the euro because of the benefits of the currency , which is shared by 16 european nations , to the country 's export machine . " without the euro we would experience an appreciation of our own currency with negative consequences for exports , " said the minister . a political union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets have proved jittery over europe 's sovereign debt schaeuble also hinted that there might be a greater degree of political cohesion within the european union in the future . " in 10 years ' time we will have a structure which corresponds far more to what one would call a political union , " schaeuble told the paper . he pointed out that when the common euro currency was introduced , the idea that the currency union could only work in combination with political union had been met with resistance within the eu . " the basic decision was that finance and budget policies are to be set nationally .
if that is to change , we can talk about it , " the minister said . ' no domino effect ' schaeuble also rejected suggestions that the debt crises of greece and ireland would spread across the eurozone . " there will be no domino effect , because we will defend the common currency , " he said adding that to expel some countries from the euro could precipitate a financial crisis of its own . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on sunday , schaeuble criticized speculation that portugal and spain may require a bailout . " i am opposed to all this sort of speculation , " he said , when asked whether the two eurozone members would seek financial aid before the end of the year .
however , he did not deny that such action would be required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble claimed the euro had boosted exports eurozone nations ireland and greece have already accepted emergency rescue funds , and portugal has been expected to follow as borrowing costs there have risen dangerously high . schaeuble also dismissed the suggestion that the eurozone would need to increase its emergency fund . " to save ireland , we did not even use 10 percent of the resources at our disposal , " he said . " that is why we do not need to speculate on the need to increase this fund or not . " crisis will provide ' steps toward further unification ' schaeuble said on friday that european financial turmoil would bring the 27-member eu closer together . " all european countries are determined to keep this european currency stable and we have the means to do it , " he said in an interview published in the online edition of the wall street journal .
" sometimes it takes crises so that europe moves forward .
in this crisis , europe will find steps toward further unification . " an ard survey published on friday found that 60 percent of germans wanted to keep the euro . author : richard connor , martin kuebler -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

facing the cold war , the us became less interested in punishing nazi criminals as early as 1946 . newly declassified material from the cia and the us military confirm that after world war ii allied intelligence officers protected former nazis and war criminals if they proved useful and cooperative . " undoubtedly , the onset of the cold war gave american intelligence organizations new functions , new priorities , and new foes .
settling scores with germans or german collaborators seemed less pressing ; in some cases , it even appeared counterproductive , " said the report , which was published friday by the us national archives . " despite variations , these specific cases do show a pattern : the issue of capturing and punishing war criminals became less important over time . " the report , titled " hitler 's shadow : nazi war criminals , us intelligence and the cold war , " draws on information classified until 2005 and made available under the nazi war crimes disclosure act , an effort by washington to shed more a critical light on its own secrets . the report looks into a number of former ss and gestapo members who escaped justice with the us either knowingly tolerating their escape or even helping them to flee . auschwitz aide protected from extradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the war was over , the cold war created new priorities and new foes rudolf mildner , for instance , was initially arrested in an operation searching for nazis might lead an underground nazi resistance . us authorities knew mildner had long been a gestapo member but never pressed him for details on the gestapo 's crimes against jews or any other groups .
held and questioned in vienna , us officials found him to be " very reliable and cooperative . " a closer look into his past , however , revealed that he had ordered the execution of between 500 and 600 poles at the auschwitz death camp .
confronted with the accusations , mildner confessed and is quoted in the report as having tried to rationalize his actions claiming that " to preserve order and prevent sabotage , the germans in poland and silesia had to do that too . " later , countries including britain and poland requested mildner 's extradition .
but according to the report , " tracking and punishing war criminals were not high among the army 's priorities in late 1946 . " us authorities are believed to have protected him from extradition and even facilitated his escape later to south america , which became a haven for many former nazi war criminals fleeing from justice . hitler 's plans for post-war palestine the newly declassified material also sheds light on nazi germany 's plans in the middle east , where the nazi leadership established close ties with the grand mufti of jerusalem , haj amin al-husseini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : husseini always denied his close ties with nazi germany husseini received substantial financial and logistical support from nazi germany with an eye on using him to control palestine once germany would have defeated britain in the middle east .
husseini and berlin where united mostly by regarding jews as their common enemy . the newly declassified cia and army files establish that the allies knew enough about husseini 's wartime activities to consider him a war criminal .
fearing prosecution , he fled to switzerland , where the country 's authorities handed him over the french . the british government was against husseini being put on trial as it feared political unrest in palestine .
he went on to live in syria and lebanon and always rejected allegations of having had ties with nazi germany .
he claimed he visited berlin only to avoid arrest by the british . ex-nazis employed by western spy agencies earlier this year , germany declassified material from former east german stasi files that detailed how the west german intelligence service drew on having former nazis and war criminals in its rank and file .
the new post-war west german secret service was set up with the help of the allies . as the soviet bloc was the west 's common enemy after 1945 , several historians have said allied authorities widely accepted that former nazis could escape justice if their skills proved useful on the new fronts of the cold war . author : andreas illmer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

khodorkovsky , once russia 's most wealthy businessman , is awaiting the verdict of a second trial on embezzlement and money laundering charges , after being sentenced to eight years in prison on fraud charges in 2003 .
" we believe that the sentence on khodorkovsky will be the sentence on the future .
whatever it is , it will shape our tomorrow , " said olga kurnosova of the oppositional movement united civic front .
in the streets of petersburg , people chanted " freedom for khodorkovsky and lebedev ! " and " the people united will never be defeated ! " while some held up large portraits of the former head of yukos oil company saying " justice is me , " signed " putin " .
khodorkovsky 's supporters see his trial as politically motivated and masterminded by russian prime minister vladimir putin , who was president when khodorkovsky was first jailed in 2003 .
his sentence comes to an end next year , but if he is found guilty of the new charges , he faces up to 22 years in prison .
a moscow court will begin reading the verdict on wednesday .
