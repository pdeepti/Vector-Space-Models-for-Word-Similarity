some agree , saying immigrants are n't integrating .
others say the state ca n't fail what it never tried . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .

chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in a speech to supporters , chancellor angela merkel said multiculturalism in germany has not been successful .
party leaders also sparred over immigrants ' role in filling the country 's shortage of skilled workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

" in japan we have a unique opportunity to get everyone - governments , businesses and the public - on board to address the crisis facing life on earth , " said julia marton-lefevre , director general of international union for conservation of nature . the diversity of life on earth was being lost at the fastest rate ever seen , japanese farm minister michihiko kano said ahead of the major international meeting on biodiversity in nagoya , japan , which runs until october 29 . " the loss of biodiversity is developing in the fastest pace ever , " he said .
" it is our responsibility to carry over a rich biodiversity to the next generation . " red alert for species loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 30 percent of amphibians are in danger of extinction delegates to the 193-nation convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- will discuss how to pay for the " equitable sharing " of the benefits from natural resources .
the talks will also attempt to set a new target for preserving plant and animal species threatened by human activity . some 21 percent of all known mammals , 30 percent of known amphibians and 12 percent of known birds are under threat , according to the international union for conservation of nature . habitat loss , hunting and climate change are among the central reasons for the decline in biodiversity . the un named 2010 the international year of biodiversity and one of the un 's millennium development goals calls for " significantly " halting wildlife loss by 2010 . yet it was a goal that no country managed to achieve in the past decade , despite increasing awareness of the extent of the problem . new biodiversity targets the meeting in japan is scheduled to set a new 20-point plan of diversity goals for the next decade . the targets under discussion include cutting pollution , halving the loss and degradation of forests and other natural habitats , making the public aware of nature 's resources and ensuring that agriculture and aquaculture are sustainably managed . the 2020 goals are an improvement over the previous set of goals because they address the root causes of biodiversity loss as well as biodiversity 's sustainable use , according to charles perrings of arizona state university , who led an international team of scientists to develop a strategic approach to the 2020 targets .

ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead .

immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

the french interior minister said that based on the information , " the threat is real . " french interior minister brice hortefeux said on sunday that saudi intelligence services had warned of a new terror threat by al qaeda directed against europe , and in particular france .
" several hours or days ago , there was a new message from the saudis that said al qaeda in the arabian peninsula was without doubt active or planning to be active in europe , notably france , " the minister told french media .
" this is not about overestimating the threat or underestimating it , " hortefeux said .
" i am indicating , based on all these elements , that the threat is real . "
the latest in a series of alerts al qaeda in the arabian peninsula is an arm of al qaeda thought to be based in yemen .
the group has stepped up its activity in recent years as the country is struggling to end a civil war .
in the capital , sanaa , security measures have been stepped up to protect western institutions and embassies .
the warning from saudi arabia of a potential attack by islamist radicals is the latest in a series of alerts that have put french security forces in high-vigilance mode .
hortefeux indicated the fresh warning was not connected with the heightened alert in france in late september .
that was based on a tip-off that a female suicide bomber was planning to attack the transport system .
also in september , the eiffel tower had been evacuated twice over terror alerts .

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

" in japan we have a unique opportunity to get everyone - governments , businesses and the public - on board to address the crisis facing life on earth , " said julia marton-lefevre , director general of international union for conservation of nature . the diversity of life on earth was being lost at the fastest rate ever seen , japanese farm minister michihiko kano said ahead of the major international meeting on biodiversity in nagoya , japan , which runs until october 29 . " the loss of biodiversity is developing in the fastest pace ever , " he said .
" it is our responsibility to carry over a rich biodiversity to the next generation . " red alert for species loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 30 percent of amphibians are in danger of extinction delegates to the 193-nation convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- will discuss how to pay for the " equitable sharing " of the benefits from natural resources .
the talks will also attempt to set a new target for preserving plant and animal species threatened by human activity . some 21 percent of all known mammals , 30 percent of known amphibians and 12 percent of known birds are under threat , according to the international union for conservation of nature . habitat loss , hunting and climate change are among the central reasons for the decline in biodiversity . the un named 2010 the international year of biodiversity and one of the un 's millennium development goals calls for " significantly " halting wildlife loss by 2010 . yet it was a goal that no country managed to achieve in the past decade , despite increasing awareness of the extent of the problem . new biodiversity targets the meeting in japan is scheduled to set a new 20-point plan of diversity goals for the next decade . the targets under discussion include cutting pollution , halving the loss and degradation of forests and other natural habitats , making the public aware of nature 's resources and ensuring that agriculture and aquaculture are sustainably managed . the 2020 goals are an improvement over the previous set of goals because they address the root causes of biodiversity loss as well as biodiversity 's sustainable use , according to charles perrings of arizona state university , who led an international team of scientists to develop a strategic approach to the 2020 targets . " often there are no real instruments for protection , and those that do exist have no teeth , " perrings said of the rules to protect biodiversity .
" there are lots of reasons , reasonable ones , for people making private decisions that lead to biodiversity loss , but they cost us all collectively . " a un-backed study published this month put the international price tag on environmental damaged caused by human activity in 2008 at $ 6.6 trillion -lrb- 4.7 trillion euros -rrb- , or 11 percent of the global gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies say royalties would send up the price of medicine solid scientific data in addition to new goals , the conference will also address the implementation of to a top-level panel to provide policymakers with scientific assessments of biodiversity - similar to those provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- . called ipbes , or intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services , the institution would put a value on the earth 's species at the global and regional level . ipbes ' creation , however , came into doubt in september when developing nations pressed rich countries for payments for the use of genetic " patrimony . " countries rich in diverse plant and animal species , including brazil , india and colombia , are seeking an agreement on access to their genetic assets , and have warned that this issue could be a deal-breaker for other issues at the talks . they want a more equitable system for exploiting discoveries based on their native species or traditional medicines . a protocol on access and benefit sharing could unlock billions of dollars in royalties for them , but pharmaceutical companies , agri-businesses and industrialised nations ' governments are worried that new rules will increase costs and complicate procedures like patent applications . author : sean sinico -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

some agree , saying immigrants are n't integrating .
others say the state ca n't fail what it never tried . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in a speech to supporters , chancellor angela merkel said multiculturalism in germany has not been successful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.10.2010 fast start has dortmund dreaming of first league title run in nine years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin kept the celebrations going against cologne after a weekend that saw a temporary end to this season 's slew of upsets , a resurgent borussia dortmund find themselves top of the table .
and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.10.2010 fast start has dortmund dreaming of first league title run in nine years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin kept the celebrations going against cologne after a weekend that saw a temporary end to this season 's slew of upsets , a resurgent borussia dortmund find themselves top of the table .
and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.10.2010 fast start has dortmund dreaming of first league title run in nine years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin kept the celebrations going against cologne after a weekend that saw a temporary end to this season 's slew of upsets , a resurgent borussia dortmund find themselves top of the table .
and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "

and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .

afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "

besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

france and germany were expected to emphasize that a missile defense plan does not threaten moscow . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy met russian president dmitry medvedev in an effort to seek greater east-west co-operation on defense policy . the summit began over dinner on monday evening in the french resort town of deauville , with details of the discussions to be announced on tuesday . merkel and sarkozy had met earlier in the day to agree their own position before medvedev joined them for talks that were expected to focus on european security issues and russia 's relationship with nato . nato is expected to unveil a new security vision - which would involve a european missile defense shield - at a planned meeting of the alliance in november .
medvedev has not yet said if he will attend that event , but merkel and sarkozy hope the talks in deauville will win russian support for the project . " we will discuss whether it is possible for russia and nato to cooperate better , because the era of the cold war is definitely over , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday . closer ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders will try to show they can cooperate recently , medvedev has come out in support of a new joint european security framework , but russia has been reluctant to support a missile shield , which it fears could target russian cities . another agenda item for the meeting , which an aide for sarkozy described as a " brainstorming session , " is france 's upcoming role as the chair of the g-20 in 2011 when it takes over the reigns from south korea . despite the informal nature of the talks , some of germany and france 's allies are a little miffed at being excluded from the conversation . russia is seen as turning its view more and more to the west , but continues to be at odds with some global powers like the united states on some issues . germany and france , however , enjoy relatively good relations with russia , and the three leaders met in june on the sidelines of the g-20 summit in toronto . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 18.10.2010 pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay 's four founders were convicted in 2009 in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .
the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 18.10.2010 pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay 's four founders were convicted in 2009 in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .
the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked with dw about what inspires his work . dw : " dionysos " in salzburg last summer was the second piece you 've premiered by wolfgang rihm .
what fascinates you about his music ? ingo metzmacher : i think it 's a kind of freedom in his music , a freedom of choice , of flow , of language , and also i think he has a very special dramatic sense .
he has a great sense for music theater , so his music really serves the stage .
that 's something i like very much . the opera is about nietzsche .
how well do you know nietzsche and did that aspect pose a challenge for you ? well , when he told me that he was planning to do an opera about nietzsche 's dionysian poems , i was actually very puzzled .
i didn ’ t understand the texts , and i couldn ’ t imagine how to form an opera from them .
rihm has said the words are by nietzsche , but the text is by him .
that is , he used fragments of points here and there that served his narrative purpose in the piece . he created four different scenes that are very dramatic moments in themselves .
for instance , in the first scene , a woman approaches a man and wants to ask if he loves her or not , but he can not speak .
that 's a very existential scene . did his music and text make it easier for you to understand nietzsche 's message ? yes and no .
again he used very specific fragments .
i think what attracted me is that the language is very enigmatic and open , so you can not pin it down .
you can say that about music too .
you can not claim any kind of music means just this and that .
it 's open to many layers of meaning . so , yes , i learned to read nietzsche differently after rihm wrote the language with the music .
sometimes he repeats the sentences or just words for three or four bars as if the flow of text is somehow stuck , and he uses also parodic elements .
it 's fascinating and a very light approach to the whole subject . bildunterschrift : singer johannes martin kraenzle played dionysos in the opera of the same name you developed an interesting concept called the casual concert during your time in berlin .
can you talk more about that ? yeah , it 's a one and a half hour concert - in jeans - at a much lower price .
there 's free seating and explanations from the stage .
it attracted a younger , enthusiastic audience , and i 'm actually sad to leave that form behind because i really liked it . i think one of your big successes was to create special themes and mottos that got attention . yes , and i had at least four or five more themes in my head which i would have loved to continue to do .
especially the series focusing on 1909 , 1911 , 1913 would have interested me a lot because i think those years before the first world war broke out were very exciting .
you know , artists felt that something was dramatically changing , and you can hear it in the music .
i 'll miss getting to do that . you 're well known as innovative - what drives you to create novel ways of presenting performances ? i found out i have a talent for it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 18.10.2010 pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay 's four founders were convicted in 2009 in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .
the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "

besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .
extensive travel disruptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel reserves are running low an ongoing strike by rail workers continued to disrupt rail travel .
the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .

the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

" in japan we have a unique opportunity to get everyone - governments , businesses and the public - on board to address the crisis facing life on earth , " said julia marton-lefevre , director general of international union for conservation of nature . the diversity of life on earth was being lost at the fastest rate ever seen , japanese farm minister michihiko kano said ahead of the major international meeting on biodiversity in nagoya , japan , which runs until october 29 . " the loss of biodiversity is developing in the fastest pace ever , " he said .
" it is our responsibility to carry over a rich biodiversity to the next generation . " red alert for species loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 30 percent of amphibians are in danger of extinction delegates to the 193-nation convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- will discuss how to pay for the " equitable sharing " of the benefits from natural resources .
the talks will also attempt to set a new target for preserving plant and animal species threatened by human activity . some 21 percent of all known mammals , 30 percent of known amphibians and 12 percent of known birds are under threat , according to the international union for conservation of nature . habitat loss , hunting and climate change are among the central reasons for the decline in biodiversity . the un named 2010 the international year of biodiversity and one of the un 's millennium development goals calls for " significantly " halting wildlife loss by 2010 . yet it was a goal that no country managed to achieve in the past decade , despite increasing awareness of the extent of the problem . new biodiversity targets the meeting in japan is scheduled to set a new 20-point plan of diversity goals for the next decade . the targets under discussion include cutting pollution , halving the loss and degradation of forests and other natural habitats , making the public aware of nature 's resources and ensuring that agriculture and aquaculture are sustainably managed . the 2020 goals are an improvement over the previous set of goals because they address the root causes of biodiversity loss as well as biodiversity 's sustainable use , according to charles perrings of arizona state university , who led an international team of scientists to develop a strategic approach to the 2020 targets . " often there are no real instruments for protection , and those that do exist have no teeth , " perrings said of the rules to protect biodiversity .
" there are lots of reasons , reasonable ones , for people making private decisions that lead to biodiversity loss , but they cost us all collectively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 18.10.2010 berlin announces plans to promote integration and attract skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants would be required to take german classes following claims that multiculturalism has failed , germany has announced plans to promote the integration of immigrants into society .
ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "

the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .

some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

nevertheless , there is neither more , nor less at stake for the junta in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- than the legitimisation of their rule .
perhaps that is the reason for this last public step in an election which critics say is already threatening to turn into a farce .
democracy icon behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi : icon of myanmar 's democratic movement opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest - her party won the elections in 1990 but was never allowed to take power .
suu kyi herself has spent the larger part of the past 20 years in detention .
her current term of house arrest is scheduled to end on november 13 , or a week after the election .
the name of the game 29 million voters will be eligible to vote across 40,000 polling stations , over 3,000 candidates from over 30 parties are contesting the election .
but a quarter of the seats in parliament are reserved for the military , and the election rules are considered to be tilted in favour of the junta 's proxy parties , among them the union solidarity and development party led by prime minister thein sein .
thein sein retired from his military post earlier this year .
and the junta announced last month that voting was being scrapped in parts of the insurgency-plagued ethnic areas , in effect excluding millions from the poll .
the main reason given by election commission chairman thein soe for the exclusion of foreign monitors and media is that " our country has a lot of experience in elections " .
a second reason : diplomats and representatives from un organisations based inside the myanmar will be allowed to observe the voting .
but no photography or filming will be allowed inside the polling stations so that the voters can " cast their votes freely " . ac / afp / reuters editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nevertheless , there is neither more , nor less at stake for the junta in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- than the legitimisation of their rule .
perhaps that is the reason for this last public step in an election which critics say is already threatening to turn into a farce .
democracy icon behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi : icon of myanmar 's democratic movement opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest - her party won the elections in 1990 but was never allowed to take power .
suu kyi herself has spent the larger part of the past 20 years in detention .
her current term of house arrest is scheduled to end on november 13 , or a week after the election .
the name of the game 29 million voters will be eligible to vote across 40,000 polling stations , over 3,000 candidates from over 30 parties are contesting the election .
but a quarter of the seats in parliament are reserved for the military , and the election rules are considered to be tilted in favour of the junta 's proxy parties , among them the union solidarity and development party led by prime minister thein sein .
thein sein retired from his military post earlier this year .
and the junta announced last month that voting was being scrapped in parts of the insurgency-plagued ethnic areas , in effect excluding millions from the poll .
the main reason given by election commission chairman thein soe for the exclusion of foreign monitors and media is that " our country has a lot of experience in elections " .
a second reason : diplomats and representatives from un organisations based inside the myanmar will be allowed to observe the voting .
but no photography or filming will be allowed inside the polling stations so that the voters can " cast their votes freely " . ac / afp / reuters editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 18.10.2010 pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay 's four founders were convicted in 2009 in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .
the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

with this nomination he follows in the footsteps of president hu jintao , whom he is likely to succeed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china ranks second in the world in arms spending the central military commission is one of the most powerful institutions within the chinese political system .
it is also the stepping stone to the country ’ s presidency .
the commission controls the people ’ s liberation army with an estimated troop level of over two million .
the armed forces have an annual budget of approximately 80 billion us dollars - the second highest in the world .
rise of xi jinping many analysts regard this as another indication that xi jinping will take over hu ’ s party post as chairman next year .
hu will have to step down from running the communist party in late 2012 and from the presidency in early 2013 .
xi became the party chief of a village at the age of 21 .
he governed the eastern province of zhejiang for five years and was responsible for the preparations of the 2008 beijing olympics .
since october 2007 , he has been one of the nine members of the standing committee of the party ’ s politburo .
the 57-year-old is the son of former top party member xi zhongxun .
reformist or technocrat ?
xi ’ s father helped to develop china ’ s special economic zones in the mid 1980s and opposed the student protest crackdown on tiananmen square .
based on his father ’ s liberalism , some analysts have speculated that , once he takes power , xi could gradually introduce legal and democratic reforms .
but xi jinping seems more of a technocrat than a reformist .
some observers argue that xi is a bureaucrat who won his promotion by anticipating the wishes of the party ’ s elder generation of leaders .
he is also seen as close to former president jiang zemin .

chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

the french interior minister said that based on the information , " the threat is real . " french interior minister brice hortefeux said on sunday that saudi intelligence services had warned of a new terror threat by al qaeda directed against europe , and in particular france .
" several hours or days ago , there was a new message from the saudis that said al qaeda in the arabian peninsula was without doubt active or planning to be active in europe , notably france , " the minister told french media .
" this is not about overestimating the threat or underestimating it , " hortefeux said .
" i am indicating , based on all these elements , that the threat is real . "
the latest in a series of alerts al qaeda in the arabian peninsula is an arm of al qaeda thought to be based in yemen .
the group has stepped up its activity in recent years as the country is struggling to end a civil war .
in the capital , sanaa , security measures have been stepped up to protect western institutions and embassies .
the warning from saudi arabia of a potential attack by islamist radicals is the latest in a series of alerts that have put french security forces in high-vigilance mode .
hortefeux indicated the fresh warning was not connected with the heightened alert in france in late september .
that was based on a tip-off that a female suicide bomber was planning to attack the transport system .
also in september , the eiffel tower had been evacuated twice over terror alerts .

" initial talks on this issue went well , " offer said , without going into details .
a complex legal tussle between germany and switzerland over tax evasion has been running since the spring , when a series of cds containing evidence of massive tax evasion by germans using swiss bank accounts were sold to the german taxman .
no handouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss banks will protect the names of their customers offer said that the two governments are now planning to sign a double taxation agreement by the end of this month , which will set the protocol for dealing with the hidden money .
but offer denied media reports suggesting that a spectacular deal had been reached , whereby switzerland would hand the german state 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in order to protect its banking secrets .
" speculations about billion-euro return flows to the german state have absolutely no basis , " offer said .
" there are no secret papers either . "
new taxes instead , switzerland will in the future impose a new tax on german banking customers , and revenues will be passed on to berlin .
but the names of the customers will not be handed over .
the two sides are reportedly considering a flat rate tax of 35 percent , 10 percent more than would be payable as capital gains tax in germany .
an agreement has also been proposed for german savings that have been earning interest on investments in swiss bank accounts for years .
according to news magazine focus , the banks will calculate the amount by which the funds have grown in the past 10 years , and will transfer 35 percent of this directly to the german state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandal erupted when a cd containing bank account data was stolen volker wissing , chairman of the german parliament 's financial committee , told the magazine , " there are only winners , except for the tax cheats . "
constructive , but secret , discussions offer commented that the bilateral working group set up in march is aiming to set up a permanent solution to the problem of untaxed capital investments set up by germans in switzerland .
" the initial discussions were constructive , " he said .
" both parties have agreed to keep the details confidential . "
it will be decided in the autumn whether these discussions will lead to formal negotiations , but offer says that the new protocol , which is almost ready to be signed , meets the standards of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in terms of transparency and the effective exchange of information .

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.10.2010 fast start has dortmund dreaming of first league title run in nine years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin kept the celebrations going against cologne after a weekend that saw a temporary end to this season 's slew of upsets , a resurgent borussia dortmund find themselves top of the table .
and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france and germany were expected to emphasize that a missile defense plan does not threaten moscow . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy met russian president dmitry medvedev in an effort to seek greater east-west co-operation on defense policy . the summit began over dinner on monday evening in the french resort town of deauville , with details of the discussions to be announced on tuesday . merkel and sarkozy had met earlier in the day to agree their own position before medvedev joined them for talks that were expected to focus on european security issues and russia 's relationship with nato . nato is expected to unveil a new security vision - which would involve a european missile defense shield - at a planned meeting of the alliance in november .
medvedev has not yet said if he will attend that event , but merkel and sarkozy hope the talks in deauville will win russian support for the project . " we will discuss whether it is possible for russia and nato to cooperate better , because the era of the cold war is definitely over , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday . closer ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders will try to show they can cooperate recently , medvedev has come out in support of a new joint european security framework , but russia has been reluctant to support a missile shield , which it fears could target russian cities . another agenda item for the meeting , which an aide for sarkozy described as a " brainstorming session , " is france 's upcoming role as the chair of the g-20 in 2011 when it takes over the reigns from south korea . despite the informal nature of the talks , some of germany and france 's allies are a little miffed at being excluded from the conversation . russia is seen as turning its view more and more to the west , but continues to be at odds with some global powers like the united states on some issues . germany and france , however , enjoy relatively good relations with russia , and the three leaders met in june on the sidelines of the g-20 summit in toronto . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .

" in japan we have a unique opportunity to get everyone - governments , businesses and the public - on board to address the crisis facing life on earth , " said julia marton-lefevre , director general of international union for conservation of nature . the diversity of life on earth was being lost at the fastest rate ever seen , japanese farm minister michihiko kano said ahead of the major international meeting on biodiversity in nagoya , japan , which runs until october 29 . " the loss of biodiversity is developing in the fastest pace ever , " he said .
" it is our responsibility to carry over a rich biodiversity to the next generation . " red alert for species loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 30 percent of amphibians are in danger of extinction delegates to the 193-nation convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- will discuss how to pay for the " equitable sharing " of the benefits from natural resources .
the talks will also attempt to set a new target for preserving plant and animal species threatened by human activity . some 21 percent of all known mammals , 30 percent of known amphibians and 12 percent of known birds are under threat , according to the international union for conservation of nature . habitat loss , hunting and climate change are among the central reasons for the decline in biodiversity . the un named 2010 the international year of biodiversity and one of the un 's millennium development goals calls for " significantly " halting wildlife loss by 2010 . yet it was a goal that no country managed to achieve in the past decade , despite increasing awareness of the extent of the problem . new biodiversity targets the meeting in japan is scheduled to set a new 20-point plan of diversity goals for the next decade . the targets under discussion include cutting pollution , halving the loss and degradation of forests and other natural habitats , making the public aware of nature 's resources and ensuring that agriculture and aquaculture are sustainably managed . the 2020 goals are an improvement over the previous set of goals because they address the root causes of biodiversity loss as well as biodiversity 's sustainable use , according to charles perrings of arizona state university , who led an international team of scientists to develop a strategic approach to the 2020 targets . " often there are no real instruments for protection , and those that do exist have no teeth , " perrings said of the rules to protect biodiversity .
" there are lots of reasons , reasonable ones , for people making private decisions that lead to biodiversity loss , but they cost us all collectively . " a un-backed study published this month put the international price tag on environmental damaged caused by human activity in 2008 at $ 6.6 trillion -lrb- 4.7 trillion euros -rrb- , or 11 percent of the global gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies say royalties would send up the price of medicine solid scientific data in addition to new goals , the conference will also address the implementation of to a top-level panel to provide policymakers with scientific assessments of biodiversity - similar to those provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- . called ipbes , or intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services , the institution would put a value on the earth 's species at the global and regional level . ipbes ' creation , however , came into doubt in september when developing nations pressed rich countries for payments for the use of genetic " patrimony .

he talked with dw about what inspires his work . dw : " dionysos " in salzburg last summer was the second piece you 've premiered by wolfgang rihm .
what fascinates you about his music ? ingo metzmacher : i think it 's a kind of freedom in his music , a freedom of choice , of flow , of language , and also i think he has a very special dramatic sense .
he has a great sense for music theater , so his music really serves the stage .
that 's something i like very much . the opera is about nietzsche .
how well do you know nietzsche and did that aspect pose a challenge for you ? well , when he told me that he was planning to do an opera about nietzsche 's dionysian poems , i was actually very puzzled .
i didn ’ t understand the texts , and i couldn ’ t imagine how to form an opera from them .
rihm has said the words are by nietzsche , but the text is by him .
that is , he used fragments of points here and there that served his narrative purpose in the piece . he created four different scenes that are very dramatic moments in themselves .
for instance , in the first scene , a woman approaches a man and wants to ask if he loves her or not , but he can not speak .
that 's a very existential scene . did his music and text make it easier for you to understand nietzsche 's message ? yes and no .
again he used very specific fragments .
i think what attracted me is that the language is very enigmatic and open , so you can not pin it down .
you can say that about music too .
you can not claim any kind of music means just this and that .
it 's open to many layers of meaning . so , yes , i learned to read nietzsche differently after rihm wrote the language with the music .
sometimes he repeats the sentences or just words for three or four bars as if the flow of text is somehow stuck , and he uses also parodic elements .
it 's fascinating and a very light approach to the whole subject . bildunterschrift : singer johannes martin kraenzle played dionysos in the opera of the same name you developed an interesting concept called the casual concert during your time in berlin .
can you talk more about that ? yeah , it 's a one and a half hour concert - in jeans - at a much lower price .
there 's free seating and explanations from the stage .
it attracted a younger , enthusiastic audience , and i 'm actually sad to leave that form behind because i really liked it . i think one of your big successes was to create special themes and mottos that got attention . yes , and i had at least four or five more themes in my head which i would have loved to continue to do .
especially the series focusing on 1909 , 1911 , 1913 would have interested me a lot because i think those years before the first world war broke out were very exciting .
you know , artists felt that something was dramatically changing , and you can hear it in the music .
i 'll miss getting to do that . you 're well known as innovative - what drives you to create novel ways of presenting performances ? i found out i have a talent for it .
i like to communicate my enthusiasm for any kind of music actually , but i realized that there seems to be a vacuum .
audiences really like to be approached to have some help opening up their ears . interview : gero schliess -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael steiner , germany 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan ' hype ' about negotiations with the taliban the election and its outcome was one of the issues on the agenda of the afghanistan international contact group in rome on monday .
besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 18.10.2010 berlin announces plans to promote integration and attract skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants would be required to take german classes following claims that multiculturalism has failed , germany has announced plans to promote the integration of immigrants into society .
ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .
extensive travel disruptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel reserves are running low an ongoing strike by rail workers continued to disrupt rail travel .
the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .
" the government is in control , " industry minister christian estrosi told rtl radio .
" there will be no blockade for companies , no blockade for transport and no blockade for road users . " on monday , the government activated an emergency government crisis unit charged with maintaining fuel supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is confident his reforms will pass bill expected to pass protesters want to force sarkozy to abandon a proposed law that would raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and bring the full retirement age to 67 . his center-right government says the measure is the only way to get the bloated pension deficit under control .
the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

france and germany were expected to emphasize that a missile defense plan does not threaten moscow . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy met russian president dmitry medvedev in an effort to seek greater east-west co-operation on defense policy . the summit began over dinner on monday evening in the french resort town of deauville , with details of the discussions to be announced on tuesday . merkel and sarkozy had met earlier in the day to agree their own position before medvedev joined them for talks that were expected to focus on european security issues and russia 's relationship with nato . nato is expected to unveil a new security vision - which would involve a european missile defense shield - at a planned meeting of the alliance in november .
medvedev has not yet said if he will attend that event , but merkel and sarkozy hope the talks in deauville will win russian support for the project . " we will discuss whether it is possible for russia and nato to cooperate better , because the era of the cold war is definitely over , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday . closer ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders will try to show they can cooperate recently , medvedev has come out in support of a new joint european security framework , but russia has been reluctant to support a missile shield , which it fears could target russian cities . another agenda item for the meeting , which an aide for sarkozy described as a " brainstorming session , " is france 's upcoming role as the chair of the g-20 in 2011 when it takes over the reigns from south korea . despite the informal nature of the talks , some of germany and france 's allies are a little miffed at being excluded from the conversation . russia is seen as turning its view more and more to the west , but continues to be at odds with some global powers like the united states on some issues . germany and france , however , enjoy relatively good relations with russia , and the three leaders met in june on the sidelines of the g-20 summit in toronto . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in japan we have a unique opportunity to get everyone - governments , businesses and the public - on board to address the crisis facing life on earth , " said julia marton-lefevre , director general of international union for conservation of nature . the diversity of life on earth was being lost at the fastest rate ever seen , japanese farm minister michihiko kano said ahead of the major international meeting on biodiversity in nagoya , japan , which runs until october 29 . " the loss of biodiversity is developing in the fastest pace ever , " he said .
" it is our responsibility to carry over a rich biodiversity to the next generation . " red alert for species loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 30 percent of amphibians are in danger of extinction delegates to the 193-nation convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- will discuss how to pay for the " equitable sharing " of the benefits from natural resources .
the talks will also attempt to set a new target for preserving plant and animal species threatened by human activity . some 21 percent of all known mammals , 30 percent of known amphibians and 12 percent of known birds are under threat , according to the international union for conservation of nature . habitat loss , hunting and climate change are among the central reasons for the decline in biodiversity . the un named 2010 the international year of biodiversity and one of the un 's millennium development goals calls for " significantly " halting wildlife loss by 2010 . yet it was a goal that no country managed to achieve in the past decade , despite increasing awareness of the extent of the problem . new biodiversity targets the meeting in japan is scheduled to set a new 20-point plan of diversity goals for the next decade . the targets under discussion include cutting pollution , halving the loss and degradation of forests and other natural habitats , making the public aware of nature 's resources and ensuring that agriculture and aquaculture are sustainably managed . the 2020 goals are an improvement over the previous set of goals because they address the root causes of biodiversity loss as well as biodiversity 's sustainable use , according to charles perrings of arizona state university , who led an international team of scientists to develop a strategic approach to the 2020 targets . " often there are no real instruments for protection , and those that do exist have no teeth , " perrings said of the rules to protect biodiversity .
" there are lots of reasons , reasonable ones , for people making private decisions that lead to biodiversity loss , but they cost us all collectively . " a un-backed study published this month put the international price tag on environmental damaged caused by human activity in 2008 at $ 6.6 trillion -lrb- 4.7 trillion euros -rrb- , or 11 percent of the global gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies say royalties would send up the price of medicine solid scientific data in addition to new goals , the conference will also address the implementation of to a top-level panel to provide policymakers with scientific assessments of biodiversity - similar to those provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- . called ipbes , or intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services , the institution would put a value on the earth 's species at the global and regional level . ipbes ' creation , however , came into doubt in september when developing nations pressed rich countries for payments for the use of genetic " patrimony . " countries rich in diverse plant and animal species , including brazil , india and colombia , are seeking an agreement on access to their genetic assets , and have warned that this issue could be a deal-breaker for other issues at the talks . they want a more equitable system for exploiting discoveries based on their native species or traditional medicines . a protocol on access and benefit sharing could unlock billions of dollars in royalties for them , but pharmaceutical companies , agri-businesses and industrialised nations ' governments are worried that new rules will increase costs and complicate procedures like patent applications . author : sean sinico -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 18.10.2010 swiss and germans close to resolution over tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tax cheats are likely to avoid prosecution the conflict between switzerland and germany over germans who hide money in swiss banks to avoid taxation could be nearing a resolution , the german finance ministry announced at the weekend . germans who use swiss banks to keep fortunes from the german state may soon be facing hefty new tax bills from the swiss authorities - but will avoid prosecution in germany , according to michael offer , spokesman for the german finance ministry .
" initial talks on this issue went well , " offer said , without going into details .
a complex legal tussle between germany and switzerland over tax evasion has been running since the spring , when a series of cds containing evidence of massive tax evasion by germans using swiss bank accounts were sold to the german taxman .
no handouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss banks will protect the names of their customers offer said that the two governments are now planning to sign a double taxation agreement by the end of this month , which will set the protocol for dealing with the hidden money .
but offer denied media reports suggesting that a spectacular deal had been reached , whereby switzerland would hand the german state 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in order to protect its banking secrets .
" speculations about billion-euro return flows to the german state have absolutely no basis , " offer said .
" there are no secret papers either . "
new taxes instead , switzerland will in the future impose a new tax on german banking customers , and revenues will be passed on to berlin .
but the names of the customers will not be handed over .
the two sides are reportedly considering a flat rate tax of 35 percent , 10 percent more than would be payable as capital gains tax in germany .
an agreement has also been proposed for german savings that have been earning interest on investments in swiss bank accounts for years .
according to news magazine focus , the banks will calculate the amount by which the funds have grown in the past 10 years , and will transfer 35 percent of this directly to the german state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandal erupted when a cd containing bank account data was stolen volker wissing , chairman of the german parliament 's financial committee , told the magazine , " there are only winners , except for the tax cheats . "
constructive , but secret , discussions offer commented that the bilateral working group set up in march is aiming to set up a permanent solution to the problem of untaxed capital investments set up by germans in switzerland .
" the initial discussions were constructive , " he said .
" both parties have agreed to keep the details confidential . "
it will be decided in the autumn whether these discussions will lead to formal negotiations , but offer says that the new protocol , which is almost ready to be signed , meets the standards of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in terms of transparency and the effective exchange of information .

" initial talks on this issue went well , " offer said , without going into details .
a complex legal tussle between germany and switzerland over tax evasion has been running since the spring , when a series of cds containing evidence of massive tax evasion by germans using swiss bank accounts were sold to the german taxman .
no handouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss banks will protect the names of their customers offer said that the two governments are now planning to sign a double taxation agreement by the end of this month , which will set the protocol for dealing with the hidden money .
but offer denied media reports suggesting that a spectacular deal had been reached , whereby switzerland would hand the german state 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in order to protect its banking secrets .
" speculations about billion-euro return flows to the german state have absolutely no basis , " offer said .
" there are no secret papers either . "
new taxes instead , switzerland will in the future impose a new tax on german banking customers , and revenues will be passed on to berlin .
but the names of the customers will not be handed over .
the two sides are reportedly considering a flat rate tax of 35 percent , 10 percent more than would be payable as capital gains tax in germany .
an agreement has also been proposed for german savings that have been earning interest on investments in swiss bank accounts for years .
according to news magazine focus , the banks will calculate the amount by which the funds have grown in the past 10 years , and will transfer 35 percent of this directly to the german state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandal erupted when a cd containing bank account data was stolen volker wissing , chairman of the german parliament 's financial committee , told the magazine , " there are only winners , except for the tax cheats . "
constructive , but secret , discussions offer commented that the bilateral working group set up in march is aiming to set up a permanent solution to the problem of untaxed capital investments set up by germans in switzerland .
" the initial discussions were constructive , " he said .
" both parties have agreed to keep the details confidential . "
it will be decided in the autumn whether these discussions will lead to formal negotiations , but offer says that the new protocol , which is almost ready to be signed , meets the standards of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in terms of transparency and the effective exchange of information .

and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic .

and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .
extensive travel disruptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel reserves are running low an ongoing strike by rail workers continued to disrupt rail travel .
the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .
" the government is in control , " industry minister christian estrosi told rtl radio .
" there will be no blockade for companies , no blockade for transport and no blockade for road users . " on monday , the government activated an emergency government crisis unit charged with maintaining fuel supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is confident his reforms will pass bill expected to pass protesters want to force sarkozy to abandon a proposed law that would raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and bring the full retirement age to 67 . his center-right government says the measure is the only way to get the bloated pension deficit under control .
the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

some agree , saying immigrants are n't integrating .
others say the state ca n't fail what it never tried . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.10.2010 fast start has dortmund dreaming of first league title run in nine years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin kept the celebrations going against cologne after a weekend that saw a temporary end to this season 's slew of upsets , a resurgent borussia dortmund find themselves top of the table .
and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead .

" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .
extensive travel disruptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel reserves are running low an ongoing strike by rail workers continued to disrupt rail travel .
the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

with this nomination he follows in the footsteps of president hu jintao , whom he is likely to succeed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china ranks second in the world in arms spending the central military commission is one of the most powerful institutions within the chinese political system .
it is also the stepping stone to the country ’ s presidency .
the commission controls the people ’ s liberation army with an estimated troop level of over two million .
the armed forces have an annual budget of approximately 80 billion us dollars - the second highest in the world .
rise of xi jinping many analysts regard this as another indication that xi jinping will take over hu ’ s party post as chairman next year .
hu will have to step down from running the communist party in late 2012 and from the presidency in early 2013 .
xi became the party chief of a village at the age of 21 .
he governed the eastern province of zhejiang for five years and was responsible for the preparations of the 2008 beijing olympics .
since october 2007 , he has been one of the nine members of the standing committee of the party ’ s politburo .
the 57-year-old is the son of former top party member xi zhongxun .
reformist or technocrat ?
xi ’ s father helped to develop china ’ s special economic zones in the mid 1980s and opposed the student protest crackdown on tiananmen square .
based on his father ’ s liberalism , some analysts have speculated that , once he takes power , xi could gradually introduce legal and democratic reforms .
but xi jinping seems more of a technocrat than a reformist .
some observers argue that xi is a bureaucrat who won his promotion by anticipating the wishes of the party ’ s elder generation of leaders .
he is also seen as close to former president jiang zemin .

acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in japan we have a unique opportunity to get everyone - governments , businesses and the public - on board to address the crisis facing life on earth , " said julia marton-lefevre , director general of international union for conservation of nature . the diversity of life on earth was being lost at the fastest rate ever seen , japanese farm minister michihiko kano said ahead of the major international meeting on biodiversity in nagoya , japan , which runs until october 29 . " the loss of biodiversity is developing in the fastest pace ever , " he said .
" it is our responsibility to carry over a rich biodiversity to the next generation . " red alert for species loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 30 percent of amphibians are in danger of extinction delegates to the 193-nation convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- will discuss how to pay for the " equitable sharing " of the benefits from natural resources .
the talks will also attempt to set a new target for preserving plant and animal species threatened by human activity . some 21 percent of all known mammals , 30 percent of known amphibians and 12 percent of known birds are under threat , according to the international union for conservation of nature . habitat loss , hunting and climate change are among the central reasons for the decline in biodiversity . the un named 2010 the international year of biodiversity and one of the un 's millennium development goals calls for " significantly " halting wildlife loss by 2010 . yet it was a goal that no country managed to achieve in the past decade , despite increasing awareness of the extent of the problem . new biodiversity targets the meeting in japan is scheduled to set a new 20-point plan of diversity goals for the next decade . the targets under discussion include cutting pollution , halving the loss and degradation of forests and other natural habitats , making the public aware of nature 's resources and ensuring that agriculture and aquaculture are sustainably managed . the 2020 goals are an improvement over the previous set of goals because they address the root causes of biodiversity loss as well as biodiversity 's sustainable use , according to charles perrings of arizona state university , who led an international team of scientists to develop a strategic approach to the 2020 targets . " often there are no real instruments for protection , and those that do exist have no teeth , " perrings said of the rules to protect biodiversity .
" there are lots of reasons , reasonable ones , for people making private decisions that lead to biodiversity loss , but they cost us all collectively . " a un-backed study published this month put the international price tag on environmental damaged caused by human activity in 2008 at $ 6.6 trillion -lrb- 4.7 trillion euros -rrb- , or 11 percent of the global gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies say royalties would send up the price of medicine solid scientific data in addition to new goals , the conference will also address the implementation of to a top-level panel to provide policymakers with scientific assessments of biodiversity - similar to those provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- . called ipbes , or intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services , the institution would put a value on the earth 's species at the global and regional level . ipbes ' creation , however , came into doubt in september when developing nations pressed rich countries for payments for the use of genetic " patrimony .

with this nomination he follows in the footsteps of president hu jintao , whom he is likely to succeed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china ranks second in the world in arms spending the central military commission is one of the most powerful institutions within the chinese political system .
it is also the stepping stone to the country ’ s presidency .
the commission controls the people ’ s liberation army with an estimated troop level of over two million .
the armed forces have an annual budget of approximately 80 billion us dollars - the second highest in the world .
rise of xi jinping many analysts regard this as another indication that xi jinping will take over hu ’ s party post as chairman next year .
hu will have to step down from running the communist party in late 2012 and from the presidency in early 2013 .
xi became the party chief of a village at the age of 21 .
he governed the eastern province of zhejiang for five years and was responsible for the preparations of the 2008 beijing olympics .
since october 2007 , he has been one of the nine members of the standing committee of the party ’ s politburo .
the 57-year-old is the son of former top party member xi zhongxun .
reformist or technocrat ?
xi ’ s father helped to develop china ’ s special economic zones in the mid 1980s and opposed the student protest crackdown on tiananmen square .
based on his father ’ s liberalism , some analysts have speculated that , once he takes power , xi could gradually introduce legal and democratic reforms .
but xi jinping seems more of a technocrat than a reformist .
some observers argue that xi is a bureaucrat who won his promotion by anticipating the wishes of the party ’ s elder generation of leaders .
he is also seen as close to former president jiang zemin .

china has tried to foster domestic demand recently in order to become more independent from its exports .
the chinese leadership also stated that the next five years would be " a time of difficult issues for deepening the reform and opening process " .

the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 18.10.2010 pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay 's four founders were convicted in 2009 in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .
the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

france and germany were expected to emphasize that a missile defense plan does not threaten moscow . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy met russian president dmitry medvedev in an effort to seek greater east-west co-operation on defense policy . the summit began over dinner on monday evening in the french resort town of deauville , with details of the discussions to be announced on tuesday . merkel and sarkozy had met earlier in the day to agree their own position before medvedev joined them for talks that were expected to focus on european security issues and russia 's relationship with nato . nato is expected to unveil a new security vision - which would involve a european missile defense shield - at a planned meeting of the alliance in november .
medvedev has not yet said if he will attend that event , but merkel and sarkozy hope the talks in deauville will win russian support for the project . " we will discuss whether it is possible for russia and nato to cooperate better , because the era of the cold war is definitely over , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday . closer ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders will try to show they can cooperate recently , medvedev has come out in support of a new joint european security framework , but russia has been reluctant to support a missile shield , which it fears could target russian cities . another agenda item for the meeting , which an aide for sarkozy described as a " brainstorming session , " is france 's upcoming role as the chair of the g-20 in 2011 when it takes over the reigns from south korea . despite the informal nature of the talks , some of germany and france 's allies are a little miffed at being excluded from the conversation . russia is seen as turning its view more and more to the west , but continues to be at odds with some global powers like the united states on some issues . germany and france , however , enjoy relatively good relations with russia , and the three leaders met in june on the sidelines of the g-20 summit in toronto . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 18.10.2010 berlin announces plans to promote integration and attract skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants would be required to take german classes following claims that multiculturalism has failed , germany has announced plans to promote the integration of immigrants into society .
ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

france and germany were expected to emphasize that a missile defense plan does not threaten moscow . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy met russian president dmitry medvedev in an effort to seek greater east-west co-operation on defense policy . the summit began over dinner on monday evening in the french resort town of deauville , with details of the discussions to be announced on tuesday . merkel and sarkozy had met earlier in the day to agree their own position before medvedev joined them for talks that were expected to focus on european security issues and russia 's relationship with nato . nato is expected to unveil a new security vision - which would involve a european missile defense shield - at a planned meeting of the alliance in november .
medvedev has not yet said if he will attend that event , but merkel and sarkozy hope the talks in deauville will win russian support for the project . " we will discuss whether it is possible for russia and nato to cooperate better , because the era of the cold war is definitely over , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday . closer ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders will try to show they can cooperate recently , medvedev has come out in support of a new joint european security framework , but russia has been reluctant to support a missile shield , which it fears could target russian cities . another agenda item for the meeting , which an aide for sarkozy described as a " brainstorming session , " is france 's upcoming role as the chair of the g-20 in 2011 when it takes over the reigns from south korea . despite the informal nature of the talks , some of germany and france 's allies are a little miffed at being excluded from the conversation . russia is seen as turning its view more and more to the west , but continues to be at odds with some global powers like the united states on some issues . germany and france , however , enjoy relatively good relations with russia , and the three leaders met in june on the sidelines of the g-20 summit in toronto . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .

the country is deeply divided between its flemish and french-speaking populations . the political crisis in belgium looks set to deepen as the country 's french speaking political parties have rejected a coalition proposal from the flemish separatist n-va party , which had emerged as the strongest party in parliamentary elections in june .

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .
extensive travel disruptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel reserves are running low an ongoing strike by rail workers continued to disrupt rail travel .
the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .
" the government is in control , " industry minister christian estrosi told rtl radio .
" there will be no blockade for companies , no blockade for transport and no blockade for road users . " on monday , the government activated an emergency government crisis unit charged with maintaining fuel supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is confident his reforms will pass bill expected to pass protesters want to force sarkozy to abandon a proposed law that would raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and bring the full retirement age to 67 . his center-right government says the measure is the only way to get the bloated pension deficit under control .
the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

after an award-winning year and performances at the salzburger festspiele , the singer talks with dw about what inspires her singing . deutsche welle : your career has led you to many important stages in the world but not to germany .
why is that ? joyce didonato : well , when i started auditioning , my first jobs were in paris , london , milan and amsterdam .
after i would sing there , they invited me back immediately , and my schedule quickly filled up with repeat performances .
now , i have a really strong relationship with the public , especially in paris and london . i did do a very quick and inconsequential debut in munich years ago , but i doubt anyone remembers it .
but i plan to come back many times now .
i 'll be making my debut in berlin this year , so i 'm finally catching up with the rest of the world when it comes to germany . germany 's echo award jury named you classical singer of the year in 2010 for your operatic work .
your focus has been on italian operas - how did that come about ? i have the great fortune of having a voice that has some flexibility to it .
rossini was a very obvious and good match for me .
he also led me to handel and then to the bigger bel canto repertoire . what i 've learned as a musician and artist by singing these composers is tremendous .
there 's nothing worse than this kind of music just being sung as a vocalese with all of the notes in place but not really coming alive .
so i 've had to work very hard to find the ways of making this music important .
my latest cd explored the dramatic side of rossini , and i found a treasure trove of richness and complexity in his writing and characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rossini should give listeners a certain bubbly sensation , said didonato is italian opera more demanding for you than singing parts from other operatic traditions ? it 's all demanding . -lsb- laughs -rsb- i did n't pick an easy profession . rossini needs to sound like champagne and sound easy - like fireworks just coming out of your mouth - but it takes a lot of work to make that happen .
on the other hand , i 'm singing octavian -lsb- in richard strauss ' " der rosenkavalier " -rsb- this year in madrid , and it 's a tremendous amount of work for me in terms of the language and finding all of those little turns in the character .
so , i find it all challenging but , as a result , rewarding . are these aspects of rossini 's work that you described also part of your personality ? i think they are in some ways .
i have some complexity to me that is not only supported by rossini - there 's some mahler in there too . the only possibility to succeed is to be present in the moment .
if i 'm thinking about the final aria when i start the opera , there 's no way i 'll have a good performance .
really , the only way to create a real character is to be fully in the moment , and that 's something i 've tried to bring into my life . this year at the salzburg festival you performed with one of classical music 's icons , edita gruberova .
what was it like to share the stage with her ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edita gruberova -lrb- pictured -rrb- performed with didonato this year in bellini 's " norma " when i started getting interested in opera - which happened a bit late for me , in my early 20s - she was one of the big names .
she stands at the very top of the legendary singers , and i 'm also not one to bemoan the fact that the golden age of singing is behind us .
we 're living in an exciting age of singers ; however , there is this legendary group of bel canto singers , and gruberova is one of the last in this line of truly exceptional artists . the artists interest me much more than the singers .
i like a pretty sound as much as anyone .
but i want someone who is bleeding on the stage and giving everything , and she does that .
i was a bit intimidated when we started rehearsing , but from the first moment , she made me feel very much at home . interview : gero schliess -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .

chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .

i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .

when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 18.10.2010 pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay 's four founders were convicted in 2009 in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .
the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "

besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 18.10.2010 berlin announces plans to promote integration and attract skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants would be required to take german classes following claims that multiculturalism has failed , germany has announced plans to promote the integration of immigrants into society .
ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead .

" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.10.2010 fast start has dortmund dreaming of first league title run in nine years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin kept the celebrations going against cologne after a weekend that saw a temporary end to this season 's slew of upsets , a resurgent borussia dortmund find themselves top of the table .
and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .
extensive travel disruptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel reserves are running low an ongoing strike by rail workers continued to disrupt rail travel .
the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .
" the government is in control , " industry minister christian estrosi told rtl radio .
" there will be no blockade for companies , no blockade for transport and no blockade for road users . " on monday , the government activated an emergency government crisis unit charged with maintaining fuel supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is confident his reforms will pass bill expected to pass protesters want to force sarkozy to abandon a proposed law that would raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and bring the full retirement age to 67 . his center-right government says the measure is the only way to get the bloated pension deficit under control .
the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

france and germany were expected to emphasize that a missile defense plan does not threaten moscow . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy met russian president dmitry medvedev in an effort to seek greater east-west co-operation on defense policy . the summit began over dinner on monday evening in the french resort town of deauville , with details of the discussions to be announced on tuesday . merkel and sarkozy had met earlier in the day to agree their own position before medvedev joined them for talks that were expected to focus on european security issues and russia 's relationship with nato . nato is expected to unveil a new security vision - which would involve a european missile defense shield - at a planned meeting of the alliance in november .
medvedev has not yet said if he will attend that event , but merkel and sarkozy hope the talks in deauville will win russian support for the project . " we will discuss whether it is possible for russia and nato to cooperate better , because the era of the cold war is definitely over , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday . closer ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders will try to show they can cooperate recently , medvedev has come out in support of a new joint european security framework , but russia has been reluctant to support a missile shield , which it fears could target russian cities . another agenda item for the meeting , which an aide for sarkozy described as a " brainstorming session , " is france 's upcoming role as the chair of the g-20 in 2011 when it takes over the reigns from south korea . despite the informal nature of the talks , some of germany and france 's allies are a little miffed at being excluded from the conversation . russia is seen as turning its view more and more to the west , but continues to be at odds with some global powers like the united states on some issues . germany and france , however , enjoy relatively good relations with russia , and the three leaders met in june on the sidelines of the g-20 summit in toronto . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.10.2010 fast start has dortmund dreaming of first league title run in nine years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin kept the celebrations going against cologne after a weekend that saw a temporary end to this season 's slew of upsets , a resurgent borussia dortmund find themselves top of the table .
and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .

dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .

the country is deeply divided between its flemish and french-speaking populations . the political crisis in belgium looks set to deepen as the country 's french speaking political parties have rejected a coalition proposal from the flemish separatist n-va party , which had emerged as the strongest party in parliamentary elections in june . "
fabula acta est -lrb- the play is over -rrb- , " n-va leader bart de wever said in latin in a reaction to the francophone side 's rejection of his draft proposal . on sunday , de wever 's party presented a compromise proposal to form a seven-party coalition .

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 18.10.2010 think tank report urges eu to reconsider chosen security strategies 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report suggests a different triumverate on eu security pan-european security cooperation will top the agenda at the deauville summit between the leaders of germany , france and russia but while the topic is a pressing one , are they the right people to be talking about it ? german chancellor angela merkel is attending the annual two-day deauville summit starting monday to hold talks with french president nicolas sarkozy and russian president dmitry medvedev on how security cooperation between the three nations can be improved .
the three leaders will also discuss their joint positions ahead of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in south korea on november 11-12 and france 's objectives for when it assumes the leadership of the g20 in november and the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- in january .
the meeting in the french town comes at a time when relations between russia and the eu seem to be improving with moscow showing signs that closer ties with the eu , especially with those former soviet states which are now members of the european bloc , have become a priority .
among the security issues up for discussion on the deauville agenda will be the stability of restive regions on europe 's eastern flank and potential flashpoints such as the breakaway moldovan region of transdniestria , and the stand-off between armenia and azerbaijan over nagorno-karabakh .
while these and other issues between the nations which make up russia and the eu 's collective neighborhood all have strategic and security concerns for those in attendance , a report released friday by the european council on foreign relations -lrb- ecfr -rrb- think tank claims that " the merkel-medvedev-sarkozy summit has the right agenda but the wrong participants . "
report suggests eu needs to look to russia , turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions are still high in the region of nagorno-karabakh in the report entitled " the illusion of order and the specter of a multipolar europe , " authors mark leonard , the ecfr 's director , and ivan krastev claim that a european security trialogue between the eu , russia and turkey would be more effective in tackling conflicts and promoting stability in the problem regions of eastern europe and central asia .
" the idea is that an informal forum with the key players could breathe life back into the formal european security institutions , " mark leonard told deutsche welle .
" one of the reasons that the current institutions are dead-locked is the fact that russia is questioning their legitimacy . " " meanwhile turkey is frustrated at the short-sighted way that some eu member states are holding up the accession process . it is so difficult to get things done through the formal institutions that europe 's powers are often acting outside them . this is not good for the eu as we want a continent run through multilateral institutions rather than spheres of influence or the balance of power .
the report argues that we should therefore engage with the other players to revitalise these institutions . " " the eu is missing an opportunity to think creatively about a new security architecture and come up with its own initiative on the future of the european order , " leonard added . europe urged to take responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgia war highlighted europe 's weaknesses with the united states , europe 's erstwhile protector , shifting its focus to its own concerns in afghanistan , iran and china , the ecfr report calls on the eu to take more responsibility for security in its own neighborhood .
it states that the current security system has failed to prevent wars in kosovo and georgia , gas and oil disputes between russia and ukraine and defuse tensions between moscow and former soviet states and must adapt to a new reality . " all three players are very much affected by the states on the eu 's eastern flank and have developed complex ' neighborhood policies ' to manage relations with the western balkans , eastern europe and central asia , " said mark leonard .
" this grey zone of instability is threatened with ethnic tensions , weak states and energy issues . " the report suggests that a three-way dialogue leading to a potential security action plan with russia and turkey would provide the eu with a new structure in which it could participate in reducing tensions on its borders by demilitarising the continent 's most volatile regions and solving frozen conflicts . it also claims that if the initial results were satisfactory , eu nations could then be more receptive to russian president medvedev 's proposal for a european security treaty , a plan which has been met with suspicion and skepticism by a number of member states , as well as the us , which believe any such treaty could undermine nato and provide russia with a veto of the alliance 's activities . the ecfr has rejected the claim that such a security apparatus involving russia would threaten the nato-russia council or other existing structures such as the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , saying that any new forum would work alongside existing structures . continue reading for more on a pan-european security concept 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 18.10.2010 berlin announces plans to promote integration and attract skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants would be required to take german classes following claims that multiculturalism has failed , germany has announced plans to promote the integration of immigrants into society .
ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

the french interior minister said that based on the information , " the threat is real . " french interior minister brice hortefeux said on sunday that saudi intelligence services had warned of a new terror threat by al qaeda directed against europe , and in particular france .
" several hours or days ago , there was a new message from the saudis that said al qaeda in the arabian peninsula was without doubt active or planning to be active in europe , notably france , " the minister told french media .
" this is not about overestimating the threat or underestimating it , " hortefeux said .
" i am indicating , based on all these elements , that the threat is real . "
the latest in a series of alerts al qaeda in the arabian peninsula is an arm of al qaeda thought to be based in yemen .
the group has stepped up its activity in recent years as the country is struggling to end a civil war .
in the capital , sanaa , security measures have been stepped up to protect western institutions and embassies .

" initial talks on this issue went well , " offer said , without going into details .
a complex legal tussle between germany and switzerland over tax evasion has been running since the spring , when a series of cds containing evidence of massive tax evasion by germans using swiss bank accounts were sold to the german taxman .

" speculations about billion-euro return flows to the german state have absolutely no basis , " offer said .
" there are no secret papers either . "

but the names of the customers will not be handed over .
the two sides are reportedly considering a flat rate tax of 35 percent , 10 percent more than would be payable as capital gains tax in germany .
an agreement has also been proposed for german savings that have been earning interest on investments in swiss bank accounts for years .
according to news magazine focus , the banks will calculate the amount by which the funds have grown in the past 10 years , and will transfer 35 percent of this directly to the german state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandal erupted when a cd containing bank account data was stolen volker wissing , chairman of the german parliament 's financial committee , told the magazine , " there are only winners , except for the tax cheats . "

" the initial discussions were constructive , " he said .
" both parties have agreed to keep the details confidential . "
it will be decided in the autumn whether these discussions will lead to formal negotiations , but offer says that the new protocol , which is almost ready to be signed , meets the standards of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in terms of transparency and the effective exchange of information .

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .

florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "

" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .

" from an early age on , we grow up with different cultures , so we 're used to it , " says nicolas .
they all speak german - that is their common language .
the tannenbusch tenements , far from downtown bonn , were built about 40 years ago , when the city urgently needed housing for the many foreign embassy employees .
but after unification , bonn lost its status as germany 's capital , and in 1999 , the government moved to the new capital , berlin .

brueser berg teenagers usually hang out in the pedestrian zone , says wladimir .
many are aggressive , he says , and more often than not they are muslims who dislike germans . his friend felix has made the same observation .
" many of them come from places dominated by violence , so they have poor social skills , " he says .
just the other day , felix says , there was an incident with a black boy who insulted him , followed him and only left off when felix 's friends came to his rescue .
the best approach is to avoid contact with aggressive children , felix says , since teachers are no help at all .
" they will rebuke a student , or keep him in after school , but that does n't change a thing .
if you tell on them and they are punished , the situation will get even worse . "

children and teenagers with immigrant backgrounds live and learn side-by-side with germans - the potential for conflict is huge . a group of teenagers is playing soccer on a field in tannenbusch , a northern suburb of the western german city of bonn .
nina is from kasakhstan , nicolas 's parents moved to germany from portugal , yann 's dad is french .
jan is the only german .
the group mirrors the situation in a suburb considered a social hot spot , where only one out of four citizens is german .
" from an early age on , we grow up with different cultures , so we 're used to it , " says nicolas .
they all speak german - that is their common language .
the tannenbusch tenements , far from downtown bonn , were built about 40 years ago , when the city urgently needed housing for the many foreign embassy employees .
but after unification , bonn lost its status as germany 's capital , and in 1999 , the government moved to the new capital , berlin .
the diplomatic missions followed suit , taking with them their employees , and leaving behind empty tenements .
today , ethnic germans from russia live in tannenbusch , along with asylum-seekers from syria , iraq and afghanistan who live in dismal high rises that jan calls the " barracks . "
unemployment , violence and crime come with the turf .
yann says the situation at the local high school is not as bad because there are fewer foreigners , but even there , he has encountered violence .

zacharia was three years old when his family moved to bonn from morocco , he says .
bored , he and his friend hilal do their best to annoy passersby .
the germans are okay , they say .
but they try to avoid and ignore a certain boy from afghanistan .

no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 18.10.2010 pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay 's four founders were convicted in 2009 in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .
the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "

and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 18.10.2010 election results delayed again as afghanistan contact group meets in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even a month after the election , results have not been disclosed diplomats from over 40 countries have met in rome with us commander david petraeus to discuss the situation in afghanistan .
the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael steiner , germany 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan ' hype ' about negotiations with the taliban the election and its outcome was one of the issues on the agenda of the afghanistan international contact group in rome on monday .
besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .

the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead .

" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .

unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .
" the government is in control , " industry minister christian estrosi told rtl radio .
" there will be no blockade for companies , no blockade for transport and no blockade for road users . " on monday , the government activated an emergency government crisis unit charged with maintaining fuel supplies .

the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

nevertheless , there is neither more , nor less at stake for the junta in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- than the legitimisation of their rule .
perhaps that is the reason for this last public step in an election which critics say is already threatening to turn into a farce .
democracy icon behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi : icon of myanmar 's democratic movement opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest - her party won the elections in 1990 but was never allowed to take power .
suu kyi herself has spent the larger part of the past 20 years in detention .
her current term of house arrest is scheduled to end on november 13 , or a week after the election .
the name of the game 29 million voters will be eligible to vote across 40,000 polling stations , over 3,000 candidates from over 30 parties are contesting the election .
but a quarter of the seats in parliament are reserved for the military , and the election rules are considered to be tilted in favour of the junta 's proxy parties , among them the union solidarity and development party led by prime minister thein sein .
thein sein retired from his military post earlier this year .
and the junta announced last month that voting was being scrapped in parts of the insurgency-plagued ethnic areas , in effect excluding millions from the poll .
the main reason given by election commission chairman thein soe for the exclusion of foreign monitors and media is that " our country has a lot of experience in elections " .
a second reason : diplomats and representatives from un organisations based inside the myanmar will be allowed to observe the voting .
but no photography or filming will be allowed inside the polling stations so that the voters can " cast their votes freely " . ac / afp / reuters editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "

besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

" initial talks on this issue went well , " offer said , without going into details .
a complex legal tussle between germany and switzerland over tax evasion has been running since the spring , when a series of cds containing evidence of massive tax evasion by germans using swiss bank accounts were sold to the german taxman .
no handouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss banks will protect the names of their customers offer said that the two governments are now planning to sign a double taxation agreement by the end of this month , which will set the protocol for dealing with the hidden money .
but offer denied media reports suggesting that a spectacular deal had been reached , whereby switzerland would hand the german state 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in order to protect its banking secrets .
" speculations about billion-euro return flows to the german state have absolutely no basis , " offer said .
" there are no secret papers either . "
new taxes instead , switzerland will in the future impose a new tax on german banking customers , and revenues will be passed on to berlin .
but the names of the customers will not be handed over .
the two sides are reportedly considering a flat rate tax of 35 percent , 10 percent more than would be payable as capital gains tax in germany .
an agreement has also been proposed for german savings that have been earning interest on investments in swiss bank accounts for years .
according to news magazine focus , the banks will calculate the amount by which the funds have grown in the past 10 years , and will transfer 35 percent of this directly to the german state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandal erupted when a cd containing bank account data was stolen volker wissing , chairman of the german parliament 's financial committee , told the magazine , " there are only winners , except for the tax cheats . "
constructive , but secret , discussions offer commented that the bilateral working group set up in march is aiming to set up a permanent solution to the problem of untaxed capital investments set up by germans in switzerland .
" the initial discussions were constructive , " he said .

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .
extensive travel disruptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel reserves are running low an ongoing strike by rail workers continued to disrupt rail travel .
the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .
" the government is in control , " industry minister christian estrosi told rtl radio .
" there will be no blockade for companies , no blockade for transport and no blockade for road users . " on monday , the government activated an emergency government crisis unit charged with maintaining fuel supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is confident his reforms will pass bill expected to pass protesters want to force sarkozy to abandon a proposed law that would raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and bring the full retirement age to 67 . his center-right government says the measure is the only way to get the bloated pension deficit under control .
the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead .

" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .

" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .

bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.10.2010 fast start has dortmund dreaming of first league title run in nine years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin kept the celebrations going against cologne after a weekend that saw a temporary end to this season 's slew of upsets , a resurgent borussia dortmund find themselves top of the table .
and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

" initial talks on this issue went well , " offer said , without going into details .
a complex legal tussle between germany and switzerland over tax evasion has been running since the spring , when a series of cds containing evidence of massive tax evasion by germans using swiss bank accounts were sold to the german taxman .
no handouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss banks will protect the names of their customers offer said that the two governments are now planning to sign a double taxation agreement by the end of this month , which will set the protocol for dealing with the hidden money .
but offer denied media reports suggesting that a spectacular deal had been reached , whereby switzerland would hand the german state 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in order to protect its banking secrets .
" speculations about billion-euro return flows to the german state have absolutely no basis , " offer said .
" there are no secret papers either . "
new taxes instead , switzerland will in the future impose a new tax on german banking customers , and revenues will be passed on to berlin .
but the names of the customers will not be handed over .
the two sides are reportedly considering a flat rate tax of 35 percent , 10 percent more than would be payable as capital gains tax in germany .
an agreement has also been proposed for german savings that have been earning interest on investments in swiss bank accounts for years .
according to news magazine focus , the banks will calculate the amount by which the funds have grown in the past 10 years , and will transfer 35 percent of this directly to the german state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandal erupted when a cd containing bank account data was stolen volker wissing , chairman of the german parliament 's financial committee , told the magazine , " there are only winners , except for the tax cheats . "
constructive , but secret , discussions offer commented that the bilateral working group set up in march is aiming to set up a permanent solution to the problem of untaxed capital investments set up by germans in switzerland .
" the initial discussions were constructive , " he said .
" both parties have agreed to keep the details confidential . "
it will be decided in the autumn whether these discussions will lead to formal negotiations , but offer says that the new protocol , which is almost ready to be signed , meets the standards of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in terms of transparency and the effective exchange of information .

" this is not about overestimating the threat or underestimating it , " hortefeux said .
" i am indicating , based on all these elements , that the threat is real . "
the latest in a series of alerts al qaeda in the arabian peninsula is an arm of al qaeda thought to be based in yemen .
the group has stepped up its activity in recent years as the country is struggling to end a civil war .

that was based on a tip-off that a female suicide bomber was planning to attack the transport system .
also in september , the eiffel tower had been evacuated twice over terror alerts .

i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .

if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .

perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a complex legal tussle between germany and switzerland over tax evasion has been running since the spring , when a series of cds containing evidence of massive tax evasion by germans using swiss bank accounts were sold to the german taxman .
no handouts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss banks will protect the names of their customers offer said that the two governments are now planning to sign a double taxation agreement by the end of this month , which will set the protocol for dealing with the hidden money .
but offer denied media reports suggesting that a spectacular deal had been reached , whereby switzerland would hand the german state 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in order to protect its banking secrets .
" speculations about billion-euro return flows to the german state have absolutely no basis , " offer said .
" there are no secret papers either . "
new taxes instead , switzerland will in the future impose a new tax on german banking customers , and revenues will be passed on to berlin .
but the names of the customers will not be handed over .
the two sides are reportedly considering a flat rate tax of 35 percent , 10 percent more than would be payable as capital gains tax in germany .
an agreement has also been proposed for german savings that have been earning interest on investments in swiss bank accounts for years .
according to news magazine focus , the banks will calculate the amount by which the funds have grown in the past 10 years , and will transfer 35 percent of this directly to the german state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scandal erupted when a cd containing bank account data was stolen volker wissing , chairman of the german parliament 's financial committee , told the magazine , " there are only winners , except for the tax cheats . "
constructive , but secret , discussions offer commented that the bilateral working group set up in march is aiming to set up a permanent solution to the problem of untaxed capital investments set up by germans in switzerland .
" the initial discussions were constructive , " he said .
" both parties have agreed to keep the details confidential . "
it will be decided in the autumn whether these discussions will lead to formal negotiations , but offer says that the new protocol , which is almost ready to be signed , meets the standards of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in terms of transparency and the effective exchange of information .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

the country is deeply divided between its flemish and french-speaking populations . the political crisis in belgium looks set to deepen as the country 's french speaking political parties have rejected a coalition proposal from the flemish separatist n-va party , which had emerged as the strongest party in parliamentary elections in june .

" in japan we have a unique opportunity to get everyone - governments , businesses and the public - on board to address the crisis facing life on earth , " said julia marton-lefevre , director general of international union for conservation of nature . the diversity of life on earth was being lost at the fastest rate ever seen , japanese farm minister michihiko kano said ahead of the major international meeting on biodiversity in nagoya , japan , which runs until october 29 . " the loss of biodiversity is developing in the fastest pace ever , " he said .

the talks will also attempt to set a new target for preserving plant and animal species threatened by human activity . some 21 percent of all known mammals , 30 percent of known amphibians and 12 percent of known birds are under threat , according to the international union for conservation of nature . habitat loss , hunting and climate change are among the central reasons for the decline in biodiversity . the un named 2010 the international year of biodiversity and one of the un 's millennium development goals calls for " significantly " halting wildlife loss by 2010 . yet it was a goal that no country managed to achieve in the past decade , despite increasing awareness of the extent of the problem . new biodiversity targets the meeting in japan is scheduled to set a new 20-point plan of diversity goals for the next decade . the targets under discussion include cutting pollution , halving the loss and degradation of forests and other natural habitats , making the public aware of nature 's resources and ensuring that agriculture and aquaculture are sustainably managed . the 2020 goals are an improvement over the previous set of goals because they address the root causes of biodiversity loss as well as biodiversity 's sustainable use , according to charles perrings of arizona state university , who led an international team of scientists to develop a strategic approach to the 2020 targets . " often there are no real instruments for protection , and those that do exist have no teeth , " perrings said of the rules to protect biodiversity .
" there are lots of reasons , reasonable ones , for people making private decisions that lead to biodiversity loss , but they cost us all collectively .

france and germany were expected to emphasize that a missile defense plan does not threaten moscow . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy met russian president dmitry medvedev in an effort to seek greater east-west co-operation on defense policy . the summit began over dinner on monday evening in the french resort town of deauville , with details of the discussions to be announced on tuesday . merkel and sarkozy had met earlier in the day to agree their own position before medvedev joined them for talks that were expected to focus on european security issues and russia 's relationship with nato . nato is expected to unveil a new security vision - which would involve a european missile defense shield - at a planned meeting of the alliance in november .
medvedev has not yet said if he will attend that event , but merkel and sarkozy hope the talks in deauville will win russian support for the project . " we will discuss whether it is possible for russia and nato to cooperate better , because the era of the cold war is definitely over , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast on saturday . closer ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders will try to show they can cooperate recently , medvedev has come out in support of a new joint european security framework , but russia has been reluctant to support a missile shield , which it fears could target russian cities . another agenda item for the meeting , which an aide for sarkozy described as a " brainstorming session , " is france 's upcoming role as the chair of the g-20 in 2011 when it takes over the reigns from south korea . despite the informal nature of the talks , some of germany and france 's allies are a little miffed at being excluded from the conversation . russia is seen as turning its view more and more to the west , but continues to be at odds with some global powers like the united states on some issues . germany and france , however , enjoy relatively good relations with russia , and the three leaders met in june on the sidelines of the g-20 summit in toronto . author : matt zuvela -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some agree , saying immigrants are n't integrating .
others say the state ca n't fail what it never tried . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in my opinion germany has never been trying to be multicultural .
my family immigrated to germany 15 years ago , my parents speak german fluently but their diplomas were never accepted - and this did n't happen only to my family but to many other people as well .
germany is fooling itself . - jana , russia germany should abandon integration because a lot of germans are hostile towards foreigners .
in countries like australia people get automatically integrated as the people here are very friendly and tolerant .
i 've been living in australia for two years and have always felt at home , something that never happens in europe . - fari , australia i married a german , i stayed in germany and my son went to a german school .
i work for a german firm , i love living in germany .
i live by the german law and respect the german culture .
simple . - malcolm , germany i totally agree with chancellor merkel that immigrants in germany must learn the language of the country , before being considered for employment .
they must also obey the laws of their adopted country .
in selection of immigrants , only highly skilled people should be considered , but german nationals , regardless of age , should always be given priority in the job market . - heinz , canada it seems to me that it would be more productive to encourage the indigenous german population to reproduce .
tax breaks , encouragement , supportive working conditions could be used toward this end .
if pay is structured so that women must work for families to pay the bills , then what can you expect but smaller families ?
otherwise , if immigration is the solution , then germany will someday no longer be populated by germans . - sam , us chancellor merkel , thank you for being honest and not afraid to say the politically incorrect thing .
multiculturalism is nonsense .
germany needs to retain its own identity and immigrants have to demonstrate they like the country that they choose to immigrate to .
i have complained about multiculturalism in canada for many years and now i see the chancellor 's comments have also awakened other critics in canada .
perhaps she and her colleague have finally called the hypocrites ' bluff . - gerhard , canada multiculturalism without attempting to assimilate into a society causes the failure .
the person immigrating to germany does so voluntarily .
when they do so they should expect to leave behind their former cultural ways , language , and laws and be prepared to accept the culture , language , and laws of their new country of residence .
i have visited germany on multiple locations and have seen the " society within a society " that has built up in cities such as hamburg , berlin , frankfurt and munich , among other locations .
in each of these cities , i have noted very little in the way of trying to " become german . " it is sad , but true .
chancellor merkel 's comments are far truer than what anyone wished . - michael , us i am a cuban-born american citizen who has only gone to europe twice .
on both occasions i visited germany for a few days .
i have to say that i never felt welcome in germany during those visits .
i found germans to be rather uncomfortable when it comes to dealing with people who do not look northern european ; especially in small towns away from big cities .
those turkish immigrants would have to be very desperate to have decided to leave their own countries to settle down to be second class citizens in a society as cold and xenophobic as german society is . - luis , cuba merkel 's statement that multiculturalism hat utterly failed in germany is only partly true .
as germany is ushered into multiculturalism , with the start of bringing in foreign or guest workers , it is now a full-fledged multi-ethnic state just like many other countries .
it is a good thing to asses the failures and achievements of successive german governments ' policies , especially within the bounds of integration .
it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .
the point here is to build up incentive and opportunity , plus sincere government willingness to create workable integration schemes with broadmindedness , minus populist tendencies with short term goals for one party 's advantage . - sai , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' in a speech to supporters , chancellor angela merkel said multiculturalism in germany has not been successful .
party leaders also sparred over immigrants ' role in filling the country 's shortage of skilled workers .

and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .
homegrown talent sahin , who in 2005 became the youngest-ever bundesliga player when he made his professional debut at just under the age of 17 , has developed into a true rudder .
the holding midfielder has arguably been the league 's most valuable player in the first weeks of the season .
tireless creative midfielder-winger shinji kagawa , acquired from japan this summer for a mere 350,000 euros , has proved a massive bargain .
the same can be said for striker lukas barrios , who joined the club in 2009 for 4.2 million euros .
the paraguayan gives dortmund an effective target man , who 's also great in the air , scoring 23 goals in 41 games .
the squad has taken to the one-touch , attacking style favored by coach klopp and are capable of advancing the ball up the pitch more quickly than the vast majority of bundesliga sides .
they also have the skill and size to exploit set pieces .
opponents have found them very difficult to stop .
a tally of 20 goals in eight games is just one reason why they 're currently the odds-on favorites for the bundesliga title .
no need for brilliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund have already beaten bayern this year all the positives notwithstanding , dortmund are still something of a diamond in the rough .
the squad could definitely become more clinical with both their passing and finishing , and it remains to be seen how the youngsters will respond to inevitable setbacks .
but dortmund do n't necessarily have to be stellar , just very good , to launch a serious title bid .
bayern munich 's faltering start has opened up a rare opportunity that klopp 's men are best poised to seize .
after eight rounds , the reigning champs already have a 10-point deficit to make up .
with dortmund capable of going something like 18-4-4 for the rest of the season , bayern 's margin for error is slim .
the 75,000-plus fans who pack dortmund 's stadium for home games would probably be pretty happy if the team just returned to the champions league after years in the doldrums .
but klopp and a lot of others who follow german football know that this season dortmund should also be aiming higher . author : jefferson chase editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael steiner , germany 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan ' hype ' about negotiations with the taliban the election and its outcome was one of the issues on the agenda of the afghanistan international contact group in rome on monday .
besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

with this nomination he follows in the footsteps of president hu jintao , whom he is likely to succeed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china ranks second in the world in arms spending the central military commission is one of the most powerful institutions within the chinese political system .
it is also the stepping stone to the country ’ s presidency .
the commission controls the people ’ s liberation army with an estimated troop level of over two million .
the armed forces have an annual budget of approximately 80 billion us dollars - the second highest in the world .
rise of xi jinping many analysts regard this as another indication that xi jinping will take over hu ’ s party post as chairman next year .
hu will have to step down from running the communist party in late 2012 and from the presidency in early 2013 .
xi became the party chief of a village at the age of 21 .
he governed the eastern province of zhejiang for five years and was responsible for the preparations of the 2008 beijing olympics .
since october 2007 , he has been one of the nine members of the standing committee of the party ’ s politburo .
the 57-year-old is the son of former top party member xi zhongxun .
reformist or technocrat ?
xi ’ s father helped to develop china ’ s special economic zones in the mid 1980s and opposed the student protest crackdown on tiananmen square .
based on his father ’ s liberalism , some analysts have speculated that , once he takes power , xi could gradually introduce legal and democratic reforms .
but xi jinping seems more of a technocrat than a reformist .
some observers argue that xi is a bureaucrat who won his promotion by anticipating the wishes of the party ’ s elder generation of leaders .
he is also seen as close to former president jiang zemin .

china has tried to foster domestic demand recently in order to become more independent from its exports .
the chinese leadership also stated that the next five years would be " a time of difficult issues for deepening the reform and opening process " .
they also stressed that the communist party would be the " fundamental guarantee " for the nation ’ s future. cvg / afp / dpa / reuters editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de justice -pipe- 18.10.2010 pirate bay appeals trial could go to swedish supreme court , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pirate bay 's four founders were convicted in 2009 in a dw interview , swedish law professor marten schultz says that the defense strategy has been consistent .
the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter sunde is one of the four defendants in the pirate bay case now , what was the defense 's argument as to why this decision should be overturned ?
the thrust of their argument is something like the google argument .
that the pirate bay is just a web page and they should n't be held responsible for what other people are doing .
they just give the technique , they do n't actually do the crime itself .
the original case was the landmark case for copyright and online piracy .
is the appeals phase getting as much attention as the first trial in sweden ?
i think the second phase of the trial has not been given that much attention of the trial as the first part .
but i do think - and this may not be from a layman 's perspective , but rather from a legal perspective - this seems to be a clear candidate for a supreme court decision .
if it makes it to the supreme court then it will get more attention in the legal community .
the normal newspapers would probably not pay attention to it , but the lawyers would pay attention to it .
and as far as i see it , it seems to be a good candidate for the supreme court .
why is that ?
because this is a very interesting legal question : how far can you be responsible for what other people are doing on a platform that you created on the internet ?
so , how can you extend responsibility for what anonymous people are doing on your webpage , or on an internet site like the pirate bay to this extent ?
that is the interesting question as far as i see it .

the defendants have argued that they are not infringing copyright any more than google does when it links . about a year and a half ago , four swedes were convicted of assisting copyright infringement through their website the pirate bay , one of the world 's largest clearinghouses of peer-to-peer filesharing bittorrent files .
but the pirate bay just provides links to bittorrent files , it does n't actually host or commit copyright infringement itself .
still , the site 's four founders were found guilty and were ordered to each serve a year in prison and collectively pay 2.7 million euros -lrb- or $ 3.6 million -rrb- .
however , that decision is currently under appeal in a swedish court in stockholm .
the appeals trial just ended last friday , and now the four are awaiting the court 's decision in the next few weeks .
to learn more about this case , deutsche welle spoke with marten schultz , a professor of law at uppsala university .
he 's been following the appeals case and attended some of the sessions .
deutsche welle : what was the atmosphere like at the appeals trial ?
marten schultz : the appeals trial , in this case , and what is normally the case , is a little bit of a stale version of the first instance of the proceedings .
it was similar to the first instance but with fewer people .
another thing was that this trial was held in an official security room in the appeals court , which means that few people were able to attend the court , which also contributed to the more relaxed atmosphere .
but it was similar to the first instance of the court proceedings .
a lot of people were there , a lot of journalists were there at the beginning of the trial .
there was a weird dynamic which has been in this trial , where the accused are covering the trial as it unfolds on the internet , they 're posting live on twitter and on blogs and stuff on the proceedings , day-by-day , which is a very unusual thing .
so the defendants are actually live-blogging and live tweeting while they themselves are on trial ?
yeah , they are .
and the days i was there they even commented on stuff that i wrote , because i covered it on twitter and on my blog as well .
so they were live-commenting as the trial went along .
now i know that in the initial trial , the defendants did n't seem to take the trial very seriously .
does the fact they were live-tweeting during the trial show that they were n't taking this trial seriously either ?
i 'm not too sure .
i was there for a couple of the days and they seemed to be taking it seriously .
you could say that they were still defiant in their comments on twitter .
they seemed to be taking it seriously .
it was n't that they saw the trial as a joke anymore , which was the impression you could get during the first trial .

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 18.10.2010 berlin announces plans to promote integration and attract skilled workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants would be required to take german classes following claims that multiculturalism has failed , germany has announced plans to promote the integration of immigrants into society .
ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .
extensive travel disruptions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel reserves are running low an ongoing strike by rail workers continued to disrupt rail travel .
the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .
" the government is in control , " industry minister christian estrosi told rtl radio .
" there will be no blockade for companies , no blockade for transport and no blockade for road users . " on monday , the government activated an emergency government crisis unit charged with maintaining fuel supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is confident his reforms will pass bill expected to pass protesters want to force sarkozy to abandon a proposed law that would raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , and bring the full retirement age to 67 . his center-right government says the measure is the only way to get the bloated pension deficit under control .
the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 18.10.2010 politicians join hochtief takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers want berlin to defend the company germany 's political leadership is considering changing securities laws to help defend the nation 's biggest builder , hochtief , against a hostile takeover bid from spanish construction giant acs . spanish construction company actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- has until november 19 to present german regulators with its takeover bid for the essen-based building group hochtief .
acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy us election -pipe- 18.10.2010 less hype , new law present obstacles for american voters overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the midterm elections gauge the first years of the obama presidency unlike the presidential election two years ago , democrats and republicans abroad find it more difficult to get americans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections .
and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

" in japan we have a unique opportunity to get everyone - governments , businesses and the public - on board to address the crisis facing life on earth , " said julia marton-lefevre , director general of international union for conservation of nature . the diversity of life on earth was being lost at the fastest rate ever seen , japanese farm minister michihiko kano said ahead of the major international meeting on biodiversity in nagoya , japan , which runs until october 29 . " the loss of biodiversity is developing in the fastest pace ever , " he said .
" it is our responsibility to carry over a rich biodiversity to the next generation . " red alert for species loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 30 percent of amphibians are in danger of extinction delegates to the 193-nation convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- will discuss how to pay for the " equitable sharing " of the benefits from natural resources .
the talks will also attempt to set a new target for preserving plant and animal species threatened by human activity . some 21 percent of all known mammals , 30 percent of known amphibians and 12 percent of known birds are under threat , according to the international union for conservation of nature . habitat loss , hunting and climate change are among the central reasons for the decline in biodiversity . the un named 2010 the international year of biodiversity and one of the un 's millennium development goals calls for " significantly " halting wildlife loss by 2010 . yet it was a goal that no country managed to achieve in the past decade , despite increasing awareness of the extent of the problem . new biodiversity targets the meeting in japan is scheduled to set a new 20-point plan of diversity goals for the next decade . the targets under discussion include cutting pollution , halving the loss and degradation of forests and other natural habitats , making the public aware of nature 's resources and ensuring that agriculture and aquaculture are sustainably managed . the 2020 goals are an improvement over the previous set of goals because they address the root causes of biodiversity loss as well as biodiversity 's sustainable use , according to charles perrings of arizona state university , who led an international team of scientists to develop a strategic approach to the 2020 targets . " often there are no real instruments for protection , and those that do exist have no teeth , " perrings said of the rules to protect biodiversity .
" there are lots of reasons , reasonable ones , for people making private decisions that lead to biodiversity loss , but they cost us all collectively .

and a new law makes the voting process even tougher . the 2008 presidential election was a self-starter : with the cast including an african-american candidate with pop star qualities and a serious shot of winning , a vietnam war hero turned maverick politician and the unknown governor of alaska , mobilizing american voters overseas was n't too hard .
add to that the fact that barack obama travelled to berlin during the campaign to give a speech before tens of thousands of enthusiastic supporters and that many americans abroad were glad after eight years to simply have george w. bush not appear on the ballot anymore .
things are very different in 2010 .
to be sure , the midterm elections with their more regional focus and the absence of nationally or internationally recognizable candidates are always a tougher sell to americans living abroad who may lack the local knowledge and not feel the immediacy of many presidential races .
still , many people who voted in the presidential election last time , feel a sense of disillusionment , says michael steltzer , vice chair of democrats abroad germany , part of the international branch of the democratic party .
" it 's difficult because we knew that when obama got elected that he would have a hard job to do to change things around and some things are not changing as fast as many people had hoped , " he told deutsche welle .
" the enthusiasm is not there that was there two years ago .
there certainly is a difference , even though this election is just as important as the last one was . "
florida serves as a reminder and indeed with the democratic majority in congress at stake and many close races that could have a great impact on the overall outcome of the election , there is a clear incentive for american voters abroad to cast their ballots . while there are no official figures , it is estimated that some seven or eight million americans are living overseas - roughly as many as the population of the state of virginia .
how many of those actually cast their vote is hard to gauge , since there are no overall statistics of international voters .
but the presidential election 2000 , in which a few hundred ballots in florida from overseas voters decided the race , serves as the historic example to party officials that every vote from abroad counts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the democratic party to make voting outside of the us easier , washington last year passed a new law , the so called move act .
the 2010 midterm elections are the first time the new law is in effect .
" it makes it possible for us to use electronic transmissions , " explained steltzer .
" all of the states are required to accept electronic transmission possibilities which we did not really have before . "
the states are also given a deadline by which they have to send out ballots .
currently , the obama administration is suing some states who have failed to comply with the deadline , among them new york .
no more automatic ballots but the new law also has a negative side .
earlier , if overseas voters were registered , they would automatically get their ballots mailed to them from their state .
now voters have to apply in time for a ballot for every election .
that means that eligible voters need to find out the deadline for each election ahead of time and have to go through the registration process each time . " so we have to make sure that all the americans that we can find and know about are aware of that , " says steltzer .
" that 's a big step . "
that step - convincing overseas americans to cast their vote - may be easier this time around for republicans than for democrats .
" this election is to a large extent a referendum on the performance of the obama administration , " michael ricks , chair of republicans abroad germany , told deutsche welle .
" many are hugely disappointed in his delivery on his promises and as a result will be going to the polls looking to make a change . "
boilerplate rhetoric while ricks and steltzer , who reside in munich and berlin , respectively , literally live an ocean apart from washington , their election pitches sound like they are coming straight from inside the beltway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chapter of the international arm of the republican party " i think at a time when we have economic challenges , when there are people who are either out of a job or worried about losing their home now is a time to be tightening belts and not a time to let a tax-and-spend liberal run the country , " says ricks .
" obama has more or less inherited an unbelievable recession , " argues steltzer .
" eight years of the bush administration are not easy to turn around all of a sudden .
you have got these wars going on and the steps that obama is taking are long-term steps , so many people who are impatient with change should just consider the alternative . "
one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

after an award-winning year and performances at the salzburger festspiele , the singer talks with dw about what inspires her singing . deutsche welle : your career has led you to many important stages in the world but not to germany .
why is that ? joyce didonato : well , when i started auditioning , my first jobs were in paris , london , milan and amsterdam .
after i would sing there , they invited me back immediately , and my schedule quickly filled up with repeat performances .
now , i have a really strong relationship with the public , especially in paris and london . i did do a very quick and inconsequential debut in munich years ago , but i doubt anyone remembers it .
but i plan to come back many times now .
i 'll be making my debut in berlin this year , so i 'm finally catching up with the rest of the world when it comes to germany . germany 's echo award jury named you classical singer of the year in 2010 for your operatic work .
your focus has been on italian operas - how did that come about ? i have the great fortune of having a voice that has some flexibility to it .
rossini was a very obvious and good match for me .
he also led me to handel and then to the bigger bel canto repertoire . what i 've learned as a musician and artist by singing these composers is tremendous .
there 's nothing worse than this kind of music just being sung as a vocalese with all of the notes in place but not really coming alive .
so i 've had to work very hard to find the ways of making this music important .
my latest cd explored the dramatic side of rossini , and i found a treasure trove of richness and complexity in his writing and characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rossini should give listeners a certain bubbly sensation , said didonato is italian opera more demanding for you than singing parts from other operatic traditions ? it 's all demanding . -lsb- laughs -rsb- i did n't pick an easy profession . rossini needs to sound like champagne and sound easy - like fireworks just coming out of your mouth - but it takes a lot of work to make that happen .
on the other hand , i 'm singing octavian -lsb- in richard strauss ' " der rosenkavalier " -rsb- this year in madrid , and it 's a tremendous amount of work for me in terms of the language and finding all of those little turns in the character .
so , i find it all challenging but , as a result , rewarding . are these aspects of rossini 's work that you described also part of your personality ? i think they are in some ways .
i have some complexity to me that is not only supported by rossini - there 's some mahler in there too . the only possibility to succeed is to be present in the moment .
if i 'm thinking about the final aria when i start the opera , there 's no way i 'll have a good performance .
really , the only way to create a real character is to be fully in the moment , and that 's something i 've tried to bring into my life . this year at the salzburg festival you performed with one of classical music 's icons , edita gruberova .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 18.10.2010 german politicians argue over health checks on test-tube embryos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first step to a child - and the source of a moral problem for some should a mother be allowed to have the health of a test-tube embryo checked before it is implanted in her womb ?
some german politicians want to reverse a court decision allowing her to do so when a woman decides to have a so-called " test-tube baby , " she has the possibility of letting the doctor check if the embryo which will be implanted in her womb is likely to suffer from any serious diseases .
if the chances are high , she can decide not to have it implanted and to try again .
such pre-implantation diagnosis -lrb- pid -rrb- used to be illegal in germany , but a decision by the federal court of justice in june decided that such a test was legal if it was intended only to exclude a serious handicap .
many christians have never been happy with that ruling : they argue that an embryo enjoys complete human rights from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - the main party in the governing coalition - follows that policy , although so far it 's done nothing about it .
chancellor opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not usually quick to take a firm stand , but she has done so this time the chancellor and leader of the party , angela merkel , has now made her views clear : " after weighing up all the arguments , " she told young members of her party on saturday , " and it 's not an easy decision - it is almost impossible - in fact , it is impossible , to find a difference between a serious genetic disease and a perhaps not so serious genetic disease .
and so i think that we should go for a ban . "
the fear is that couples could use pid to assure themselves " designer babies , " with the right sex , or even the right color hair .
but the general secretary of the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , christan lindner , said the fdp would not support a ban .
" if one can take away the worry from a couple , " he said , " if you can fulfill their desire for a child and prevent serious genetic diseases before the embryo is implanted in the womb , then that is an ethical advance . "
caution proposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pregnancy should be made as carefree as possible , says lindner but not everyone in his party agrees .
ursula flach , deputy head of the parliamentary party , insists that they see the need for restrictions on the use of pid .
" that way , we want to ensure that only those families are allowed to use pid where there are serious genetic illnesses in the family , " she said .
even in the cdu there are those who disagree with the party leader . peter hintze , head of the party in the state of north rhine-westphalia and a former protestant priest , points out that a woman can have an abortion if a test of the fetus shows a serious health condition .
" it 's quite a contradiction if we do n't allow the cells to be checked , " he argues , " but we do allow the fetus to be checked in the womb .
we should get rid of this contradiction . "
there 's disagreement within the parties of the opposition too . as a result it 's been decided that there 'll be a free vote when the issue comes up in the bundestag . a spokesman for chancellor merkel said she had the greatest respect for those with a different opinion , and that it was a matter of conscience .

one thing that steltzer and ricks can agree on is that while it is quite late , americans abroad who have n't done so should find out on the internet whether they can still register and vote in their state .
as for the outcome of the midterm election , democrats in the us and abroad are clearly hoping to avert a republican landslide and hold on to both chambers of congress .
however , according to the latest polls , michael ricks ' election prognosis seems more realistic . " it 's always difficult to make predictions in politics , but i would expect that mr. obama is going to be experiencing a very cold winter in washington .

france and germany were expected to emphasize that a missile defense plan does not threaten moscow . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy met russian president dmitry medvedev in an effort to seek greater east-west co-operation on defense policy . the summit began over dinner on monday evening in the french resort town of deauville , with details of the discussions to be announced on tuesday . merkel and sarkozy had met earlier in the day to agree their own position before medvedev joined them for talks that were expected to focus on european security issues and russia 's relationship with nato . nato is expected to unveil a new security vision - which would involve a european missile defense shield - at a planned meeting of the alliance in november .
medvedev has not yet said if he will attend that event , but merkel and sarkozy hope the talks in deauville will win russian support for the project .

and the bookmakers are betting they stay there . there are matches won on inspiration and those won on perspiration .
dortmund 's most recent victory , a 2-1 away win in cologne , was a bit of both .
for the first half , the men in yellow and black completely dominated , taking a deserved lead and leaving cologne hanging on by the hairs hanging from club mascot hennes the billy goat 's chin .
but dortmund also had to withstand a desperately aggressive comeback from their relegation-threatened hosts , only sealing the match in the dying minutes on a goal by midfield general nuri sahin .
the shot , which saw the turkish national slamming the ball into his own leg before it found the net , was probably sahin 's clumsiest moment on the night .
but it was also indicative of the determination and will that have sent dortmund on a seven-game winning streak .
" it was remarkable how the team reacted to the equalizer , " dortmund 's ever-enthusiastic coach juergen klopp effused after the match .
" that 's what you call mentality .
we never lost faith , and that 's why the victory is deserved . "
there have been few reasons to believe in dortmund for the past decade .
but this season , logic as well as the conviction of the league 's most passionate supporters says the westphalians have an excellent shot at some silverware .
dortmund , inc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp is a players ' coach with a good sense of tactics as mercurial as their rise might seem to outsiders , the 2010-11 dortmund squad is the result of long-term planning and signals the club 's recovery from a period of financial recklessness that almost saw it go broke .
dortmund 's greatest period of glory was 1994-97 , when the club won two bundesliga and one champions league title .
but in an attempt to maintain that standard , team bosses got caught up in the over-reliance on foreign talent and bidding wars that characterized football around the turn of the millennium .
in 1999 , the club incorporated and became a listed company on the german stock market .
that raised short-term cash , which helped the team to a further bundesliga title in 2002 , but was ultimately part of a financial downward spiral that left the club some 100 million euros -lrb- $ 140 million -rrb- in the red and on the verge of insolvency .
since 2004 , the club has been on a consolidation and rebuilding course that is now paying dividends .
after nine years of mediocrity , dortmund have reduced their debts and built up a well-balanced , young squad , led by one of germany 's better coaches .
excellent chemistry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios is one of the bundesliga 's best strikers title-winning teams usually feature very different types of players , and dortmund seem to have gotten the mix right this year .

wulff is set to give a speech before the turkish parliament , the first ever by a german leader , in which he will most likely address the topic of integration of muslim immigrants in german society .
wulff 's recognition of islam as " part of germany , " which he expressed during a speech to the nation during reunification celebrations earlier this month , has set off a row in germany , sparking several high-ranking politicians to address the topic publicly .
' utterly failed ' on saturday , chancellor angela merkel joined that list by proclaiming that " multiculturalism has utterly failed " in germany .
" those who want to take part -lsb- in our society -rsb- must not only obey our laws , they must also master our language , " she said , agreeing , however , with wulff that islam was " part of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has echoed wulff 's comment that islam is ' part of germany ' merkel 's comments came a week after a visit to berlin by turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
there , the two leaders said they would work to improve the integration of the some 2.5 million members of the turkish community in germany .
according to the results of an interior ministry study released earlier this year , turks are the minority group in germany with the most pronounced integration problems .
the study said around one in five turks living in germany spoke either " bad " or " no german at all " and that language difficulties were the main obstacle to the successful integration of turkish immigrants .
more skilled-workers needed in her speech on saturday , however , merkel also underscored the continued importance of immigration to germany and the job market , especially highly skilled migrants .
she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

she pointed out that 200,000 germans retired and left the job market every year , and were n't replaced , which could lead to companies leaving germany due to labor shortages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan : germany must recognize foreign degrees key members of merkel 's cabinet echoed those sentiments on sunday .
at a christian democratic youth rally , education minister annette schavan called for improved recognition of degrees earned abroad , saying over 300,000 immigrants currently living in germany are fit for more skilled labor than that required for their current occupations .
economics minister rainer bruederle called for more " controlled immigration , " referring to the " indispensable role " of immigrants for the german economy .
labor minister ursula von der leyen said politicians needed to lower the barriers for skilled foreign workers to europe 's largest economy .
" for several years , more people have been leaving our country than entering it , " she told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" wherever possible , we must lower the entry hurdles for those who bring the country forward . "
' fostering radicalism ' the ministers were responding to calls made last weekend by bavaria 's state premier for a " stop to muslim and arab immigration . "
after making the statements , horst seehofer explained that the lack of skilled workers did not necessitate a policy of open-ended immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer was accused of using populist strategies seehofer has met with widespread criticism among rights groups and politicians who accuse him of fostering radicalism .
malu dreyer , who chairs an integration panel representing germany 's 16 federal states , said seehofer was attempting to use the " illogical cliches and fears among the german people to impede the atmosphere of integration . "
dreyer added that seehofer had simply adopted the general racist fear that " immigrants are unwilling to integrate and only there to cash in on the benefits of the states . "

acs currently owns just less than 30 percent of hochtief .
it plans to increase its stake to just over 50 percent in an all-share offer that hochtief says does not represent fair value for the group .
the hostile bid has sparked strong opposition from hochtief 's employees , with both the company 's management and workers calling on germany 's political leaders to intervene .
german chancellor angela merkel threw her hat into the ring for the first time on friday , warning against splitting up the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is germany 's biggest construction company now the financial times deutschland reports the federal government is reportedly considering changing securities legislation to hinder the deal .
" we are analyzing the existing regulations and examining the possible introduction of further requirements , ” an unnamed government source told the newspaper .
this is not the first time germany 's political leaders have attempted to influence commercial developments in the nation 's industrial sector .
recent years have seen german governments shield companies from unwelcome takeovers or shore up troubled groups on a number of occasions .
in 1999 , former chancellor gerhard schroeder launched a rescue operation for the troubled construction group philipp holzmann .
about two years ago , merkel 's government drew up plans to throw a financial lifeline to general motors ' ailing european offshoot opel .
political pressure speaking at a press briefing on friday , merkel 's spokesman , steffen seibert , raised the political stakes in the takeover battle by describing hochtief as a showcase of german technological expertise .
" for that reason , the government and the chancellor 's office believe that hochtief 's industrial structures and headquarters should remain in essen , " seibert told reporters .
" the government is monitoring this issue very closely and is in contact with the company , " said seibert .
" it assumes that any activities that might take place will be in line with european law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle says berlin should not get involved in the takeover battle initially , berlin appeared reluctant to respond to hochtief 's appeals for help in its battle to repel acs 's unwelcome advances .
economics minister rainer bruederle has repeatedly ruled out any moves to intervene in the hochtief takeover .
bruederle is a member of the pro-business free democrats , which are the junior member of the ruling coalition led by merkel 's christian democrats .
“ german efforts to break down international trade barriers keep our export sector running .
we must keep our own economy open in return , ” bruederle told the handelsblatt newspaper on monday .
white knight the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have seized on the controversy surrounding hochtief to attack merkel 's response to the takeover .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , spd chief sigmar gabriel called on merkel to find a corporate “ white knight ” to rescue hochtief .
" the quickest way the chancellor can help is if she finds a consortium which is ready to take out a minimum 25-percent stake , " gabriel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chief sigmar gabriel visited essen to show his support " the political leadership gave considerable help to the german banks during the financial crisis , " he said .
" i think that the banks now have the responsibility to do something for germany as an industry location . "
gabriel used a visit to hochtief 's headquarters on thursday to criticize business rules in germany , which he said failed to protect a good company like hochtief from a takeover by a heavily indebted firm like acs .
" what is happening here is economic nonsense , " he said , adding that the regulatory framework should be changed .
german securities laws require bidding companies to make a mandatory takeover offer once their stake in a target company exceeds 30 percent .
gabriel said germany should consider introducing additional mandatory-offer thresholds closer to 50 percent – a move that would make takeover bids less predictable and more expensive .
australian defense as german politicians debate the best course of action , hochtief itself is preparing another layer of defense against acs in australia .
hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton delivers around 80 per cent of the concern 's total earnings and is widely considered the jewel in the crown that acs is after .
the german company has therefore asked australian regulators to oblige acs to make a bid for outstanding minority shares in leighton if it gains control of hochtief .
the australian securities and investment commission -lrb- asic -rrb- has yet to make a ruling on the request .
if granted , it could increase the cost of the spanish takeover bid by up to 7 billion euros .

it is also equally important to look at the part of foreigners and why there are shortcomings to be fully integrated into the society .
it is wrong to indulge in the blame game , so that merkel 's party picks up some more votes in the coming election or looks better in poll statistics .

nevertheless , there is neither more , nor less at stake for the junta in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- than the legitimisation of their rule .
perhaps that is the reason for this last public step in an election which critics say is already threatening to turn into a farce .
democracy icon behind bars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi : icon of myanmar 's democratic movement opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi is still under house arrest - her party won the elections in 1990 but was never allowed to take power .
suu kyi herself has spent the larger part of the past 20 years in detention .
her current term of house arrest is scheduled to end on november 13 , or a week after the election .
the name of the game 29 million voters will be eligible to vote across 40,000 polling stations , over 3,000 candidates from over 30 parties are contesting the election .
but a quarter of the seats in parliament are reserved for the military , and the election rules are considered to be tilted in favour of the junta 's proxy parties , among them the union solidarity and development party led by prime minister thein sein .
thein sein retired from his military post earlier this year .
and the junta announced last month that voting was being scrapped in parts of the insurgency-plagued ethnic areas , in effect excluding millions from the poll .
the main reason given by election commission chairman thein soe for the exclusion of foreign monitors and media is that " our country has a lot of experience in elections " .
a second reason : diplomats and representatives from un organisations based inside the myanmar will be allowed to observe the voting .
but no photography or filming will be allowed inside the polling stations so that the voters can " cast their votes freely " . ac / afp / reuters editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .

the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .

the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .

" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 18.10.2010 singing rossini is like ' champagne and fireworks , ' says echo winner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joyce didonato has won germany 's prestigious echo klassik award american-born joyce didonato is a star when it comes to italian opera .
after an award-winning year and performances at the salzburger festspiele , the singer talks with dw about what inspires her singing . deutsche welle : your career has led you to many important stages in the world but not to germany .
why is that ? joyce didonato : well , when i started auditioning , my first jobs were in paris , london , milan and amsterdam .
after i would sing there , they invited me back immediately , and my schedule quickly filled up with repeat performances .
now , i have a really strong relationship with the public , especially in paris and london . i did do a very quick and inconsequential debut in munich years ago , but i doubt anyone remembers it .
but i plan to come back many times now .
i 'll be making my debut in berlin this year , so i 'm finally catching up with the rest of the world when it comes to germany . germany 's echo award jury named you classical singer of the year in 2010 for your operatic work .
your focus has been on italian operas - how did that come about ? i have the great fortune of having a voice that has some flexibility to it .
rossini was a very obvious and good match for me .
he also led me to handel and then to the bigger bel canto repertoire . what i 've learned as a musician and artist by singing these composers is tremendous .
there 's nothing worse than this kind of music just being sung as a vocalese with all of the notes in place but not really coming alive .
so i 've had to work very hard to find the ways of making this music important .
my latest cd explored the dramatic side of rossini , and i found a treasure trove of richness and complexity in his writing and characters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rossini should give listeners a certain bubbly sensation , said didonato is italian opera more demanding for you than singing parts from other operatic traditions ? it 's all demanding . -lsb- laughs -rsb- i did n't pick an easy profession . rossini needs to sound like champagne and sound easy - like fireworks just coming out of your mouth - but it takes a lot of work to make that happen .
on the other hand , i 'm singing octavian -lsb- in richard strauss ' " der rosenkavalier " -rsb- this year in madrid , and it 's a tremendous amount of work for me in terms of the language and finding all of those little turns in the character .
so , i find it all challenging but , as a result , rewarding . are these aspects of rossini 's work that you described also part of your personality ? i think they are in some ways .
i have some complexity to me that is not only supported by rossini - there 's some mahler in there too . the only possibility to succeed is to be present in the moment .
if i 'm thinking about the final aria when i start the opera , there 's no way i 'll have a good performance .
really , the only way to create a real character is to be fully in the moment , and that 's something i 've tried to bring into my life . this year at the salzburg festival you performed with one of classical music 's icons , edita gruberova .
what was it like to share the stage with her ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edita gruberova -lrb- pictured -rrb- performed with didonato this year in bellini 's " norma " when i started getting interested in opera - which happened a bit late for me , in my early 20s - she was one of the big names .
she stands at the very top of the legendary singers , and i 'm also not one to bemoan the fact that the golden age of singing is behind us .
we 're living in an exciting age of singers ; however , there is this legendary group of bel canto singers , and gruberova is one of the last in this line of truly exceptional artists . the artists interest me much more than the singers .
i like a pretty sound as much as anyone .

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "

besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

further strikes and nationwide rallies are expected ahead of the final senate vote this week . strikes in france turned violent on monday as high school students joined unions in protesting against president nicolas sarkozy 's unpopular pension reform plan .
youths threw petrol bombs at police outside a school in a paris suburb , and police responded with tear gas as students set cars on fire , smashed bus stops and threw rocks .
further clashes were reported in lyon and the eastern towns of mulhouse and montbeliard , as nearly 300 schools across france were hit by anti-reform protests .
truck drivers also joined the movement on monday , slowing traffic on highways near paris and several regional cities , blocking access to goods supply depots and joining oil workers in blocking fuel depots .
workers at france 's 12 oil refineries are in their seventh day of a strike , which has led to fuel shortages at filling stations across the country .
around 1,500 gas stations had run out of fuel by monday , their industry association said , with panic buying leading to a 50 percent jump in sales last week .
oil workers were determined to keep up their blockades .
" we will stay here as long as we can , " cfdt union 's joseph sieiro , one of the 100 people blocking an oil terminal at port-la-nouvelle in southern france on monday morning , told french news agency afp .

the sncf state rail company said in a statement that one in two high-speed national trains were running on monday .
roissy-charles de gaulle airport in paris , one of europe 's biggest hubs , was also seeing travel disruptions on monday as aircraft refueling staff joined the strike movement .
unions were outraged as management reopened a crucial pipeline to bring fuel to the airport , which officials warned could have run empty as soon as monday .
half of all flights to and from paris orly airport and 30 percent of flights at roissy-charles de gaulle and other french airports are expected to be canceled on tuesday due to continuing strikes , according to aviation officials said .
another day of mass strikes and nationwide protest rallies is planned ahead of a final senate vote on the pension bill on wednesday .
the government has assured the public that infrastructure would not come to a standstill , despite the week-long strike that has brought millions to the streets .
ministers said the country had plenty of fuel reserves , and that airports especially were n't in any danger of running dry .
" the government is in control , " industry minister christian estrosi told rtl radio .
" there will be no blockade for companies , no blockade for transport and no blockade for road users . " on monday , the government activated an emergency government crisis unit charged with maintaining fuel supplies .

the bill has already been approved by the lower house of parliament , and the senate is expected to vote on it on wednesday .
the government hopes to have the bill passed by the end of october .
a majority of french people - 71 percent according to a poll published in the daily le parisien - support the protests .
the opposition socialists have denounced sarkozy and prime minister francois fillon for failing to engage in dialogue over the reforms .
" we have a prime minister who thinks he is churchill but who is only thatcher , " said harlem desir , the party 's deputy leader , referring to britain 's wartime leader and its 1980s conservative premier .
" he is trying to make us think he is carrying out great reforms to save our economy but in fact he is smashing our social model . "

ideas include german language classes and speedier recognition of foreign diplomas . the german government announced plans on monday for legislation to promote the integration of immigrants into mainstream society , following chancellor angela merkel 's assertion on saturday that multiculturalism had " utterly failed . "
" for a while multiculturalism in germany was about immigrants living as they wished and not putting integration too much in the forefront , ” said spokesman steffen seibert at a government press briefing in berlin .
" in everybody 's interest , this society has to act , and the government will act . "
seibert said merkel 's center-right coalition cabinet planned to adopt " concrete " new regulations next wednesday on immigration policy and residency permits .
the legislation would focus on german language courses and combating forced marriages , and make it easier for foreign diplomas to be formally recognized .
the government aims to get the bill passed into law in december .
" this country is extremely glad to have hundreds of thousands , probably millions , of people with foreign roots who are well integrated , " seibert said .
" but we also recognize , and perhaps we are stressing it more now than in years gone by , that with some foreigners integration is not happening as it should .
in some cases it is quite openly being rejected . "
the comments distanced the government from a recent speech by horst seehofer , head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party in bavaria , the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . last week , seehofer warned against further immigration from turkey and arab countries , saying " multiculturalism is dead . "
immigration model similar to canada , australia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle wants germany to follow the lead of canada and australia meanwhile , plans to streamline the process of recognizing foreign qualifications would allow an estimated 300,000 immigrants get jobs in their fields of expertise , said education minister annette schavan in an interview with the financial times deutschland on monday .
" anyone who has studied abroad will be entitled to an equivalent qualification in germany , " she said .
" qualifications from abroad should be evaluated with the same criteria as those obtained in germany . "
economics minister rainer bruederle , of the liberal free democrats , the junior partner in chancellor merkel 's coalition , has proposed an immigration model based on those in canada and australia that would grant permanent residency to foreign applicants whose skills could fill holes in industries experiencing a labor shortage - industries like natural and engineering sciences , computing , nursing and medicine .
" it 's crucial to overcome existing shortages , " bruederle told reporters in berlin on monday .
“ we are not aiming to close our borders to asylum-seekers who fear for their lives .
but it 's legitimate for a country to specifically look for people who can help advance its economy . "
under the current system , immigrants or germans who have earned their qualifications abroad must pass a series of practical and theoretical exams , interviews and evaluations that can often take years to complete .
under the new legislation , which could take effect in 2011 , that period would take no longer than three months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's aging population means fewer workers half a million immigrants needed yearly with an aging population , germany 's pool of qualified labor has long been of concern to employers .
" about 70 percent of german industry is already short of skilled personnel , " said bruederle .
" this is going to worsen as the german population is set to dwindle by five million over the next 20 years .
" it 's estimated that we need up to half a million immigrants every year to fill existing jobs .
so in view of these figures i consider attempts to keep germany closed to foreigners to be foolish . "
bruederle estimates that the german economy lost about 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 20.9 billion -rrb- in 2009 alone due to a shortage of skilled labor .
bruederle 's comments , however , met with criticism from the csu , one of three parties in merkel 's ruling coalition .
" we think such a program is unnecessary , " said alexander dobrindt , the csu 's secretary general .
“ we must first provide unemployed germans with necessary qualifications and get to grips with the integration problems of foreigners already living here .
more foreigners will only lead to more problems integrating them . "

the conference was chaired by german special representative michael steiner . the meeting comes at a moment when , even a month after the parliamentary elections in afghanistan , the outcome has not been declared .
afghanistan 's independent election commission or iec postponed the announcement of preliminary results for the second time over the weekend , calling off a press conference at short notice .
the delay comes as the separate , joint international-afghan electoral complaints commission said it has been reviewing more than 4,000 complaints of fraud .
the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "

besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

the iec 's spokesman , noor mohammad noor , said the results are now due on wednesday .
" the electoral complaints commission should investigate all the electoral complaints , and when this commission informs us that they have investigated all the complaints we will announce the final results of the afghan parliamentary elections . "
how many votes will be declared invalid ?
the iec has said that certain ballots from 571 polling stations , about a tenth of the total , will be disqualified ; and the votes from hundreds of other stations are being checked once again .
no clear figures were given as to how many votes would be cancelled in total .
in last year 's presidential election , 1.5 million votes had been discounted as fraudulent .
according to a report in the new york times , this time the figure might go up to one fourth of the votes cast , or more than one million ballots , in other words .
but one candidate , who preferred not to give his name , clearly thought this was not enough , claiming that " maybe one percent of the votes are real , the remaining are all fake votes gained through fraud . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael steiner , germany 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan ' hype ' about negotiations with the taliban the election and its outcome was one of the issues on the agenda of the afghanistan international contact group in rome on monday .
besides , the international community has mostly been focused on two other issues over the past few weeks : when can afghan forces take over responsibility for at least limited regions in the country ?
and how can reconciliation talks be held with the taliban ?
in an interview on monday , the german government 's special representative for afghanistan , michael steiner , joined those who have been warning of a " hype " , as he put it , regarding such reconciliation talks .
" we should be really careful in dealing with this , " steiner said , " and i 'd ask you to respect that there needs to be a certain discretion .
it is crucial that the afghan government has the leading role in this effort , and we can only support it .
we have to back this process because it is inevitable , but we should n't talk too much about it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke , us special envoy for afghanistan and pakistan ' kickstarting ' transition at a press conference in rome , steiner added that a nato summit in lisbon next month was to " kickstart " the transition process in afghanistan .
his us counterpart richard holbrooke said that general petraeus had presented an " encouraging report " about progress in afghanistan .
but holbrooke also made it clear that the upcoming lisbon meeting was not going to announce a schedule for the transfer of responsibility in certain provinces to afghan forces .
both steiner and holbrooke highlighted the participation by an iranian delegate in rome .
holbrooke said the us recognized that iran had a role to play in a peaceful settlement of the conflict in afghanistan .

he talked with dw about what inspires his work . dw : " dionysos " in salzburg last summer was the second piece you 've premiered by wolfgang rihm .
what fascinates you about his music ? ingo metzmacher : i think it 's a kind of freedom in his music , a freedom of choice , of flow , of language , and also i think he has a very special dramatic sense .
he has a great sense for music theater , so his music really serves the stage .
that 's something i like very much . the opera is about nietzsche .
how well do you know nietzsche and did that aspect pose a challenge for you ? well , when he told me that he was planning to do an opera about nietzsche 's dionysian poems , i was actually very puzzled .
i didn ’ t understand the texts , and i couldn ’ t imagine how to form an opera from them .
rihm has said the words are by nietzsche , but the text is by him .
that is , he used fragments of points here and there that served his narrative purpose in the piece . he created four different scenes that are very dramatic moments in themselves .
for instance , in the first scene , a woman approaches a man and wants to ask if he loves her or not , but he can not speak .
that 's a very existential scene . did his music and text make it easier for you to understand nietzsche 's message ? yes and no .
again he used very specific fragments .
i think what attracted me is that the language is very enigmatic and open , so you can not pin it down .
you can say that about music too .
you can not claim any kind of music means just this and that .
it 's open to many layers of meaning . so , yes , i learned to read nietzsche differently after rihm wrote the language with the music .
sometimes he repeats the sentences or just words for three or four bars as if the flow of text is somehow stuck , and he uses also parodic elements .
it 's fascinating and a very light approach to the whole subject . bildunterschrift : singer johannes martin kraenzle played dionysos in the opera of the same name you developed an interesting concept called the casual concert during your time in berlin .
can you talk more about that ? yeah , it 's a one and a half hour concert - in jeans - at a much lower price .
there 's free seating and explanations from the stage .
it attracted a younger , enthusiastic audience , and i 'm actually sad to leave that form behind because i really liked it . i think one of your big successes was to create special themes and mottos that got attention . yes , and i had at least four or five more themes in my head which i would have loved to continue to do .
especially the series focusing on 1909 , 1911 , 1913 would have interested me a lot because i think those years before the first world war broke out were very exciting .
you know , artists felt that something was dramatically changing , and you can hear it in the music .
i 'll miss getting to do that . you 're well known as innovative - what drives you to create novel ways of presenting performances ? i found out i have a talent for it .
i like to communicate my enthusiasm for any kind of music actually , but i realized that there seems to be a vacuum .
