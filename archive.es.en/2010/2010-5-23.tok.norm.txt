the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .

rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .

for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.05.2010 traditional rome changes course with first modern art museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building makes use of one of rome 's most famous inventions : cement rome is stepping outside its ancient walls into art 's future .
the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls .

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .

the german group arcandor , which owns karstadt , needs a buyer for its 120 department stores - which include berlin 's famous kadewe store - that remain open across germany .
german weekly newspaper bild am sonntag reported that the property group highstreet , of which goldman sachs owns 51 percent , is to present an offer next week of around 40 million euros -lrb- $ 50 million -rrb- .
highstreet already owns many of the buildings that house karstadt stores , which are found in many german city centers .

creditors are also awaiting a decision by city authorities in cologne on whether to waive commercial taxes that they are owed .
cologne is the last of 94 to make a decision on the matter and it is believed that a rejection of the tax remittance could scupper any planned sale .

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.05.2010 traditional rome changes course with first modern art museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building makes use of one of rome 's most famous inventions : cement rome is stepping outside its ancient walls into art 's future .
the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian prime minster vladimir putin told broadcaster mir tv in an interview saturday that the agreement " can not come into full force , " but that he still hoped to speed up negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he would try to accelerate negotiations this year the customs union , in which the three former soviet states would adopt a common external tariff and redistribute the revenue it would bring in , was meant to be a first step in a process to create a free trade agreement and single economic space like the european union by 2012 .
according to a transcript of the putin interview published on a russian government website , putin said he had proposed " to accelerate solving the problems linked to a creation of a single economic space , " and that he would push to complete the necessary documents by the end of this year .
culprits : energy and automobiles putin cited the auto industry and customs tariffs as two " sensitive issues " for the three countries ' economies that have stymied progress .
analysts also say minsk has made the abolition of duties on russian oil exported to belarus a central condition for joining the union - something russia has refused to do .
" we need additional consultations and for experts to agree on ways to bring our positions closer , " said belarus prime minister sergei sidorsky .
" so far this has not happened . "
a formal customs union between russia and belarus already exists , and the new bloc would incorporate energy-rich kazakhstan , which is central asia 's largest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.05.2010 crucial state coalition talks remain an uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft prefers an spd-fdp-green coalition more than two weeks after inconclusive state elections in north rhine-westphalia , the semi-victorious social democrats are still struggling to find a coalition partner and break center-right control in berlin . the return of a " grand coalition " of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- took a step forward in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the five parties elected to state parliament are weighing their options in forming a government .
hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german tv , more than a 100 former bundeswehr soldiers will fight as mercenaries in somalia . former bundeswehr soldiers are to fight as mercenaries in the civil war in somalia , according to german public tv station ndr .
asgaard german security group , a company based in telgte near muenster in northwestern germany , has clinched a deal with somali opposition politician galadod abdinur ahmad darman , who wants to topple the internationally-recognized transitional federal government -lrb- tfg -rrb- in somalia . security experts warn that a somali warlord backed by highly-trained western soldiers could shift the fragile political balance in the east african country and spark a bloodbath .
german interests compromised " if a german company now trains and supports a somali warring faction then it is surely against the interests of the german government , " annette weber , from the german institute for international and security affairs , told ndr .
several german lawmakers have criticized asgaard 's proposed military involvement in africa .
" the contract includes wide-ranging tasks and areas of competence : from strategic planning to security to implementation of all measures that are necessary to restore peace and stability , " said asgaard in a press release .
the company also provides police and military training and logistics .
thomas kaltegaertner , asgaard managing director and a former master sergeant in the bundeswehr , told ndr that the somalia project involved providing armed protection for military , buildings and convoys in the high-risk country .
in a statement , asgaard said it would not act against the interests of the federal republic of germany and would never get into a conflict situation with german armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of people have already been killed in the somali civil war this year " if worst comes to worst , that a patrol or convoy is attacked , the team will take appropriate action " , said kaltegaertner .
ninety-nine percent of the personnel are recruited from germany , he said .
the first contingent is reportedly already on its way to somalia .
the asgaard deployment would potentially put the german ex-soldiers in direct conflict with the tfg 's only protective force , the african union mission to somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- , backed by the united nations .
at a conference in brussels a year ago , the international community pledged $ 213 million -lrb- 172 million euros -rrb- to the besieged tfg and amisom .
eu mission the deal between asgaard and darman , a member of the powerful hawiyes clan in somalia , is especially explosive because the european union has been training somali security forces of the interim government in uganda .
thirteen bundeswehr soldiers are also participating in the european union training mission -lrb- eutm -rrb- in somalia .
darman told ndr that the german mercenaries would be involved in military combat with his militia against pirates , radical islamists and terrorists .
" the government installed by the international community does not have the backing from the country 's population " , said darman .
darman is currently seeking international support for his bid to become president of somalia .

the retail chain 's owners are looking for a buyer after filing for insolvency last year . us banking giant goldman sachs is believed to be putting together an offer to buy germany 's embattled karstadt department store chain .
the german group arcandor , which owns karstadt , needs a buyer for its 120 department stores - which include berlin 's famous kadewe store - that remain open across germany .
german weekly newspaper bild am sonntag reported that the property group highstreet , of which goldman sachs owns 51 percent , is to present an offer next week of around 40 million euros -lrb- $ 50 million -rrb- .
highstreet already owns many of the buildings that house karstadt stores , which are found in many german city centers .

creditors are also awaiting a decision by city authorities in cologne on whether to waive commercial taxes that they are owed .
cologne is the last of 94 to make a decision on the matter and it is believed that a rejection of the tax remittance could scupper any planned sale .

russian prime minster vladimir putin told broadcaster mir tv in an interview saturday that the agreement " can not come into full force , " but that he still hoped to speed up negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he would try to accelerate negotiations this year the customs union , in which the three former soviet states would adopt a common external tariff and redistribute the revenue it would bring in , was meant to be a first step in a process to create a free trade agreement and single economic space like the european union by 2012 .
according to a transcript of the putin interview published on a russian government website , putin said he had proposed " to accelerate solving the problems linked to a creation of a single economic space , " and that he would push to complete the necessary documents by the end of this year .
culprits : energy and automobiles putin cited the auto industry and customs tariffs as two " sensitive issues " for the three countries ' economies that have stymied progress .
analysts also say minsk has made the abolition of duties on russian oil exported to belarus a central condition for joining the union - something russia has refused to do .
" we need additional consultations and for experts to agree on ways to bring our positions closer , " said belarus prime minister sergei sidorsky .
" so far this has not happened . "
a formal customs union between russia and belarus already exists , and the new bloc would incorporate energy-rich kazakhstan , which is central asia 's largest economy .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

russian prime minster vladimir putin told broadcaster mir tv in an interview saturday that the agreement " can not come into full force , " but that he still hoped to speed up negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he would try to accelerate negotiations this year the customs union , in which the three former soviet states would adopt a common external tariff and redistribute the revenue it would bring in , was meant to be a first step in a process to create a free trade agreement and single economic space like the european union by 2012 .
according to a transcript of the putin interview published on a russian government website , putin said he had proposed " to accelerate solving the problems linked to a creation of a single economic space , " and that he would push to complete the necessary documents by the end of this year .
culprits : energy and automobiles putin cited the auto industry and customs tariffs as two " sensitive issues " for the three countries ' economies that have stymied progress .
analysts also say minsk has made the abolition of duties on russian oil exported to belarus a central condition for joining the union - something russia has refused to do .
" we need additional consultations and for experts to agree on ways to bring our positions closer , " said belarus prime minister sergei sidorsky .
" so far this has not happened . "
a formal customs union between russia and belarus already exists , and the new bloc would incorporate energy-rich kazakhstan , which is central asia 's largest economy .
last year , kazakhstan 's neighbors and fellow ex-soviet states tajikistan and kyrgyzstan also expressed interest in joining the union. acb / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier germany fell to sweden in sunday 's bronze medal match in a hard-fought play-off match . the czech republic won the world ice hockey championship in cologne , germany , beating defending champions russia 2-1 in sunday 's final . undefeated since 2007 , russia had been looking for their third successive championship title .
but it was the czechs who got off to a flying start , scoring just 20 seconds into the match through klepis , who fired on an unguarded post . the russian side piled on the pressure but the czech defense remained tight .
a goal for russia was disallowed at the end of the first period . in the second period the czech republic scored a second goal when karel rachunek passed to tomas rolinek in the russian zone to clinch the winner a minute before the end of the second period . russia struck back in the final period , netting a power play goal with just 36 seconds remaining on the clock , but it was not enough to deny the czechs the deserved world title . " we 're obviously upset , " said russian skipper ilya kovalchuk , who was the competition 's top points scorer with 12 from two goals and 10 assists .
" we ca n't accept any other place than first .
we 're deeply disappointed . " bildunterschrift : germany 's team battled hard , but sweden retained the edge germany take fourth place earlier germany missed out on the chance to clinch a bronze medal at the world ice hockey championship in cologne on sunday , succumbing to a 3-1 defeat by sweden .
despite german efforts to level the scores , sweden remained in control throughout the game .
swedish striker magnus paajarvi svensson netted his fifth goal of the tournament , putting the puck past german goalkeeper dinnis endras some three minutes into the match .
for germany , playing in front of a 15,900 crowd at cologne 's lanxess arena , it was a chance to win the country 's first championship medal in more than 50 years .
the swedes remained dominant into the second period but it was german forward alexander bartas who was next to score , firing in a rebound under the crossbar to equalize .
however , sweden moved into the lead once again as jonas andersson beat endras with a sharp-angled shot between the pads .
gamble fails to pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite outward appearances , coach krupp was pleased with his team 's effort german coach uwe krupp substituted endras for a sixth field player with one minute remaining in a bid to equalize once again .
the gamble failed and andersson fired his sixth goal of the tournament into an empty net .
krupp said he would take some time to think about a possible contract extension as coach of the german team .
he also praised his players .
" the strength that we needed was no longer there .
one goal is not enough to win , but the team has played superbly in the tournament , " he said. nrt / rc / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the retail chain 's owners are looking for a buyer after filing for insolvency last year . us banking giant goldman sachs is believed to be putting together an offer to buy germany 's embattled karstadt department store chain .
the german group arcandor , which owns karstadt , needs a buyer for its 120 department stores - which include berlin 's famous kadewe store - that remain open across germany .
german weekly newspaper bild am sonntag reported that the property group highstreet , of which goldman sachs owns 51 percent , is to present an offer next week of around 40 million euros -lrb- $ 50 million -rrb- .
highstreet already owns many of the buildings that house karstadt stores , which are found in many german city centers .

karstadt 's creditors have until may 28 to examine the bids .
creditors are also awaiting a decision by city authorities in cologne on whether to waive commercial taxes that they are owed .
cologne is the last of 94 to make a decision on the matter and it is believed that a rejection of the tax remittance could scupper any planned sale .
arcandor has already been forced to close 13 karstadt stores in light of recent economic pressures. rc / afp / ap / dpa editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the retail chain 's owners are looking for a buyer after filing for insolvency last year . us banking giant goldman sachs is believed to be putting together an offer to buy germany 's embattled karstadt department store chain .
the german group arcandor , which owns karstadt , needs a buyer for its 120 department stores - which include berlin 's famous kadewe store - that remain open across germany .
german weekly newspaper bild am sonntag reported that the property group highstreet , of which goldman sachs owns 51 percent , is to present an offer next week of around 40 million euros -lrb- $ 50 million -rrb- .
highstreet already owns many of the buildings that house karstadt stores , which are found in many german city centers .

karstadt 's creditors have until may 28 to examine the bids .
creditors are also awaiting a decision by city authorities in cologne on whether to waive commercial taxes that they are owed .
cologne is the last of 94 to make a decision on the matter and it is believed that a rejection of the tax remittance could scupper any planned sale .

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german tv , more than a 100 former bundeswehr soldiers will fight as mercenaries in somalia . former bundeswehr soldiers are to fight as mercenaries in the civil war in somalia , according to german public tv station ndr .
asgaard german security group , a company based in telgte near muenster in northwestern germany , has clinched a deal with somali opposition politician galadod abdinur ahmad darman , who wants to topple the internationally-recognized transitional federal government -lrb- tfg -rrb- in somalia . security experts warn that a somali warlord backed by highly-trained western soldiers could shift the fragile political balance in the east african country and spark a bloodbath .
german interests compromised " if a german company now trains and supports a somali warring faction then it is surely against the interests of the german government , " annette weber , from the german institute for international and security affairs , told ndr .
several german lawmakers have criticized asgaard 's proposed military involvement in africa .
" the contract includes wide-ranging tasks and areas of competence : from strategic planning to security to implementation of all measures that are necessary to restore peace and stability , " said asgaard in a press release .
the company also provides police and military training and logistics .
thomas kaltegaertner , asgaard managing director and a former master sergeant in the bundeswehr , told ndr that the somalia project involved providing armed protection for military , buildings and convoys in the high-risk country .

darman told ndr that the german mercenaries would be involved in military combat with his militia against pirates , radical islamists and terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.05.2010 german government proposes benefit cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to make big cuts to reduce its deficit while germany 's social welfare system is one of its proudest features , it is also one of its most expensive .
under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier germany fell to sweden in sunday 's bronze medal match in a hard-fought play-off match . the czech republic won the world ice hockey championship in cologne , germany , beating defending champions russia 2-1 in sunday 's final . undefeated since 2007 , russia had been looking for their third successive championship title .
but it was the czechs who got off to a flying start , scoring just 20 seconds into the match through klepis , who fired on an unguarded post . the russian side piled on the pressure but the czech defense remained tight .
a goal for russia was disallowed at the end of the first period . in the second period the czech republic scored a second goal when karel rachunek passed to tomas rolinek in the russian zone to clinch the winner a minute before the end of the second period . russia struck back in the final period , netting a power play goal with just 36 seconds remaining on the clock , but it was not enough to deny the czechs the deserved world title . " we 're obviously upset , " said russian skipper ilya kovalchuk , who was the competition 's top points scorer with 12 from two goals and 10 assists .
" we ca n't accept any other place than first .

" bildunterschrift : germany 's team battled hard , but sweden retained the edge germany take fourth place earlier germany missed out on the chance to clinch a bronze medal at the world ice hockey championship in cologne on sunday , succumbing to a 3-1 defeat by sweden .

swedish striker magnus paajarvi svensson netted his fifth goal of the tournament , putting the puck past german goalkeeper dinnis endras some three minutes into the match .
for germany , playing in front of a 15,900 crowd at cologne 's lanxess arena , it was a chance to win the country 's first championship medal in more than 50 years .
the swedes remained dominant into the second period but it was german forward alexander bartas who was next to score , firing in a rebound under the crossbar to equalize .
however , sweden moved into the lead once again as jonas andersson beat endras with a sharp-angled shot between the pads .
gamble fails to pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite outward appearances , coach krupp was pleased with his team 's effort german coach uwe krupp substituted endras for a sixth field player with one minute remaining in a bid to equalize once again .
the gamble failed and andersson fired his sixth goal of the tournament into an empty net .
krupp said he would take some time to think about a possible contract extension as coach of the german team .
he also praised his players .
" the strength that we needed was no longer there .
one goal is not enough to win , but the team has played superbly in the tournament , " he said. nrt / rc / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the retail chain 's owners are looking for a buyer after filing for insolvency last year . us banking giant goldman sachs is believed to be putting together an offer to buy germany 's embattled karstadt department store chain .
the german group arcandor , which owns karstadt , needs a buyer for its 120 department stores - which include berlin 's famous kadewe store - that remain open across germany .
german weekly newspaper bild am sonntag reported that the property group highstreet , of which goldman sachs owns 51 percent , is to present an offer next week of around 40 million euros -lrb- $ 50 million -rrb- .
highstreet already owns many of the buildings that house karstadt stores , which are found in many german city centers .

creditors are also awaiting a decision by city authorities in cologne on whether to waive commercial taxes that they are owed .
cologne is the last of 94 to make a decision on the matter and it is believed that a rejection of the tax remittance could scupper any planned sale .

" so long , productivity !
hooray facebook and hotmail ! " wrote one air force member from his work computer shortly after the system was opened up at the beginning of may .
" i am literally at work , next to classified material posting this - what a great move air force ! ! " was another airman 's reaction on facebook .
but some saw it more positively .
" i am too busy to surf -lsb- social media sites -rsb- too much .
i am sure marines are online all day .
at times , it 's the only way to communicate when military means are down , " one us marine admitted .
enjoy yourself in the uk , the ministry of defense took a proactive approach to social media for the troops last summer .
its online engagement guidelines and other policies encourage troops to interact online .
along with reminders to " maintain security " and " think about reputation " the ministry of defense delivers a friendlier message , " enjoy yourself - you have a great story to tell , and are the best person to tell it . "
british soldiers are even being asked to create social media presences as part of their official duties , in order to explain their work to the public , the ministry 's website said .
" it 's about training and educating and advising our people - just like you do n't talk about certain things down the pub , likewise you should n't talk about certain things online , " robin riley , the head of online engagement , was quoted as saying .
hands off approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers can not access social media sites except from deployed locations in germany , there have been few similar revelations regarding social networking websites .
the bundeswehr has never dictated the proper use of online platforms .
" we have no written policy like the us and the british have , " spokesman commander klaus tautges told deutsche welle .
instead , the soldiers of the bundeswehr are bound by the overarching soldatengesetz , the statute dictating the rights and responsibilities of the german military members .
" soldiers are legally obligated to have discretion when speaking about duty-related issues and to maintain the reputation of the bundeswehr in public , " tautges said .
with only a few exceptions , the german military has managed not to abuse the trust placed in it by its leaders .
access to social media websites is not usually allowed on duty computers , except in morale and welfare centers in deployed locations .
" we try to educate but not to regulate , so they can use these networks carefully and with respect , " tautges said .
teach a man to tweet education seems to be the compromise that most military forces are embracing , backed up by laws such as the soldatengesetz in germany and the uniform code of military justice in the us .
a pamphlet published by the us air force provides a list of tips for airmen using social media : do n't give away classified information .
do n't lie : credibility is critical , without it no one cares what you have to say .
use common sense - if you would n't say it front of your mother , do n't say it online .
the most important lesson to many soldiers , however , is the final tip : the enemy is engaged in this battle space , you must engage there as well .

some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

" so long , productivity !
hooray facebook and hotmail ! " wrote one air force member from his work computer shortly after the system was opened up at the beginning of may .
" i am literally at work , next to classified material posting this - what a great move air force ! ! " was another airman 's reaction on facebook .
but some saw it more positively .
" i am too busy to surf -lsb- social media sites -rsb- too much .
i am sure marines are online all day .
at times , it 's the only way to communicate when military means are down , " one us marine admitted .
enjoy yourself in the uk , the ministry of defense took a proactive approach to social media for the troops last summer .
its online engagement guidelines and other policies encourage troops to interact online .
along with reminders to " maintain security " and " think about reputation " the ministry of defense delivers a friendlier message , " enjoy yourself - you have a great story to tell , and are the best person to tell it . "
british soldiers are even being asked to create social media presences as part of their official duties , in order to explain their work to the public , the ministry 's website said .
" it 's about training and educating and advising our people - just like you do n't talk about certain things down the pub , likewise you should n't talk about certain things online , " robin riley , the head of online engagement , was quoted as saying .
hands off approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers can not access social media sites except from deployed locations in germany , there have been few similar revelations regarding social networking websites .
the bundeswehr has never dictated the proper use of online platforms .
" we have no written policy like the us and the british have , " spokesman commander klaus tautges told deutsche welle .
instead , the soldiers of the bundeswehr are bound by the overarching soldatengesetz , the statute dictating the rights and responsibilities of the german military members .
" soldiers are legally obligated to have discretion when speaking about duty-related issues and to maintain the reputation of the bundeswehr in public , " tautges said .
with only a few exceptions , the german military has managed not to abuse the trust placed in it by its leaders .
access to social media websites is not usually allowed on duty computers , except in morale and welfare centers in deployed locations .
" we try to educate but not to regulate , so they can use these networks carefully and with respect , " tautges said .
teach a man to tweet education seems to be the compromise that most military forces are embracing , backed up by laws such as the soldatengesetz in germany and the uniform code of military justice in the us .
a pamphlet published by the us air force provides a list of tips for airmen using social media : do n't give away classified information .
do n't lie : credibility is critical , without it no one cares what you have to say .
use common sense - if you would n't say it front of your mother , do n't say it online .
the most important lesson to many soldiers , however , is the final tip : the enemy is engaged in this battle space , you must engage there as well .

the retail chain 's owners are looking for a buyer after filing for insolvency last year . us banking giant goldman sachs is believed to be putting together an offer to buy germany 's embattled karstadt department store chain .
the german group arcandor , which owns karstadt , needs a buyer for its 120 department stores - which include berlin 's famous kadewe store - that remain open across germany .
german weekly newspaper bild am sonntag reported that the property group highstreet , of which goldman sachs owns 51 percent , is to present an offer next week of around 40 million euros -lrb- $ 50 million -rrb- .
highstreet already owns many of the buildings that house karstadt stores , which are found in many german city centers .

karstadt 's creditors have until may 28 to examine the bids .
creditors are also awaiting a decision by city authorities in cologne on whether to waive commercial taxes that they are owed .
cologne is the last of 94 to make a decision on the matter and it is believed that a rejection of the tax remittance could scupper any planned sale .

" the coming months will be crucial , " said westerwelle .
" we ask the parties to move from proximity talks to direct negotiations as a sole path that leads to the two-state solution and stability in the middle east . "
westerwelle said germany remained committed to " close coordination " with the us middle east envoy george mitchell , who is conducting the proximity talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us middle east envoy george mitchell is brokering talks between the israelis and palestinians he said that his middle east trip , which began on friday , was aimed at " probing the possible german contributions to efforts for pushing forward the peace process .

jordan was the third stop in the foreign minister 's current middle east tour after previous visits to lebanon and egypt .
earlier in the day , he met with jordan 's king abdullah ii .
importance of neighbors following his visit to jordan , westerwelle arrived in damascus where he emphasized the importance of syria 's role in peace negotiations .
he said the country was indispensable for achieving a " constructive solution " in the region .
" whoever wishes to support the peace process in the middle east must also seek talks with syria , " westerwelle said after meeting syrian president bashar al-assad .
following earlier meetings in egypt with egyptian president hosni mubarak , westerwelle stressed the importance of " goodwill " on the part of all parties with a role to play in paving the way for peace .
westerwelle said mubarak was a " man of great wisdom " who remained focused on the future following talks in cairo .
westerwelle praised egypt 's efforts in talks with palestinians , which he said " would lead to more stability in the region . "

german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased by prussia in 1913 .
westerwelle ruled out a loan of the bust to egypt saying it was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle said that there was no reason that a dispute over the ownership of the bust should drive a wedge between the countries. rc / afp / dpa / ap editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .

there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .

the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .

but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.05.2010 german government proposes benefit cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to make big cuts to reduce its deficit while germany 's social welfare system is one of its proudest features , it is also one of its most expensive .
under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 23.05.2010 loose tweets sink fleets : soldiering in the internet era 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as more troops communicate with tools like twitter , military leaders seek to educate them military commanders are coming to terms with the fact that most of their troops use social networking sites like facebook .
some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .

in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

" so long , productivity !
hooray facebook and hotmail ! " wrote one air force member from his work computer shortly after the system was opened up at the beginning of may .
" i am literally at work , next to classified material posting this - what a great move air force ! ! " was another airman 's reaction on facebook .
but some saw it more positively .
" i am too busy to surf -lsb- social media sites -rsb- too much .
i am sure marines are online all day .
at times , it 's the only way to communicate when military means are down , " one us marine admitted .
enjoy yourself in the uk , the ministry of defense took a proactive approach to social media for the troops last summer .
its online engagement guidelines and other policies encourage troops to interact online .
along with reminders to " maintain security " and " think about reputation " the ministry of defense delivers a friendlier message , " enjoy yourself - you have a great story to tell , and are the best person to tell it . "
british soldiers are even being asked to create social media presences as part of their official duties , in order to explain their work to the public , the ministry 's website said .
" it 's about training and educating and advising our people - just like you do n't talk about certain things down the pub , likewise you should n't talk about certain things online , " robin riley , the head of online engagement , was quoted as saying .
hands off approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers can not access social media sites except from deployed locations in germany , there have been few similar revelations regarding social networking websites .
the bundeswehr has never dictated the proper use of online platforms .
" we have no written policy like the us and the british have , " spokesman commander klaus tautges told deutsche welle .
instead , the soldiers of the bundeswehr are bound by the overarching soldatengesetz , the statute dictating the rights and responsibilities of the german military members .
" soldiers are legally obligated to have discretion when speaking about duty-related issues and to maintain the reputation of the bundeswehr in public , " tautges said .
with only a few exceptions , the german military has managed not to abuse the trust placed in it by its leaders .
access to social media websites is not usually allowed on duty computers , except in morale and welfare centers in deployed locations .
" we try to educate but not to regulate , so they can use these networks carefully and with respect , " tautges said .
teach a man to tweet education seems to be the compromise that most military forces are embracing , backed up by laws such as the soldatengesetz in germany and the uniform code of military justice in the us .
a pamphlet published by the us air force provides a list of tips for airmen using social media : do n't give away classified information .
do n't lie : credibility is critical , without it no one cares what you have to say .
use common sense - if you would n't say it front of your mother , do n't say it online .
the most important lesson to many soldiers , however , is the final tip : the enemy is engaged in this battle space , you must engage there as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 23.05.2010 loose tweets sink fleets : soldiering in the internet era 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as more troops communicate with tools like twitter , military leaders seek to educate them military commanders are coming to terms with the fact that most of their troops use social networking sites like facebook .
some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .

professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .

some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .

according to german tv , more than a 100 former bundeswehr soldiers will fight as mercenaries in somalia . former bundeswehr soldiers are to fight as mercenaries in the civil war in somalia , according to german public tv station ndr .
asgaard german security group , a company based in telgte near muenster in northwestern germany , has clinched a deal with somali opposition politician galadod abdinur ahmad darman , who wants to topple the internationally-recognized transitional federal government -lrb- tfg -rrb- in somalia . security experts warn that a somali warlord backed by highly-trained western soldiers could shift the fragile political balance in the east african country and spark a bloodbath .
german interests compromised " if a german company now trains and supports a somali warring faction then it is surely against the interests of the german government , " annette weber , from the german institute for international and security affairs , told ndr .
several german lawmakers have criticized asgaard 's proposed military involvement in africa .
" the contract includes wide-ranging tasks and areas of competence : from strategic planning to security to implementation of all measures that are necessary to restore peace and stability , " said asgaard in a press release .
the company also provides police and military training and logistics .
thomas kaltegaertner , asgaard managing director and a former master sergeant in the bundeswehr , told ndr that the somalia project involved providing armed protection for military , buildings and convoys in the high-risk country .

darman told ndr that the german mercenaries would be involved in military combat with his militia against pirates , radical islamists and terrorists .

according to german tv , more than a 100 former bundeswehr soldiers will fight as mercenaries in somalia . former bundeswehr soldiers are to fight as mercenaries in the civil war in somalia , according to german public tv station ndr .
asgaard german security group , a company based in telgte near muenster in northwestern germany , has clinched a deal with somali opposition politician galadod abdinur ahmad darman , who wants to topple the internationally-recognized transitional federal government -lrb- tfg -rrb- in somalia . security experts warn that a somali warlord backed by highly-trained western soldiers could shift the fragile political balance in the east african country and spark a bloodbath .
german interests compromised " if a german company now trains and supports a somali warring faction then it is surely against the interests of the german government , " annette weber , from the german institute for international and security affairs , told ndr .
several german lawmakers have criticized asgaard 's proposed military involvement in africa .
" the contract includes wide-ranging tasks and areas of competence : from strategic planning to security to implementation of all measures that are necessary to restore peace and stability , " said asgaard in a press release .
the company also provides police and military training and logistics .
thomas kaltegaertner , asgaard managing director and a former master sergeant in the bundeswehr , told ndr that the somalia project involved providing armed protection for military , buildings and convoys in the high-risk country .
in a statement , asgaard said it would not act against the interests of the federal republic of germany and would never get into a conflict situation with german armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of people have already been killed in the somali civil war this year " if worst comes to worst , that a patrol or convoy is attacked , the team will take appropriate action " , said kaltegaertner .
ninety-nine percent of the personnel are recruited from germany , he said .
the first contingent is reportedly already on its way to somalia .
the asgaard deployment would potentially put the german ex-soldiers in direct conflict with the tfg 's only protective force , the african union mission to somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- , backed by the united nations .
at a conference in brussels a year ago , the international community pledged $ 213 million -lrb- 172 million euros -rrb- to the besieged tfg and amisom .
eu mission the deal between asgaard and darman , a member of the powerful hawiyes clan in somalia , is especially explosive because the european union has been training somali security forces of the interim government in uganda .
thirteen bundeswehr soldiers are also participating in the european union training mission -lrb- eutm -rrb- in somalia .
darman told ndr that the german mercenaries would be involved in military combat with his militia against pirates , radical islamists and terrorists .
" the government installed by the international community does not have the backing from the country 's population " , said darman .
darman is currently seeking international support for his bid to become president of somalia .
no prior knowledge the german foreign ministry acknowledged that it knew nothing about the contract and the activities of asgaard germany security group .
the defense ministry also confirmed that it has never entered into any contractual agreement with the company .
rainer stinne , a fdp foreign policy expert , said asgaard should be made accountable because the contract violated un sanctions. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german tv , more than a 100 former bundeswehr soldiers will fight as mercenaries in somalia . former bundeswehr soldiers are to fight as mercenaries in the civil war in somalia , according to german public tv station ndr .
asgaard german security group , a company based in telgte near muenster in northwestern germany , has clinched a deal with somali opposition politician galadod abdinur ahmad darman , who wants to topple the internationally-recognized transitional federal government -lrb- tfg -rrb- in somalia . security experts warn that a somali warlord backed by highly-trained western soldiers could shift the fragile political balance in the east african country and spark a bloodbath .
german interests compromised " if a german company now trains and supports a somali warring faction then it is surely against the interests of the german government , " annette weber , from the german institute for international and security affairs , told ndr .
several german lawmakers have criticized asgaard 's proposed military involvement in africa .
" the contract includes wide-ranging tasks and areas of competence : from strategic planning to security to implementation of all measures that are necessary to restore peace and stability , " said asgaard in a press release .
the company also provides police and military training and logistics .
thomas kaltegaertner , asgaard managing director and a former master sergeant in the bundeswehr , told ndr that the somalia project involved providing armed protection for military , buildings and convoys in the high-risk country .
in a statement , asgaard said it would not act against the interests of the federal republic of germany and would never get into a conflict situation with german armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of people have already been killed in the somali civil war this year " if worst comes to worst , that a patrol or convoy is attacked , the team will take appropriate action " , said kaltegaertner .
ninety-nine percent of the personnel are recruited from germany , he said .
the first contingent is reportedly already on its way to somalia .
the asgaard deployment would potentially put the german ex-soldiers in direct conflict with the tfg 's only protective force , the african union mission to somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- , backed by the united nations .
at a conference in brussels a year ago , the international community pledged $ 213 million -lrb- 172 million euros -rrb- to the besieged tfg and amisom .
eu mission the deal between asgaard and darman , a member of the powerful hawiyes clan in somalia , is especially explosive because the european union has been training somali security forces of the interim government in uganda .
thirteen bundeswehr soldiers are also participating in the european union training mission -lrb- eutm -rrb- in somalia .
darman told ndr that the german mercenaries would be involved in military combat with his militia against pirates , radical islamists and terrorists .
" the government installed by the international community does not have the backing from the country 's population " , said darman .
darman is currently seeking international support for his bid to become president of somalia .
no prior knowledge the german foreign ministry acknowledged that it knew nothing about the contract and the activities of asgaard germany security group .
the defense ministry also confirmed that it has never entered into any contractual agreement with the company .
rainer stinne , a fdp foreign policy expert , said asgaard should be made accountable because the contract violated un sanctions. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "

the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .

earlier germany fell to sweden in sunday 's bronze medal match in a hard-fought play-off match . the czech republic won the world ice hockey championship in cologne , germany , beating defending champions russia 2-1 in sunday 's final . undefeated since 2007 , russia had been looking for their third successive championship title .
but it was the czechs who got off to a flying start , scoring just 20 seconds into the match through klepis , who fired on an unguarded post . the russian side piled on the pressure but the czech defense remained tight .
a goal for russia was disallowed at the end of the first period . in the second period the czech republic scored a second goal when karel rachunek passed to tomas rolinek in the russian zone to clinch the winner a minute before the end of the second period . russia struck back in the final period , netting a power play goal with just 36 seconds remaining on the clock , but it was not enough to deny the czechs the deserved world title . " we 're obviously upset , " said russian skipper ilya kovalchuk , who was the competition 's top points scorer with 12 from two goals and 10 assists .
" we ca n't accept any other place than first .

swedish striker magnus paajarvi svensson netted his fifth goal of the tournament , putting the puck past german goalkeeper dinnis endras some three minutes into the match .
for germany , playing in front of a 15,900 crowd at cologne 's lanxess arena , it was a chance to win the country 's first championship medal in more than 50 years .
the swedes remained dominant into the second period but it was german forward alexander bartas who was next to score , firing in a rebound under the crossbar to equalize .
however , sweden moved into the lead once again as jonas andersson beat endras with a sharp-angled shot between the pads .
gamble fails to pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite outward appearances , coach krupp was pleased with his team 's effort german coach uwe krupp substituted endras for a sixth field player with one minute remaining in a bid to equalize once again .
the gamble failed and andersson fired his sixth goal of the tournament into an empty net .
krupp said he would take some time to think about a possible contract extension as coach of the german team .
he also praised his players .
" the strength that we needed was no longer there .
one goal is not enough to win , but the team has played superbly in the tournament , " he said. nrt / rc / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .

indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .

but some saw it more positively .
" i am too busy to surf -lsb- social media sites -rsb- too much .
i am sure marines are online all day .
at times , it 's the only way to communicate when military means are down , " one us marine admitted .
enjoy yourself in the uk , the ministry of defense took a proactive approach to social media for the troops last summer .
its online engagement guidelines and other policies encourage troops to interact online .
along with reminders to " maintain security " and " think about reputation " the ministry of defense delivers a friendlier message , " enjoy yourself - you have a great story to tell , and are the best person to tell it . "
british soldiers are even being asked to create social media presences as part of their official duties , in order to explain their work to the public , the ministry 's website said .
" it 's about training and educating and advising our people - just like you do n't talk about certain things down the pub , likewise you should n't talk about certain things online , " robin riley , the head of online engagement , was quoted as saying .
hands off approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers can not access social media sites except from deployed locations in germany , there have been few similar revelations regarding social networking websites .
the bundeswehr has never dictated the proper use of online platforms .
" we have no written policy like the us and the british have , " spokesman commander klaus tautges told deutsche welle .
instead , the soldiers of the bundeswehr are bound by the overarching soldatengesetz , the statute dictating the rights and responsibilities of the german military members .
" soldiers are legally obligated to have discretion when speaking about duty-related issues and to maintain the reputation of the bundeswehr in public , " tautges said .
with only a few exceptions , the german military has managed not to abuse the trust placed in it by its leaders .
access to social media websites is not usually allowed on duty computers , except in morale and welfare centers in deployed locations .
" we try to educate but not to regulate , so they can use these networks carefully and with respect , " tautges said .
teach a man to tweet education seems to be the compromise that most military forces are embracing , backed up by laws such as the soldatengesetz in germany and the uniform code of military justice in the us .
a pamphlet published by the us air force provides a list of tips for airmen using social media : do n't give away classified information .
do n't lie : credibility is critical , without it no one cares what you have to say .
use common sense - if you would n't say it front of your mother , do n't say it online .
the most important lesson to many soldiers , however , is the final tip : the enemy is engaged in this battle space , you must engage there as well .

some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

" so long , productivity !
hooray facebook and hotmail ! " wrote one air force member from his work computer shortly after the system was opened up at the beginning of may .
" i am literally at work , next to classified material posting this - what a great move air force ! ! " was another airman 's reaction on facebook .
but some saw it more positively .
" i am too busy to surf -lsb- social media sites -rsb- too much .
i am sure marines are online all day .
at times , it 's the only way to communicate when military means are down , " one us marine admitted .
enjoy yourself in the uk , the ministry of defense took a proactive approach to social media for the troops last summer .
its online engagement guidelines and other policies encourage troops to interact online .
along with reminders to " maintain security " and " think about reputation " the ministry of defense delivers a friendlier message , " enjoy yourself - you have a great story to tell , and are the best person to tell it . "
british soldiers are even being asked to create social media presences as part of their official duties , in order to explain their work to the public , the ministry 's website said .
" it 's about training and educating and advising our people - just like you do n't talk about certain things down the pub , likewise you should n't talk about certain things online , " robin riley , the head of online engagement , was quoted as saying .
hands off approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers can not access social media sites except from deployed locations in germany , there have been few similar revelations regarding social networking websites .
the bundeswehr has never dictated the proper use of online platforms .
" we have no written policy like the us and the british have , " spokesman commander klaus tautges told deutsche welle .
instead , the soldiers of the bundeswehr are bound by the overarching soldatengesetz , the statute dictating the rights and responsibilities of the german military members .
" soldiers are legally obligated to have discretion when speaking about duty-related issues and to maintain the reputation of the bundeswehr in public , " tautges said .
with only a few exceptions , the german military has managed not to abuse the trust placed in it by its leaders .
access to social media websites is not usually allowed on duty computers , except in morale and welfare centers in deployed locations .
" we try to educate but not to regulate , so they can use these networks carefully and with respect , " tautges said .
teach a man to tweet education seems to be the compromise that most military forces are embracing , backed up by laws such as the soldatengesetz in germany and the uniform code of military justice in the us .
a pamphlet published by the us air force provides a list of tips for airmen using social media : do n't give away classified information .
do n't lie : credibility is critical , without it no one cares what you have to say .
use common sense - if you would n't say it front of your mother , do n't say it online .
the most important lesson to many soldiers , however , is the final tip : the enemy is engaged in this battle space , you must engage there as well .

in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.05.2010 traditional rome changes course with first modern art museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building makes use of one of rome 's most famous inventions : cement rome is stepping outside its ancient walls into art 's future .
the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .

" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .

ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.05.2010 traditional rome changes course with first modern art museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building makes use of one of rome 's most famous inventions : cement rome is stepping outside its ancient walls into art 's future .
the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .

the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original .

the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

according to german tv , more than a 100 former bundeswehr soldiers will fight as mercenaries in somalia . former bundeswehr soldiers are to fight as mercenaries in the civil war in somalia , according to german public tv station ndr .
asgaard german security group , a company based in telgte near muenster in northwestern germany , has clinched a deal with somali opposition politician galadod abdinur ahmad darman , who wants to topple the internationally-recognized transitional federal government -lrb- tfg -rrb- in somalia . security experts warn that a somali warlord backed by highly-trained western soldiers could shift the fragile political balance in the east african country and spark a bloodbath .
german interests compromised " if a german company now trains and supports a somali warring faction then it is surely against the interests of the german government , " annette weber , from the german institute for international and security affairs , told ndr .
several german lawmakers have criticized asgaard 's proposed military involvement in africa .
" the contract includes wide-ranging tasks and areas of competence : from strategic planning to security to implementation of all measures that are necessary to restore peace and stability , " said asgaard in a press release .
the company also provides police and military training and logistics .
thomas kaltegaertner , asgaard managing director and a former master sergeant in the bundeswehr , told ndr that the somalia project involved providing armed protection for military , buildings and convoys in the high-risk country .
in a statement , asgaard said it would not act against the interests of the federal republic of germany and would never get into a conflict situation with german armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of people have already been killed in the somali civil war this year " if worst comes to worst , that a patrol or convoy is attacked , the team will take appropriate action " , said kaltegaertner .
ninety-nine percent of the personnel are recruited from germany , he said .
the first contingent is reportedly already on its way to somalia .
the asgaard deployment would potentially put the german ex-soldiers in direct conflict with the tfg 's only protective force , the african union mission to somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- , backed by the united nations .
at a conference in brussels a year ago , the international community pledged $ 213 million -lrb- 172 million euros -rrb- to the besieged tfg and amisom .
eu mission the deal between asgaard and darman , a member of the powerful hawiyes clan in somalia , is especially explosive because the european union has been training somali security forces of the interim government in uganda .
thirteen bundeswehr soldiers are also participating in the european union training mission -lrb- eutm -rrb- in somalia .
darman told ndr that the german mercenaries would be involved in military combat with his militia against pirates , radical islamists and terrorists .
" the government installed by the international community does not have the backing from the country 's population " , said darman .
darman is currently seeking international support for his bid to become president of somalia .
no prior knowledge the german foreign ministry acknowledged that it knew nothing about the contract and the activities of asgaard germany security group .
the defense ministry also confirmed that it has never entered into any contractual agreement with the company .
rainer stinne , a fdp foreign policy expert , said asgaard should be made accountable because the contract violated un sanctions. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.05.2010 german government proposes benefit cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to make big cuts to reduce its deficit while germany 's social welfare system is one of its proudest features , it is also one of its most expensive .
under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.05.2010 crucial state coalition talks remain an uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft prefers an spd-fdp-green coalition more than two weeks after inconclusive state elections in north rhine-westphalia , the semi-victorious social democrats are still struggling to find a coalition partner and break center-right control in berlin . the return of a " grand coalition " of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- took a step forward in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the five parties elected to state parliament are weighing their options in forming a government .
hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

" " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .

the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .

the retail chain 's owners are looking for a buyer after filing for insolvency last year . us banking giant goldman sachs is believed to be putting together an offer to buy germany 's embattled karstadt department store chain .
the german group arcandor , which owns karstadt , needs a buyer for its 120 department stores - which include berlin 's famous kadewe store - that remain open across germany .
german weekly newspaper bild am sonntag reported that the property group highstreet , of which goldman sachs owns 51 percent , is to present an offer next week of around 40 million euros -lrb- $ 50 million -rrb- .
highstreet already owns many of the buildings that house karstadt stores , which are found in many german city centers .

creditors are also awaiting a decision by city authorities in cologne on whether to waive commercial taxes that they are owed .
cologne is the last of 94 to make a decision on the matter and it is believed that a rejection of the tax remittance could scupper any planned sale .

earlier germany fell to sweden in sunday 's bronze medal match in a hard-fought play-off match . the czech republic won the world ice hockey championship in cologne , germany , beating defending champions russia 2-1 in sunday 's final . undefeated since 2007 , russia had been looking for their third successive championship title .
but it was the czechs who got off to a flying start , scoring just 20 seconds into the match through klepis , who fired on an unguarded post . the russian side piled on the pressure but the czech defense remained tight .
a goal for russia was disallowed at the end of the first period . in the second period the czech republic scored a second goal when karel rachunek passed to tomas rolinek in the russian zone to clinch the winner a minute before the end of the second period . russia struck back in the final period , netting a power play goal with just 36 seconds remaining on the clock , but it was not enough to deny the czechs the deserved world title . " we 're obviously upset , " said russian skipper ilya kovalchuk , who was the competition 's top points scorer with 12 from two goals and 10 assists .
" we ca n't accept any other place than first .
we 're deeply disappointed . " bildunterschrift : germany 's team battled hard , but sweden retained the edge germany take fourth place earlier germany missed out on the chance to clinch a bronze medal at the world ice hockey championship in cologne on sunday , succumbing to a 3-1 defeat by sweden .
despite german efforts to level the scores , sweden remained in control throughout the game .
swedish striker magnus paajarvi svensson netted his fifth goal of the tournament , putting the puck past german goalkeeper dinnis endras some three minutes into the match .
for germany , playing in front of a 15,900 crowd at cologne 's lanxess arena , it was a chance to win the country 's first championship medal in more than 50 years .
the swedes remained dominant into the second period but it was german forward alexander bartas who was next to score , firing in a rebound under the crossbar to equalize .
however , sweden moved into the lead once again as jonas andersson beat endras with a sharp-angled shot between the pads .
gamble fails to pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite outward appearances , coach krupp was pleased with his team 's effort german coach uwe krupp substituted endras for a sixth field player with one minute remaining in a bid to equalize once again .
the gamble failed and andersson fired his sixth goal of the tournament into an empty net .
krupp said he would take some time to think about a possible contract extension as coach of the german team .
he also praised his players .
" the strength that we needed was no longer there .
one goal is not enough to win , but the team has played superbly in the tournament , " he said. nrt / rc / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier germany fell to sweden in sunday 's bronze medal match in a hard-fought play-off match . the czech republic won the world ice hockey championship in cologne , germany , beating defending champions russia 2-1 in sunday 's final . undefeated since 2007 , russia had been looking for their third successive championship title .
but it was the czechs who got off to a flying start , scoring just 20 seconds into the match through klepis , who fired on an unguarded post . the russian side piled on the pressure but the czech defense remained tight .
a goal for russia was disallowed at the end of the first period . in the second period the czech republic scored a second goal when karel rachunek passed to tomas rolinek in the russian zone to clinch the winner a minute before the end of the second period . russia struck back in the final period , netting a power play goal with just 36 seconds remaining on the clock , but it was not enough to deny the czechs the deserved world title . " we 're obviously upset , " said russian skipper ilya kovalchuk , who was the competition 's top points scorer with 12 from two goals and 10 assists .
" we ca n't accept any other place than first .
we 're deeply disappointed . " bildunterschrift : germany 's team battled hard , but sweden retained the edge germany take fourth place earlier germany missed out on the chance to clinch a bronze medal at the world ice hockey championship in cologne on sunday , succumbing to a 3-1 defeat by sweden .
despite german efforts to level the scores , sweden remained in control throughout the game .
swedish striker magnus paajarvi svensson netted his fifth goal of the tournament , putting the puck past german goalkeeper dinnis endras some three minutes into the match .
for germany , playing in front of a 15,900 crowd at cologne 's lanxess arena , it was a chance to win the country 's first championship medal in more than 50 years .
the swedes remained dominant into the second period but it was german forward alexander bartas who was next to score , firing in a rebound under the crossbar to equalize .
however , sweden moved into the lead once again as jonas andersson beat endras with a sharp-angled shot between the pads .
gamble fails to pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite outward appearances , coach krupp was pleased with his team 's effort german coach uwe krupp substituted endras for a sixth field player with one minute remaining in a bid to equalize once again .
the gamble failed and andersson fired his sixth goal of the tournament into an empty net .
krupp said he would take some time to think about a possible contract extension as coach of the german team .
he also praised his players .
" the strength that we needed was no longer there .
one goal is not enough to win , but the team has played superbly in the tournament , " he said. nrt / rc / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

according to german tv , more than a 100 former bundeswehr soldiers will fight as mercenaries in somalia . former bundeswehr soldiers are to fight as mercenaries in the civil war in somalia , according to german public tv station ndr .
asgaard german security group , a company based in telgte near muenster in northwestern germany , has clinched a deal with somali opposition politician galadod abdinur ahmad darman , who wants to topple the internationally-recognized transitional federal government -lrb- tfg -rrb- in somalia . security experts warn that a somali warlord backed by highly-trained western soldiers could shift the fragile political balance in the east african country and spark a bloodbath .
german interests compromised " if a german company now trains and supports a somali warring faction then it is surely against the interests of the german government , " annette weber , from the german institute for international and security affairs , told ndr .
several german lawmakers have criticized asgaard 's proposed military involvement in africa .
" the contract includes wide-ranging tasks and areas of competence : from strategic planning to security to implementation of all measures that are necessary to restore peace and stability , " said asgaard in a press release .
the company also provides police and military training and logistics .
thomas kaltegaertner , asgaard managing director and a former master sergeant in the bundeswehr , told ndr that the somalia project involved providing armed protection for military , buildings and convoys in the high-risk country .
in a statement , asgaard said it would not act against the interests of the federal republic of germany and would never get into a conflict situation with german armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of people have already been killed in the somali civil war this year " if worst comes to worst , that a patrol or convoy is attacked , the team will take appropriate action " , said kaltegaertner .
ninety-nine percent of the personnel are recruited from germany , he said .
the first contingent is reportedly already on its way to somalia .
the asgaard deployment would potentially put the german ex-soldiers in direct conflict with the tfg 's only protective force , the african union mission to somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- , backed by the united nations .
at a conference in brussels a year ago , the international community pledged $ 213 million -lrb- 172 million euros -rrb- to the besieged tfg and amisom .
eu mission the deal between asgaard and darman , a member of the powerful hawiyes clan in somalia , is especially explosive because the european union has been training somali security forces of the interim government in uganda .
thirteen bundeswehr soldiers are also participating in the european union training mission -lrb- eutm -rrb- in somalia .
darman told ndr that the german mercenaries would be involved in military combat with his militia against pirates , radical islamists and terrorists .
" the government installed by the international community does not have the backing from the country 's population " , said darman .
darman is currently seeking international support for his bid to become president of somalia .
no prior knowledge the german foreign ministry acknowledged that it knew nothing about the contract and the activities of asgaard germany security group .
the defense ministry also confirmed that it has never entered into any contractual agreement with the company .
rainer stinne , a fdp foreign policy expert , said asgaard should be made accountable because the contract violated un sanctions. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.05.2010 traditional rome changes course with first modern art museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building makes use of one of rome 's most famous inventions : cement rome is stepping outside its ancient walls into art 's future .
the maxxi , the country 's first national museum dedicated to contemporary art , opens at the end of may .
it was designed by star iraqi architect zaha hadid . italian art and architectural innovation often seem more stuck in the past than the columns that hold up the 2,000 year old colosseum .
however , the maxxi - a play on the words " museum of art " and the roman numerals for the 21st century - is a newcomer that may just conquer italy 's obsession with the past . italy may represent the pinnacle in art and architecture , yet time seems to have stopped there when michelangelo 's david picked up that sling . modern artists and architects have taken a whipping .
the buildings and boulevards built during the fascist era in the 1920 's and 1930 's were dramatic , yet despised .
more recently , american architect richard meier 's ara pacis museum , which encases an ancient altar , has suffered tongue lashings from italians who 've nicknamed it the " gas station . " while italy 's neighbors have embraced modern art and architecture , italy has been left in a cloud of its own renaissance-era dust .
yet in 1998 , italy 's culture ministry decided to shake things up , launching the maxxi project . " the idea was to ensure that italy would also have modern art , that it was n't always looking back to the art of the past , " said pio baldi , the president of the foundation that operates maxxi . the former cultural director said italy offers countless examples of artistic ingenuity from rome 's colosseum and trajan 's column to giotto 's frescos in padua 's scrovegni chapel .
yet he and his ministry colleagues began to " wonder what 400 years from now will be considered the country 's cultural heritage . " " it is n't as if italian creativity has dried up , " baldi added . bildunterschrift : hadid aimed to create a fluid space ' art does n't stop ' however , the national art budget had dwindled in the years since popes supported michelangelo , bernini and the other hotshot artists of bygone eras .
italy is home to 70 percent of the world 's art , but funding is stretched thin and contemporary art acquisitions have not been a priority . " there 's no doubt that we began focusing on modern art late , " said anna mattirolo , maxxi 's art curator .
" there were some difficult years . " in the dozen years following the museum 's approval , funding ebbed and flowed under three different mayors and the government turned over six times .
italy 's legendary bureaucracy slowed construction and the plans had to be overhauled when rome was declared a seismic area .
yet maxxi has survived all the tremors . " it 's very important , " said mattirolo , " because culture does n't stop .
art moves on , gets recognized and conserved and takes us into the future . " a renaissance of modern art the romans - who , in ancient times , revolutionized the use of concrete and created classical aqueducts - knew that they 'd have to make a splash with maxxi . " rome 's arrived last on the international modern art scene , " mattirolo said . " it would 've been a lost chance if this museum was n't distinctly original . " to that end , the country of old masters selected a contemporary one to build the museum .
zaha hadid , the iraqi-born and london-based architect , was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker architecture prize .
one of her earliest and most notable works was the fire station at the vitra furniture headquarters in weil am rhein , germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zaha hadid was the first woman to win the prestigious pritzker prize for maxxi , hadid wanted to create a structure that was more than a container for art . she envisioned an " urban cultural center . "
the 150-million-euro -lrb- $ 150-million -rrb- project is located a tram ride away from rome 's historic center with its ancient ruins , cobblestone streets and countless baroque churches .
built on the grounds of a former military barracks , the museum sits among residential homes from the early 20th century . rocking ' n ' rolling in rome the stark , white museum constructed with the famous roman concrete looks like a series of boxes stacked on top of each other .
the walls curve and a part juts over the piazza below , an effect also used in the hadid 's design for the bmw factory in leipzig , germany . the maxxi 's sleek modern exterior manages to reflect elements of the eternal city .
rome is n't just one city , but many built on top of each other spanning the epochs from etruscan to roman to medieval and beyond . " the project emerges in its early phase of as many layers resting on each other , " hadid said in 2008 .
" the idea is to make a layered space or a layered city almost at once , as if learning from history and how the layering worked . " inside , maxxi flows like the nearby tiber river .
steel black stairways bend in cavernous white spaces .
natural light streams from the glass ceiling , taking advantage of rome 's perennial sunshine .
there are 29,000 square meters -lrb- 312,000 square feet -rrb- of gallery space - indoors and outdoors .
hadid does n't think a roof overhead was mandatory .
for her art " campus , " she foresees exhibits in the surrounding piazza and projections on the massive walls . " it really is symbolic of a beginning , i think , in terms of our work of how to be able to create fluid space , " said 59-year-old hadid during a sneak preview of the building in november 2009 . bildunterschrift : the building resembles a layered city designing outside the box walls that curve and unwind to become floors would make some art curators wish for a return to the traditional . " this space is a challenge , " curator mattirolo admitted .
" above all , because it 's a new space . there 's no space quite like it . " ” room partitions can be hung from the roof beams , carving out smaller spaces , and art can also be suspended from the ceiling . " it 's an adventure that we have just started that 's intense , no doubt , " added mattirolo .
" but i believe that i can say it 's also completely positive . " on may 30 , the museum will open with exhibits that highlight the revolutionary building and give a preview of the museum 's own collection .
since 2000 , the museum has built up a relatively small collection of 300 pieces .
a retrospective of the works of fascist-era architect luigi moretti will also be displayed .
another exhibit will highlight the late , provocative italian artist gino de dominicis , who often worked with skeletons . rome ready for something new for most visitors , the maxxi complex itself will be the attraction . the preview of maxxi in late 2009 reassured the art community that romans probably would n't lay siege to this newest landmark .
" they were very , very pleased , " pio baldi said .
" in fact , i was very much struck by the fact that people were walking around here smiling . " hadid has said that she wants to create architecture that makes people feel comfortable - not a bad strategy in italy , where few architects would want the masses to turn against them .
the city of rome has recently decided to tear down a wall of richard meier 's reviled ara pacis museum .
a few years ago , vandals doused the building with red and green paint and left a toilet and toilet paper at the base .
after 12 years , hadid is satisfied with maxxi .
she realizes , however , that her avant-garde building may take some getting used to for italians . " i hope i 'll come back regularly to visit to make sure they have not done anything odd , " said hadid with a warning .

some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .
" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 23.05.2010 loose tweets sink fleets : soldiering in the internet era 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as more troops communicate with tools like twitter , military leaders seek to educate them military commanders are coming to terms with the fact that most of their troops use social networking sites like facebook .
some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .

some are adopting policies attempting to stave off inadvertent security breaches . secrecy has been a central tenet of warfare since sun tzu wrote " the art of war " in the sixth century : " o divine art of subtlety and secrecy !
through you we learn to be invisible , through you inaudible ; and hence we can hold the enemy 's fate in our hands . "
in the world wide web 's short history as a conduit and vessel of knowledge , its ability to keep secrets has not been among its strongest qualities .
indeed , the whistle-blowing website wikileaks has famously been hailed for creating more news scoops than the washington post has in the past 30 years .
but beyond the efforts of those seeking to uncover secrets , military forces have also had to contend with the unwitting efforts of their own members inadvertently giving away classified information online .
status update regret the israeli defense force -lrb- idf -rrb- was recently forced to scrap a mission after a soldier posted details about it on his facebook page , the jerusalem post reported in march .
the soldier was jailed for 10 days and kicked out of his unit , while the israeli military kicked off a major education and oversight effort .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the israeli defense force had to crack down after sensitive data ended up on the web the idf created a new intelligence unit to monitor the troops ' facebook , myspace and twitter activity , and also ordered some officers to undergo polygraph tests to ensure they were n't leaking information to the press , according to israeli newspaper haaretz .
in spite of , or perhaps because of , security risks such as these , other military forces are abandoning their earlier draconian responses to social networking websites , in favor of more educational techniques .
social anxiety the us military has long been making noise and movements towards a more open internet presence .
department of defense -lrb- dod -rrb- services have had flickr , youtube and facebook accounts for years , having discovered the value of running public affairs campaigns and recruitment through these growing online communities . throughout 2009 the dod released statements about an upcoming social media hub and its public affairs teams published guidelines for social media use .
but for the troops , access to websites such as facebook , twitter or blogs from their work computers was blocked .
one instruction from the united states air force , afi35-101 , lays down the law for the troops : " specifically , each air force member or employee is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance … before releasing any proposed statement , text or imagery to the public .
this includes any digital products being loaded on an unrestricted website . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , us troops could n't access most social networking websites concern for damaging public perception brought about by troops making statements in the public sphere has been a sticking point for the military .
but in an era when mass publication and syndication is no longer expressly the domain of the media , commanders have had to realign their policies .
internet for everyone the dod released a memorandum in february directing bases to open their networks for access to social media and other web-based tools , such as blogs and email clients that had previously been blocked .
the public message is that the new openness is for the benefit of the personnel .
" the air force views the use of social media sites as a positive way to communicate and conduct business , " general c. robert kehler , commander in the air force space command , said on the official usaf website . " providing more open access will allow the air force to communicate more effectively to all air force personnel , their families and external audiences . "
professor erin sahlstein at the university of nevada , las vegas , agrees that the access to social media helps military families .
" service members can stay in touch more frequently with their family and friends , which helps maintain their relationships with folks back home and gives them a connection to normal life , " sahlstein said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 23.05.2010 loose tweets sink fleets : soldiering in the internet era back to first page back 2/2 lingering skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some soldiers are questioning the wisdom of allowing access to sites like facebook from work among the ranks , however , the reaction to the new access has been mixed .
" so long , productivity !
hooray facebook and hotmail ! " wrote one air force member from his work computer shortly after the system was opened up at the beginning of may .
" i am literally at work , next to classified material posting this - what a great move air force ! ! " was another airman 's reaction on facebook .
but some saw it more positively .
" i am too busy to surf -lsb- social media sites -rsb- too much .
i am sure marines are online all day .
at times , it 's the only way to communicate when military means are down , " one us marine admitted .
enjoy yourself in the uk , the ministry of defense took a proactive approach to social media for the troops last summer .
its online engagement guidelines and other policies encourage troops to interact online .
along with reminders to " maintain security " and " think about reputation " the ministry of defense delivers a friendlier message , " enjoy yourself - you have a great story to tell , and are the best person to tell it . "
british soldiers are even being asked to create social media presences as part of their official duties , in order to explain their work to the public , the ministry 's website said .
" it 's about training and educating and advising our people - just like you do n't talk about certain things down the pub , likewise you should n't talk about certain things online , " robin riley , the head of online engagement , was quoted as saying .
hands off approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers can not access social media sites except from deployed locations in germany , there have been few similar revelations regarding social networking websites .
the bundeswehr has never dictated the proper use of online platforms .
" we have no written policy like the us and the british have , " spokesman commander klaus tautges told deutsche welle .
instead , the soldiers of the bundeswehr are bound by the overarching soldatengesetz , the statute dictating the rights and responsibilities of the german military members .
" soldiers are legally obligated to have discretion when speaking about duty-related issues and to maintain the reputation of the bundeswehr in public , " tautges said .
with only a few exceptions , the german military has managed not to abuse the trust placed in it by its leaders .
access to social media websites is not usually allowed on duty computers , except in morale and welfare centers in deployed locations .
" we try to educate but not to regulate , so they can use these networks carefully and with respect , " tautges said .
teach a man to tweet education seems to be the compromise that most military forces are embracing , backed up by laws such as the soldatengesetz in germany and the uniform code of military justice in the us .
a pamphlet published by the us air force provides a list of tips for airmen using social media : do n't give away classified information .
do n't lie : credibility is critical , without it no one cares what you have to say .
use common sense - if you would n't say it front of your mother , do n't say it online .
the most important lesson to many soldiers , however , is the final tip : the enemy is engaged in this battle space , you must engage there as well .

" they get to hear about and share trivial information of their everyday lives as well as unpredictable events that may require social support . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.05.2010 watched by the west , ethiopia holds crucial election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the ruling eprdf party at a campaign rally in the capital addis ababa ethiopians vote sunday in the first election since a disputed 2005 poll ended in violence and strained the african nation 's relations with the west .
ludger schadomsky , head of dw 's ethiopian service , gauges the mood . the oversized campaign image of a yellow clock on the edge of addis ababa 's central meskel square looks a bit forlorn .
perhaps the party strategists of the ruling ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- should have erected the cut-out , which shows the clock 's dial as a beehive with a queen bee in the center , near the video screens where the residents of the capital addis ababa usually watch soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling eprdf is hoping to show voters it 's as hard-working as their bee emblem the bee is the party symbol of the eprdf .
led by prime minister meles zenawi , the party 's been in power since 1991 . the bee is considered an indefatigable worker that labors away in a group .
and that 's exactly the message the four-party eprdf coalition hopes to get out to the electorate : " look , we 're working day and night for the development of ethiopia . "
the fact that bee colonies are strictly hierarchical and that the queen alone has the say is probably also implied in the message .
but not everyone thinks the electoral gimmick works .
" they should have instead erected a functioning clock for us , " one ethiopian commentator wrote .
struggling to regain credibility but what 's more surprising is that the eprdf 's clock image shows the time as 10:10 .
that 's despite the fact that everybody , including members of the ruling party , know that it 's closing in on zero hour for ethiopia .
ever since a disputed election in 2005 ended in violence - 200 people were killed in street riots and opposition leaders and journalists were jailed - the country located on the horn of africa has lost a good deal of credibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a darling of the west , ethiopian prime minister meles is under fire for repressive measures prime minister meles has enjoyed attention on the international stage as africa 's climate negotiator .
but at home , his government has pushed through repressive laws targeting non-governmental organizations , journalists and civil society .
that has even prompted the us , one of ethiopia 's strongest allies , to criticize the crackdown .
in a country report in march , human rights watch was scathing about the eprdf 's record .
" the ruling party and the state have become one and the government is using its entire power to wipe out the opposition and to intimidate people so that they keep silent , " it said .
parties go all out to woo voters the arrest of opposition parliamentarians this week , and a ban on diplomats accredited in addis ababa to observe the elections on sunday , has further tarnished the image of the ruling party .
but the motives behind those decisions are a mystery .
nobody , not even the opposition , doubts that the eprdf will emerge as the biggest winner of the election .
the party has vowed that there will be no repeat of 2005 when even the omnipresent secret service did n't anticipate the voter swing to the opposition camp .
on wednesday , hundreds of eprdf supporters gathered in front of the parliamentary building for a final election rally .
the location was symbolic .
this is where the eprdf hopes to gain an absolute majority of the 547 seats in parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young eprdf supporters at a bicycle rally the event with buses and trucks , a bicycle rally by youth and heaps of yellow eprdf souvenirs demonstrated the clout of the ruling power whose election campaign has been boosted with one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- provided by private donors .
the 2010 election campaign has been marked by an unprecedented attempt by the parties to reach out to the electorate .
the 79 registered parties have been wooing voters through posters and banners , tv and radio campaign spots , via mobile phone text messaging as well as the old-fashioned megaphone .
it 's been made possible after ethiopia for the first time earmarked a central budget for political campaigning .
opposition too weak ?
but the eprdf 's unchallenged position is also based on the fact that ethiopia 's political opposition parties have huge weaknesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negaso gidada said the opposition has been harassed and intimidated they are often involved in internal squabbling and have made hollow electoral pledges .
even the promising eight-party opposition coalition medrek or the forum for democracy and dialog seems mostly united by the desire to see prime minister meles out of office .
negaso gidada , the deputy chairman of medrek and a former ethiopian president , said his coalition has n't had it easy .
" since 2005 , we 've been thrown in prison and harassed .
we 've been unable to open offices in many regions of the country , " gidada , who studied for his doctorate in germany and is a former ally of meles , said .
" from our point of view , these elections can not be fair . "
eu faces tricky monitoring task whether the elections are indeed free and fair is a task for the european union election observer mission eu-eom .
in 2005 , the team 's chief observer , portuguese ana gomes , fell out with the government after publishing a damning election report .
that prompted ethiopia 's western donors to shun their once favorite african ally and freeze the flow of funds to addis ababa .
relations between addis ababa and brussels too have been frosty ever since .
nevertheless , the eu is back this time with a 190-member team to observe the election in a few of the 43,500 polling stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thijs berman heads the eu election observation team in ethiopia " of course the shadow of 2005 is hanging over us , " thijs berman , head of the eu monitoring team , said .
" for one , ethiopians do n't want any violence .
and secondly , i 'm confronted with a government that 's extremely skeptical of our mission . "
but all eyes will be on berman once polling ends on sunday .
that 's because the american carter center will not be observing the elections this time after it massively criticized irregularities during the 2005 polls .
and nobody expects the africa union to issue a negative statement on the polls either .
berman , who led the eu observer mission in afghanistan last year , has a degree in psychology .
he 'll probably need it to analyze and assess election proceedings in a country that lived in a medieval feudal society until less than 50 years ago and that has never experienced a peaceful transition of power in its recent history .
hopes for a peaceful poll but the bee , even when it 's hounded , is usually a peaceful creature .
the symbols of the big opposition parties are also relatively tame - a conciliatory handshake , a " thumbs-up " sign or a flower .
but there are some parties who have darker emblems - a shield and a spear , a blazing torch or a lurking tiger .
despite that , some 80 million ethiopians and many election observers are hoping that after the bloody post-poll riots in 2005 , the country will this time take a peaceful route .
the opposition parties have called on their supporters to keep calm but they 've warned that they will not be able to " prevent spontaneous protests " in case of election fraud .
the televised election debates this time have been relatively conciliatory even though they 've been thin on substance and political content .
most of the parties have also signed up to an election code drafted by sweden .
mohammed abdurahman , spokesman of the ethiopian election commission nebe , said that even six allegedly politically-motivated deaths in the last four weeks will not disrupt peaceful elections .
" individual political players may have behaved irresponsibly .
but the opinion of the ethiopian people is unambiguous : ' we do n't want any violence this time , " ' said abdurahman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 32 million ethiopians are registered to vote this time all eyes on first-time voters but it remains to be seen whether the message reaches first-time voters in the country .
the generation that was born when the eprdf came to power in 1991 is casting their ballots for the first time - that is if they bother at all .
a week before the elections , most first-time voters are much more interested in the soccer champions league final between bayern munich and inter milan than in the election .
a reader 's letter in an ethiopian daily recently complained about the " political apathy " of the " ipod generation . "
in reply , a young voter said he was ready to vote but only for the party that promised to broadcast live and free all soccer premier league games .
" we 've seen what happened five years ago , " 24-year-old salomon wrote .
he described himself as a soccer fan who has taken to wearing the cameroon national jersey because he says the ethiopian team is n't worth talking about .
" since then , i 've kept away from politics , " he wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.05.2010 german government proposes benefit cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to make big cuts to reduce its deficit while germany 's social welfare system is one of its proudest features , it is also one of its most expensive .
under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier germany fell to sweden in sunday 's bronze medal match in a hard-fought play-off match . the czech republic won the world ice hockey championship in cologne , germany , beating defending champions russia 2-1 in sunday 's final . undefeated since 2007 , russia had been looking for their third successive championship title .
but it was the czechs who got off to a flying start , scoring just 20 seconds into the match through klepis , who fired on an unguarded post . the russian side piled on the pressure but the czech defense remained tight .
a goal for russia was disallowed at the end of the first period . in the second period the czech republic scored a second goal when karel rachunek passed to tomas rolinek in the russian zone to clinch the winner a minute before the end of the second period . russia struck back in the final period , netting a power play goal with just 36 seconds remaining on the clock , but it was not enough to deny the czechs the deserved world title . " we 're obviously upset , " said russian skipper ilya kovalchuk , who was the competition 's top points scorer with 12 from two goals and 10 assists .
" we ca n't accept any other place than first .
we 're deeply disappointed . " bildunterschrift : germany 's team battled hard , but sweden retained the edge germany take fourth place earlier germany missed out on the chance to clinch a bronze medal at the world ice hockey championship in cologne on sunday , succumbing to a 3-1 defeat by sweden .
despite german efforts to level the scores , sweden remained in control throughout the game .
swedish striker magnus paajarvi svensson netted his fifth goal of the tournament , putting the puck past german goalkeeper dinnis endras some three minutes into the match .
for germany , playing in front of a 15,900 crowd at cologne 's lanxess arena , it was a chance to win the country 's first championship medal in more than 50 years .
the swedes remained dominant into the second period but it was german forward alexander bartas who was next to score , firing in a rebound under the crossbar to equalize .
however , sweden moved into the lead once again as jonas andersson beat endras with a sharp-angled shot between the pads .
gamble fails to pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite outward appearances , coach krupp was pleased with his team 's effort german coach uwe krupp substituted endras for a sixth field player with one minute remaining in a bid to equalize once again .
the gamble failed and andersson fired his sixth goal of the tournament into an empty net .
krupp said he would take some time to think about a possible contract extension as coach of the german team .
he also praised his players .
" the strength that we needed was no longer there .
one goal is not enough to win , but the team has played superbly in the tournament , " he said. nrt / rc / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian prime minster vladimir putin told broadcaster mir tv in an interview saturday that the agreement " can not come into full force , " but that he still hoped to speed up negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he would try to accelerate negotiations this year the customs union , in which the three former soviet states would adopt a common external tariff and redistribute the revenue it would bring in , was meant to be a first step in a process to create a free trade agreement and single economic space like the european union by 2012 .
according to a transcript of the putin interview published on a russian government website , putin said he had proposed " to accelerate solving the problems linked to a creation of a single economic space , " and that he would push to complete the necessary documents by the end of this year .
culprits : energy and automobiles putin cited the auto industry and customs tariffs as two " sensitive issues " for the three countries ' economies that have stymied progress .
analysts also say minsk has made the abolition of duties on russian oil exported to belarus a central condition for joining the union - something russia has refused to do .
" we need additional consultations and for experts to agree on ways to bring our positions closer , " said belarus prime minister sergei sidorsky .
" so far this has not happened . "
a formal customs union between russia and belarus already exists , and the new bloc would incorporate energy-rich kazakhstan , which is central asia 's largest economy .
last year , kazakhstan 's neighbors and fellow ex-soviet states tajikistan and kyrgyzstan also expressed interest in joining the union. acb / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so long , productivity !
hooray facebook and hotmail ! " wrote one air force member from his work computer shortly after the system was opened up at the beginning of may .
" i am literally at work , next to classified material posting this - what a great move air force ! ! " was another airman 's reaction on facebook .
but some saw it more positively .
" i am too busy to surf -lsb- social media sites -rsb- too much .
i am sure marines are online all day .
at times , it 's the only way to communicate when military means are down , " one us marine admitted .
enjoy yourself in the uk , the ministry of defense took a proactive approach to social media for the troops last summer .
its online engagement guidelines and other policies encourage troops to interact online .
along with reminders to " maintain security " and " think about reputation " the ministry of defense delivers a friendlier message , " enjoy yourself - you have a great story to tell , and are the best person to tell it . "
british soldiers are even being asked to create social media presences as part of their official duties , in order to explain their work to the public , the ministry 's website said .
" it 's about training and educating and advising our people - just like you do n't talk about certain things down the pub , likewise you should n't talk about certain things online , " robin riley , the head of online engagement , was quoted as saying .
hands off approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers can not access social media sites except from deployed locations in germany , there have been few similar revelations regarding social networking websites .
the bundeswehr has never dictated the proper use of online platforms .
" we have no written policy like the us and the british have , " spokesman commander klaus tautges told deutsche welle .
instead , the soldiers of the bundeswehr are bound by the overarching soldatengesetz , the statute dictating the rights and responsibilities of the german military members .
" soldiers are legally obligated to have discretion when speaking about duty-related issues and to maintain the reputation of the bundeswehr in public , " tautges said .
with only a few exceptions , the german military has managed not to abuse the trust placed in it by its leaders .
access to social media websites is not usually allowed on duty computers , except in morale and welfare centers in deployed locations .
" we try to educate but not to regulate , so they can use these networks carefully and with respect , " tautges said .
teach a man to tweet education seems to be the compromise that most military forces are embracing , backed up by laws such as the soldatengesetz in germany and the uniform code of military justice in the us .
a pamphlet published by the us air force provides a list of tips for airmen using social media : do n't give away classified information .
do n't lie : credibility is critical , without it no one cares what you have to say .
use common sense - if you would n't say it front of your mother , do n't say it online .
the most important lesson to many soldiers , however , is the final tip : the enemy is engaged in this battle space , you must engage there as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.05.2010 crucial state coalition talks remain an uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft prefers an spd-fdp-green coalition more than two weeks after inconclusive state elections in north rhine-westphalia , the semi-victorious social democrats are still struggling to find a coalition partner and break center-right control in berlin . the return of a " grand coalition " of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- took a step forward in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the five parties elected to state parliament are weighing their options in forming a government .
hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the coming months will be crucial , " said westerwelle .
" we ask the parties to move from proximity talks to direct negotiations as a sole path that leads to the two-state solution and stability in the middle east . "
westerwelle said germany remained committed to " close coordination " with the us middle east envoy george mitchell , who is conducting the proximity talks .

westerwelle ruled out a loan of the bust to egypt saying it was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle said that there was no reason that a dispute over the ownership of the bust should drive a wedge between the countries. rc / afp / dpa / ap editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.05.2010 crucial state coalition talks remain an uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft prefers an spd-fdp-green coalition more than two weeks after inconclusive state elections in north rhine-westphalia , the semi-victorious social democrats are still struggling to find a coalition partner and break center-right control in berlin . the return of a " grand coalition " of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- took a step forward in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the five parties elected to state parliament are weighing their options in forming a government .
hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the coming months will be crucial , " said westerwelle .
" we ask the parties to move from proximity talks to direct negotiations as a sole path that leads to the two-state solution and stability in the middle east . "
westerwelle said germany remained committed to " close coordination " with the us middle east envoy george mitchell , who is conducting the proximity talks .

he said the country was indispensable for achieving a " constructive solution " in the region .
" whoever wishes to support the peace process in the middle east must also seek talks with syria , " westerwelle said after meeting syrian president bashar al-assad .
following earlier meetings in egypt with egyptian president hosni mubarak , westerwelle stressed the importance of " goodwill " on the part of all parties with a role to play in paving the way for peace .

german officials say the 3,400-year-old bust , displayed in berlin 's new museum , was legally purchased by prussia in 1913 .
westerwelle ruled out a loan of the bust to egypt saying it was too delicate to be moved and that it was in the interest of world culture for it to remain safe in berlin .
westerwelle said that there was no reason that a dispute over the ownership of the bust should drive a wedge between the countries. rc / afp / dpa / ap editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian prime minster vladimir putin told broadcaster mir tv in an interview saturday that the agreement " can not come into full force , " but that he still hoped to speed up negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he would try to accelerate negotiations this year the customs union , in which the three former soviet states would adopt a common external tariff and redistribute the revenue it would bring in , was meant to be a first step in a process to create a free trade agreement and single economic space like the european union by 2012 .
according to a transcript of the putin interview published on a russian government website , putin said he had proposed " to accelerate solving the problems linked to a creation of a single economic space , " and that he would push to complete the necessary documents by the end of this year .
culprits : energy and automobiles putin cited the auto industry and customs tariffs as two " sensitive issues " for the three countries ' economies that have stymied progress .
analysts also say minsk has made the abolition of duties on russian oil exported to belarus a central condition for joining the union - something russia has refused to do .
" we need additional consultations and for experts to agree on ways to bring our positions closer , " said belarus prime minister sergei sidorsky .
" so far this has not happened . "
a formal customs union between russia and belarus already exists , and the new bloc would incorporate energy-rich kazakhstan , which is central asia 's largest economy .
last year , kazakhstan 's neighbors and fellow ex-soviet states tajikistan and kyrgyzstan also expressed interest in joining the union. acb / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .

hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .

the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .

but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .

but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 23.05.2010 german government proposes benefit cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to make big cuts to reduce its deficit while germany 's social welfare system is one of its proudest features , it is also one of its most expensive .
under pressure to trim budget deficits , the conservative government is looking to roll back benefits . german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble has riled opposition parties after suggesting in a newspaper interview that unemployment benefits should be cut to save the state money .
" we must organize our social security system so that it motivates regular employment , and does n't create incentives to the contrary , " schaeuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung weekend newspaper .
" that could even lead to savings in our budget . "
in order to reign in germany 's large budget deficit , the finance minister is under pressure to make dramatic cuts in the 2011 budget .
these cuts could be finalized in a coalition convention on june 6 and 7 , he said , and they would be done with transparency and without " budget tricks . "
" i have not pulled tricks so far , and i will not pull tricks in the future , " he said .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , told newspaper bild am sonntag that funding for retirement benefits and the controversial hartz-iv unemployment program should also be reduced .
he added that only education , research and development should be immune to budget cuts .
" in order to clean up our state finances , everyone must share the load in solidarity , " keitel said .
bildunterschrift : schaeuble and merkel have both made trimming the budget deficit a high priority taxes as an alternative opposition and union leaders were quick to condemn schaeuble 's statements , with social democrat leader sigmar gabriel accusing chancellor angela merkel 's government of being out of touch with the country .
" at a time when we have many people who can enter the workforce only when they are better qualified , making savings here is not particularly smart , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday .
meanwhile the union sozialverband vdk said keitel 's suggestion " falls completely short . "
" there are no population groups who have suffered greater losses of income than pensioners and the unemployed , " said the organization 's president ulrike mascher .
klaus zimmermann , president of the german institute for economic research , told the regional passauer neuen presse that savings should go hand-in-hand with tax increases .
zimmermann named some primary targets : the tax-free status of bonuses paid to people who work sundays , holidays and nights , tax deductions given to job commuters and subsidies paid to employers who shorten work hours in exchange for not cutting jobs - something zimmermann called " no longer necessary . "
" these add up to a total of 40 billion euros , " the economist said. acb / dpa / apn editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian prime minster vladimir putin told broadcaster mir tv in an interview saturday that the agreement " can not come into full force , " but that he still hoped to speed up negotiations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he would try to accelerate negotiations this year the customs union , in which the three former soviet states would adopt a common external tariff and redistribute the revenue it would bring in , was meant to be a first step in a process to create a free trade agreement and single economic space like the european union by 2012 .
according to a transcript of the putin interview published on a russian government website , putin said he had proposed " to accelerate solving the problems linked to a creation of a single economic space , " and that he would push to complete the necessary documents by the end of this year .
culprits : energy and automobiles putin cited the auto industry and customs tariffs as two " sensitive issues " for the three countries ' economies that have stymied progress .
analysts also say minsk has made the abolition of duties on russian oil exported to belarus a central condition for joining the union - something russia has refused to do .
" we need additional consultations and for experts to agree on ways to bring our positions closer , " said belarus prime minister sergei sidorsky .
" so far this has not happened . "
a formal customs union between russia and belarus already exists , and the new bloc would incorporate energy-rich kazakhstan , which is central asia 's largest economy .
last year , kazakhstan 's neighbors and fellow ex-soviet states tajikistan and kyrgyzstan also expressed interest in joining the union. acb / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 23.05.2010 crucial state coalition talks remain an uphill battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft prefers an spd-fdp-green coalition more than two weeks after inconclusive state elections in north rhine-westphalia , the semi-victorious social democrats are still struggling to find a coalition partner and break center-right control in berlin . the return of a " grand coalition " of the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- took a step forward in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , where the five parties elected to state parliament are weighing their options in forming a government .
hannelore kraft , the social democrats ' candidate for state premier , has taken up the challenge of forming a new government , after the failure of her preferred option - an alliance with the green party - failed to win a majority .
after talks with the socialist left party broke down , kraft said she hopes the business-minded free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- will reconsider their refusal to join a coalition with the spd and greens .
" we offered to have discussions with the fdp , " she told newspaper bild am sonntag .
" yet the fdp has avoided their democratic responsibility . "
also possible is the return of the so-called " grand coalition " between spd and cdu , which ruled the federal government from 2005 until last year 's federal elections .
but since the cdu won a marginally larger share of the vote in nrw , this alliance would damage kraft 's hopes of becoming state premier .
this in turn would ruin the spd 's hopes of winning control of the upper house of the german parliament , the bundesrat , from the cdu-fdp federal government .
" we will conduct discussions -lsb- with the cdu -rsb- with absolute sincerity , " kraft said .
" but it remains to be seen if we will ultimately agree on building a coalition government . "
bildunterschrift : kraft , left , may be forced to cede the state premiership to incumbent juergen ruettgers because the spd and cdu received an equal number of seats in the state parliament , it may also be possible that incumbent state premier juergen ruettgers could retain his position in a grand coalition .
the north rhine-westphalia election , on may 9 , was the first litmus test for chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp federal government .
if the spd is able to form a new coalition government in the state , it would rob merkel 's coalition of its control of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
few options talks that began after the election among the spd , greens and the left party quickly collapsed due to the left 's extremist positions .
if all coalition talks fail , there is the possibility of new elections being called in the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd-green coalition talks with the left party collapsed in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk on sunday , social democrat party head sigmar gabriel said he would not rule out a coalition with the cdu under ruettgers , although he declined to list the party 's conditions before talks began .
but despite it being a difficult goal , he said he still favors a coalition with the greens and fdp .
" that from my point of view would still be the best solution , if the fdp would be more sensible , " he said .
meanwhile , guntram schneider , the head of the north rhine-westphalia labor union federation , said a grand coalition with the cdu was still conceivable , even under a cdu state premier , as long as it was not ruettgers .
the important thing , schneider said , was a stable government .
but from the point-of-view of the cdu and spd , the most important thing is securing a majority in the bundesrat .
if the spd can form a government in north rhine-westphalia without the cdu , it would break the conservative grip on the upper house , and seriously hinder chancellor merkel 's legislative plans. acb / gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to german tv , more than a 100 former bundeswehr soldiers will fight as mercenaries in somalia . former bundeswehr soldiers are to fight as mercenaries in the civil war in somalia , according to german public tv station ndr .
asgaard german security group , a company based in telgte near muenster in northwestern germany , has clinched a deal with somali opposition politician galadod abdinur ahmad darman , who wants to topple the internationally-recognized transitional federal government -lrb- tfg -rrb- in somalia . security experts warn that a somali warlord backed by highly-trained western soldiers could shift the fragile political balance in the east african country and spark a bloodbath .
german interests compromised " if a german company now trains and supports a somali warring faction then it is surely against the interests of the german government , " annette weber , from the german institute for international and security affairs , told ndr .
several german lawmakers have criticized asgaard 's proposed military involvement in africa .
" the contract includes wide-ranging tasks and areas of competence : from strategic planning to security to implementation of all measures that are necessary to restore peace and stability , " said asgaard in a press release .
the company also provides police and military training and logistics .
thomas kaltegaertner , asgaard managing director and a former master sergeant in the bundeswehr , told ndr that the somalia project involved providing armed protection for military , buildings and convoys in the high-risk country .
in a statement , asgaard said it would not act against the interests of the federal republic of germany and would never get into a conflict situation with german armed forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scores of people have already been killed in the somali civil war this year " if worst comes to worst , that a patrol or convoy is attacked , the team will take appropriate action " , said kaltegaertner .
ninety-nine percent of the personnel are recruited from germany , he said .
the first contingent is reportedly already on its way to somalia .
the asgaard deployment would potentially put the german ex-soldiers in direct conflict with the tfg 's only protective force , the african union mission to somalia -lrb- amisom -rrb- , backed by the united nations .
at a conference in brussels a year ago , the international community pledged $ 213 million -lrb- 172 million euros -rrb- to the besieged tfg and amisom .
eu mission the deal between asgaard and darman , a member of the powerful hawiyes clan in somalia , is especially explosive because the european union has been training somali security forces of the interim government in uganda .
thirteen bundeswehr soldiers are also participating in the european union training mission -lrb- eutm -rrb- in somalia .
darman told ndr that the german mercenaries would be involved in military combat with his militia against pirates , radical islamists and terrorists .
" the government installed by the international community does not have the backing from the country 's population " , said darman .
darman is currently seeking international support for his bid to become president of somalia .
no prior knowledge the german foreign ministry acknowledged that it knew nothing about the contract and the activities of asgaard germany security group .
the defense ministry also confirmed that it has never entered into any contractual agreement with the company .
rainer stinne , a fdp foreign policy expert , said asgaard should be made accountable because the contract violated un sanctions. nrt / dpa / afp / reuters editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a transcript of the putin interview published on a russian government website , putin said he had proposed " to accelerate solving the problems linked to a creation of a single economic space , " and that he would push to complete the necessary documents by the end of this year .
culprits : energy and automobiles putin cited the auto industry and customs tariffs as two " sensitive issues " for the three countries ' economies that have stymied progress .
analysts also say minsk has made the abolition of duties on russian oil exported to belarus a central condition for joining the union - something russia has refused to do .
" we need additional consultations and for experts to agree on ways to bring our positions closer , " said belarus prime minister sergei sidorsky .
" so far this has not happened . "
a formal customs union between russia and belarus already exists , and the new bloc would incorporate energy-rich kazakhstan , which is central asia 's largest economy .
last year , kazakhstan 's neighbors and fellow ex-soviet states tajikistan and kyrgyzstan also expressed interest in joining the union. acb / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier germany fell to sweden in sunday 's bronze medal match in a hard-fought play-off match . the czech republic won the world ice hockey championship in cologne , germany , beating defending champions russia 2-1 in sunday 's final . undefeated since 2007 , russia had been looking for their third successive championship title .
but it was the czechs who got off to a flying start , scoring just 20 seconds into the match through klepis , who fired on an unguarded post . the russian side piled on the pressure but the czech defense remained tight .
a goal for russia was disallowed at the end of the first period . in the second period the czech republic scored a second goal when karel rachunek passed to tomas rolinek in the russian zone to clinch the winner a minute before the end of the second period . russia struck back in the final period , netting a power play goal with just 36 seconds remaining on the clock , but it was not enough to deny the czechs the deserved world title . " we 're obviously upset , " said russian skipper ilya kovalchuk , who was the competition 's top points scorer with 12 from two goals and 10 assists .
" we ca n't accept any other place than first .
we 're deeply disappointed . " bildunterschrift : germany 's team battled hard , but sweden retained the edge germany take fourth place earlier germany missed out on the chance to clinch a bronze medal at the world ice hockey championship in cologne on sunday , succumbing to a 3-1 defeat by sweden .
despite german efforts to level the scores , sweden remained in control throughout the game .
swedish striker magnus paajarvi svensson netted his fifth goal of the tournament , putting the puck past german goalkeeper dinnis endras some three minutes into the match .
for germany , playing in front of a 15,900 crowd at cologne 's lanxess arena , it was a chance to win the country 's first championship medal in more than 50 years .
the swedes remained dominant into the second period but it was german forward alexander bartas who was next to score , firing in a rebound under the crossbar to equalize .
however , sweden moved into the lead once again as jonas andersson beat endras with a sharp-angled shot between the pads .
gamble fails to pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite outward appearances , coach krupp was pleased with his team 's effort german coach uwe krupp substituted endras for a sixth field player with one minute remaining in a bid to equalize once again .
the gamble failed and andersson fired his sixth goal of the tournament into an empty net .
krupp said he would take some time to think about a possible contract extension as coach of the german team .
he also praised his players .

earlier germany fell to sweden in sunday 's bronze medal match in a hard-fought play-off match . the czech republic won the world ice hockey championship in cologne , germany , beating defending champions russia 2-1 in sunday 's final . undefeated since 2007 , russia had been looking for their third successive championship title .
but it was the czechs who got off to a flying start , scoring just 20 seconds into the match through klepis , who fired on an unguarded post . the russian side piled on the pressure but the czech defense remained tight .
a goal for russia was disallowed at the end of the first period . in the second period the czech republic scored a second goal when karel rachunek passed to tomas rolinek in the russian zone to clinch the winner a minute before the end of the second period . russia struck back in the final period , netting a power play goal with just 36 seconds remaining on the clock , but it was not enough to deny the czechs the deserved world title . " we 're obviously upset , " said russian skipper ilya kovalchuk , who was the competition 's top points scorer with 12 from two goals and 10 assists .
" we ca n't accept any other place than first .
we 're deeply disappointed . " bildunterschrift : germany 's team battled hard , but sweden retained the edge germany take fourth place earlier germany missed out on the chance to clinch a bronze medal at the world ice hockey championship in cologne on sunday , succumbing to a 3-1 defeat by sweden .
despite german efforts to level the scores , sweden remained in control throughout the game .
swedish striker magnus paajarvi svensson netted his fifth goal of the tournament , putting the puck past german goalkeeper dinnis endras some three minutes into the match .
for germany , playing in front of a 15,900 crowd at cologne 's lanxess arena , it was a chance to win the country 's first championship medal in more than 50 years .
the swedes remained dominant into the second period but it was german forward alexander bartas who was next to score , firing in a rebound under the crossbar to equalize .
however , sweden moved into the lead once again as jonas andersson beat endras with a sharp-angled shot between the pads .
gamble fails to pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite outward appearances , coach krupp was pleased with his team 's effort german coach uwe krupp substituted endras for a sixth field player with one minute remaining in a bid to equalize once again .
the gamble failed and andersson fired his sixth goal of the tournament into an empty net .
krupp said he would take some time to think about a possible contract extension as coach of the german team .
he also praised his players .
" the strength that we needed was no longer there .
