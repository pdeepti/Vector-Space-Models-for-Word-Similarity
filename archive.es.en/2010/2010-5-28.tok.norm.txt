but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 28.05.2010 can turkey save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is currently the fastest growing economy in europe with the european economy floundering , turkey - which underwent its own crisis in 2001 - has become a model of stability , boasting robust growth and a secure banking system .
now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "

the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .

the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .
the debt crisis in greece could even exacerbate lending conditions and thus jeopardize any signs of an upswing in the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.05.2010 dutch groups want to expand assisted suicide rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you no longer want to live , do you have an automatic right to die ?
assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 28.05.2010 cosmopolitan berliners prefer english , except in the theater großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a decade ago the sound of english in central berlin still had a slight scent of the exotic about it , these days its flat vowels can be heard on pretty much any street corner - but less so in cinemas and theaters . call it european , call it progress or call it money saved on a german phrasebook - it 's a contemporary berlin truth that you can get by on english .
whereas once upon a time buying salami or ordering coffee in anything but perfect -lrb- and suitably gruff sounding -rrb- german would have elicited horrified exclamations of " wie bitte ? " , bi-lingual employees have now become a feature of the city 's growing service industry .
and they are n't the only ones afraid to step outside the german language fold .
everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .
festival director frie leysen from belgium travelled across the globe to select this year 's artists .
there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 28.05.2010 jamming of dw is part of ethiopia 's campaign against press freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dw reporter interviews an election helper in ethiopia .
coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

" millatfacebook is pakistan 's very own first social networking site .
a site for muslims by muslims where sweet people of other religions are also welcome . " this is the statement that greets you when you go to millatfacebook.com.
the six young entrepreneurs who created the site say it is for muslims to interact online .
the urdu word " millat " means " nation " . the new site has already attracted over 4,300 members .
some of the members say they joined so that they could stay in touch with their friends when facebook was blocked .
others see the site as an alternative for muslims angered by the american site . " a service that does not hurt the sentiments of any religion " the founders of the site write on the page that they have set up their alternative site because of facebook 's refusal to take the complaints of muslims seriously . " the reason behind the launching of millatfacebook is very simple , " azhar siddique , an advocate and one of the site 's co-founders , told deutsche welle . " facebook was basically meant to disturb the thoughts of islam as well as certain other religions ; as far as millatfacebook is concerned , it is going to provide a service which wo n't hurt the sentiments of any religion .
it is open for all – it is only meant for social networking and there should be no direct or indirect hurt to anybody in any case whatsoever . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook.com founder mark zuckerberg at his office in palo alto - his site has over 400 million users worldwide blasphemous " prophet-drawing competition " earlier this month , a user of the popular american social networking site posted an initiative called " everybody draw mohammad day " – they called on members to draw the prophet in order to promote so-called " freedom of expression " .
the depiction of any prophet is considered blasphemous by islam and is prohibited . in response to the post , some muslim activists and students took to the streets of pakistan to protest .
facebook received hundreds of complaints . a court in lahore imposed a ban on the site , which the pakistan telecommunications authority then implemented .
it also blocked youtube for displaying what it considered " sacrilegious content " and restricted access to hundreds of other websites . facebook 's statistics state that the site has some 400 million users worldwide .
in pakistan , there are some 2.5 million users . goal to become biggest muslim social networking site therefore , with fewer than 5,000 members , millatfacebook has some way to go if it wants to catch up with the original facebook .
however , the goal is to become the biggest muslim social networking site in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry islamic activists protest against a page on facebook inviting members to draw prophet mohammad with members from countries as far flung as britain , russia and canada , the founders are satisfied that they are already on the way . but dr hasan askari rizvi , an international relations expert and facebook user , had his doubts : " i think the whole facebook issue has become more of an issue in pakistan .
there is less controversy in any other islamic countries and therefore this facebook may just be a pakistani enterprise .
it is not going to take off in the other countries . " " faith should be strong enough to counter blasphemy " however , even in pakistan , the site has its critics , who say that the online experience is far from adequate .
others , such as amara , an associate professor of english at punjab university , simply could not see the point in a new site . " if it succeeds in replacing the old facebook there will still maybe be the same issues .
if you make your own room dark and close your own eyes , how does that stop people from harming you ? " she asked . " our faith should be strong enough no matter how many facebooks there are , whether there are one or a million , our faith should be strong enough to be able to counter blasphemy against the prophet . " pakistan lifted the ban on youtube earlier this week .
facebook is expected to be banned until the end of the month .
the page that originally caused offense among muslims has disappeared from facebook.com. author : anne thomas editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the firm awaits the results as us president barack obama visits the area . oil giant bp puts its chances of blocking the seabed leak that has gushed oil into the gulf of mexico for the past three weeks at about 60 to 70 percent .
" we have wrestled it to the ground , but we have n't put a bullet in its head yet , " bp ceo tony hayward told news agency reuters while inspecting the spill site by helicopter .
hayward said the company would know if its " top kill " operation had worked within 48 hours , but that there were already some signs of success .
the process involves the injection of thousands of barrels of mud into the well to plug the leak , which has surpassed the 1989 exxon valdez disaster as the worst oil spill in us history .
obama visits coast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louisiana residents have pleaded for help from the us government hayward spoke as us president barack obama visited grand isle , louisiana , where he reiterated he would hold bp accountable for cleaning up the spill .
obama vowed that vigorous action would be taken to fight the spill and repeated his assertion that " buck stops with me . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 28.05.2010 jamming of dw is part of ethiopia 's campaign against press freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dw reporter interviews an election helper in ethiopia .
coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

whereas once upon a time buying salami or ordering coffee in anything but perfect -lrb- and suitably gruff sounding -rrb- german would have elicited horrified exclamations of " wie bitte ? " , bi-lingual employees have now become a feature of the city 's growing service industry .
and they are n't the only ones afraid to step outside the german language fold .
everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .
it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .
and who can blame them ?
imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .
and even if they did , there is a belief that germans - including those intent on sending their children to bi-lingual schools - would not come to watch .
because what they really want from english is to understand the lingo of international media , technology , fashion and business .
and that means they are quite content to listen to the bard , if they listen at all , in translation . so for the time being , the choice of original cinema and theater in berlin is likely to remain restricted .
but perhaps when all those infants currently taking lessons in baa baa black sheep have made it through school , they will inject a touch more linguistic variety onto the screens and stages of the german capital . tamsin walker enjoys film and theater in both english and german in berlin .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .
festival director frie leysen from belgium travelled across the globe to select this year 's artists .
there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .
there are no prizes at theater of the world , since the festival does n't seek to foster competition among participants .
instead , the focus is on the exchange and presentation of different perspectives .
also , performance spaces are n't limited to classical theater venues .
they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .
that may strike german soccer fans , who are likely to burst into a verse of a team anthem , as nothing unusual .
but on june 5 , the singing wo n't be about sports .
instead , gelsenkirchen 's stadium will house an enormous choir concert .
around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .
the concert marks the conclusion of a special musical weekend in the ruhr region . ! sing is the name of the project that serves as one of the high points of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
the goal is that singers will keep going from morning until night and fill the area with music .
at 12:10 on june 5 , church bells will pick up the tune of herbert groenemeyer 's " komm zur ruhr " -lrb- " come to the ruhr " -rrb- simultaneously in all of the ruhr region 's cities .

he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .
festival director frie leysen from belgium travelled across the globe to select this year 's artists .
there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .
there are no prizes at theater of the world , since the festival does n't seek to foster competition among participants .
instead , the focus is on the exchange and presentation of different perspectives .
also , performance spaces are n't limited to classical theater venues .
they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .
that may strike german soccer fans , who are likely to burst into a verse of a team anthem , as nothing unusual .
but on june 5 , the singing wo n't be about sports .
instead , gelsenkirchen 's stadium will house an enormous choir concert .
around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .
the concert marks the conclusion of a special musical weekend in the ruhr region . ! sing is the name of the project that serves as one of the high points of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
the goal is that singers will keep going from morning until night and fill the area with music .
at 12:10 on june 5 , church bells will pick up the tune of herbert groenemeyer 's " komm zur ruhr " -lrb- " come to the ruhr " -rrb- simultaneously in all of the ruhr region 's cities .

now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .

old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .

" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 28.05.2010 can turkey save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is currently the fastest growing economy in europe with the european economy floundering , turkey - which underwent its own crisis in 2001 - has become a model of stability , boasting robust growth and a secure banking system .
now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

" millatfacebook is pakistan 's very own first social networking site .
a site for muslims by muslims where sweet people of other religions are also welcome . " this is the statement that greets you when you go to millatfacebook.com.
the six young entrepreneurs who created the site say it is for muslims to interact online .
the urdu word " millat " means " nation " . the new site has already attracted over 4,300 members .
some of the members say they joined so that they could stay in touch with their friends when facebook was blocked .
others see the site as an alternative for muslims angered by the american site . " a service that does not hurt the sentiments of any religion " the founders of the site write on the page that they have set up their alternative site because of facebook 's refusal to take the complaints of muslims seriously . " the reason behind the launching of millatfacebook is very simple , " azhar siddique , an advocate and one of the site 's co-founders , told deutsche welle . " facebook was basically meant to disturb the thoughts of islam as well as certain other religions ; as far as millatfacebook is concerned , it is going to provide a service which wo n't hurt the sentiments of any religion .
it is open for all – it is only meant for social networking and there should be no direct or indirect hurt to anybody in any case whatsoever . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook.com founder mark zuckerberg at his office in palo alto - his site has over 400 million users worldwide blasphemous " prophet-drawing competition " earlier this month , a user of the popular american social networking site posted an initiative called " everybody draw mohammad day " – they called on members to draw the prophet in order to promote so-called " freedom of expression " .
the depiction of any prophet is considered blasphemous by islam and is prohibited . in response to the post , some muslim activists and students took to the streets of pakistan to protest .
facebook received hundreds of complaints . a court in lahore imposed a ban on the site , which the pakistan telecommunications authority then implemented .
it also blocked youtube for displaying what it considered " sacrilegious content " and restricted access to hundreds of other websites . facebook 's statistics state that the site has some 400 million users worldwide .
in pakistan , there are some 2.5 million users . goal to become biggest muslim social networking site therefore , with fewer than 5,000 members , millatfacebook has some way to go if it wants to catch up with the original facebook .
however , the goal is to become the biggest muslim social networking site in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry islamic activists protest against a page on facebook inviting members to draw prophet mohammad with members from countries as far flung as britain , russia and canada , the founders are satisfied that they are already on the way . but dr hasan askari rizvi , an international relations expert and facebook user , had his doubts : " i think the whole facebook issue has become more of an issue in pakistan .
there is less controversy in any other islamic countries and therefore this facebook may just be a pakistani enterprise .
it is not going to take off in the other countries . " " faith should be strong enough to counter blasphemy " however , even in pakistan , the site has its critics , who say that the online experience is far from adequate .
others , such as amara , an associate professor of english at punjab university , simply could not see the point in a new site . " if it succeeds in replacing the old facebook there will still maybe be the same issues .
if you make your own room dark and close your own eyes , how does that stop people from harming you ? " she asked . " our faith should be strong enough no matter how many facebooks there are , whether there are one or a million , our faith should be strong enough to be able to counter blasphemy against the prophet . " pakistan lifted the ban on youtube earlier this week .
facebook is expected to be banned until the end of the month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 28.05.2010 jamming of dw is part of ethiopia 's campaign against press freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dw reporter interviews an election helper in ethiopia .
coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

sabotage by maoist rebels is suspected .
the death toll is likely to rise as hundreds remain trapped . the disaster occurred in the early hours of the morning when most passengers were sleeping .
it took several hours for police and medical crews to reach the site .
the indian air force and other security agencies immediately launched a massive rescue operation . the area where the accident occurred is a known maoist stronghold in west bengal where there has been a wave of recent attacks . bildunterschrift : it took hours for police and medical teams to get to the site of the crash confusion initially prevailed on the exact cause of the disaster .
some officials blamed an explosion , but passengers who had managed to escape said they heard no blast . police who combed the site said that metal parts used to hold sections of track together were missing and had apparently been removed in an act of sabotage .
but initially indian railway minister mamata banerjee who rushed to the site , said the crash was a result of a bomb blast . " i do n't know why innocent lives have been lost , " he said .
" this is not acceptable .
there was a bomb blast up and down both lines .
the home ministry must investigate the matter and book the culprits .
we do n't want any passengers ' lives compromised . " indian rail network is a soft target with more than 20 million passengers travelling each day on its vast network , the indian railway is a soft target that maoists have attacked several times in the past . bhupinder singh , the police chief of west bengal , also blamed the maoist rebels , saying an outfit called the people 's committee to prevent police atrocities , a front organization , had claimed responsibility for the incident . " it is now clear that the derailment was caused by the removal of the pin drill clips .
that ’ s what caused the sabotage , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens were killed in the accident that has been blamed on maoist rebels sampat mandal , a laborer who was injured in the accident , said it took him over two hours to extricate himself from the mangled heap .
" i am looking for my brother , i ca n't find him , i do n't know where he is .
there are many who are dead .
when the train was hit i managed to get out but after it was hit by the good train many more died . " ninth major strike blamed on maoists this is the ninth major strike since february this year and the third attack on trains blamed on the leftist rebels who claim to be fighting for the poor and landless tribals in east and central india . the armed rebels , whose influence runs in 34 regions of eight states , had declared a " black week " starting midnight thursday , a period of strikes and stepped-up activities against the government . last month , more than 70 military officers were killed in an attack in the central state of chhattisgarh , and on may 17 a bus carrying civilians and policemen was bombed and 20 people were killed in the same area . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons .

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .
tauss has said he will appeal the conviction. rc / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .

now apple appears poised to take command of the e-reader market .
is the device a godsend for consumers , or the damnation of the publishing industry ? the modern german word for newspaper , zeitung , originally referred to a tiding , or a piece of news , that was spread verbally in the middle ages .
it was only when those news snippets were printed on paper that the word 's meaning shifted to refer to the medium itself . but now the newspaper 's 400-year history is at a crossroads .
like other classic media , the newspaper and magazine industries are being forced to redefine themselves in the digital age - and in the wake of economic tumult . struggling with stagnation germany is the largest newspaper market in europe and the fifth largest in the world .
20 million daily newspapers are sold across the nation every day , with another 5 million weeklies and weekend editions on top of that . but the news publishing sector is struggling .
sales and subscriptions are declining , and the economic downturn has forced many companies to slash their advertising budgets .
advertising income currently accounts for about half of a newspaper 's revenue - just one decade ago it financed two-thirds of a publisher 's operation . " over the course of 2009 , the advertising market in regional daily newspapers dwindled by 12.1 percent with a similar decline in advertising-related sales , " anja pasquay of the bdvz , the federation of german newspaper publishers , told deutsche welle . if the economy does n't take an upswing soon , pasquay warns , publishers can expect to see households canceling their newspaper subscriptions or sharing them with others . the good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 400 years , the newspaper is set to change in a big way but there is hope on the horizon .
the arrival of e-readers such as amazon 's kindle , the sony ereader , and apple 's ipad is " good news for publishers , " according to the vdz , germany 's largest trade association of magazine publishers .
creating digital content for e-readers is one way for publishers to boost business . " e-publishing can be a real game-changer for publishers looking to tap into new sources of revenue from content , reach new target groups , and attract new advertisers , " alexander von reibnitz , the vdz 's director of digital media and new markets , told deutsche welle . e-readers with mobile internet capability can even transmit data about the user 's location and online behavior , helping publishers and advertisers provide content tailored to the user . the bad news but having electronics manufacturers join the publishing game has its downsides : apple could take as much as a 30 percent chunk of the profit pie , according to some estimates .
the company already eats up 10 to 15 percent of every us $ 0.99 cent music download , which is hard enough for music labels to swallow . " publishers need to control the distribution platforms and not merely serve as content providers to fully reap the fruits of this new business area , " von reibnitz said . publishers rely heavily upon knowing their readership .
but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .
news corporation , conde nast , hearst corporation , meredith , and time inc. set up next issue media as a platform to sell and distribute content directly to consumers .
germany 's gruner + jahr recently announced a similar initiative . bildunterschrift : e-readers can send your friends messages such as " i 'm busy reading , so leave me alone " good deal , or rotten apple ? another potential problem involves the freedom of press , von reibnitz says : " apple tends to take a close look at the content , and in some cases , remove content providers , even when it 's not entirely clear why they 're taking out one or the other application . " " it 's very important to publishers -lrb- that they -rrb- retain ownership of the content and can decide what can be published – according to the extent of the law , of course . " earlier this year , apple " cleaned up " its app store , removing 5,000 " dirty " apps .
the german newspaper bild was affected , which is known for its flashy and fleshy front-page photos .
the vdz criticized apple 's behavior as " unfair , arbitrary , and damaging to business . " shifting their core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from newsstand to pet supplies , diversification is the key to successful e-business however publishers will work with third parties in the future , one thing is certain : selling the printed or virtual page alone will not suffice .
over the past 15 years , major german newspaper publishers have been shifting away from their core business of printing papers and reinventing themselves as media production companies . but the majority of newspaper publishing houses in germany are small or mid-sized - local or regional operations - each with its own distinct style .
" that 's what gives the german newspaper industry its charm and diversity , " said pasquay . " you 're not talking about just two or three different business strategies , but rather 200 or 300 industry-wide . " diversification is essential for magazine publishers as well , says von reibnitz : " i think the publishers are very innovative in testing new business models and expanding into completely new areas of business , which in some cases do n't have much to do with publishing anymore . " von reibnitz points to the axel springer publishing house , whose digital endeavors , including classified ads , now account for 20 percent of its total sales . meanwhile , around 50 percent of revenue at magazine publisher hubert burda 's digital subsidiary are transaction-based thanks to its stakes in an online pet supply store and other e-commerce platforms including xing , a european social networking site for professionals .
similarly , the stuttgart-based holtzbrinck now owns studivz , the german rival of facebook . as german publishers develop new business models for digital frontier markets , the zeitung business looks set to change forever . author : brian louis ramirez editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is the device a godsend for consumers , or the damnation of the publishing industry ? the modern german word for newspaper , zeitung , originally referred to a tiding , or a piece of news , that was spread verbally in the middle ages .
it was only when those news snippets were printed on paper that the word 's meaning shifted to refer to the medium itself . but now the newspaper 's 400-year history is at a crossroads .
like other classic media , the newspaper and magazine industries are being forced to redefine themselves in the digital age - and in the wake of economic tumult . struggling with stagnation germany is the largest newspaper market in europe and the fifth largest in the world .
20 million daily newspapers are sold across the nation every day , with another 5 million weeklies and weekend editions on top of that . but the news publishing sector is struggling .
sales and subscriptions are declining , and the economic downturn has forced many companies to slash their advertising budgets .
advertising income currently accounts for about half of a newspaper 's revenue - just one decade ago it financed two-thirds of a publisher 's operation . " over the course of 2009 , the advertising market in regional daily newspapers dwindled by 12.1 percent with a similar decline in advertising-related sales , " anja pasquay of the bdvz , the federation of german newspaper publishers , told deutsche welle . if the economy does n't take an upswing soon , pasquay warns , publishers can expect to see households canceling their newspaper subscriptions or sharing them with others . the good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 400 years , the newspaper is set to change in a big way but there is hope on the horizon .

" e-publishing can be a real game-changer for publishers looking to tap into new sources of revenue from content , reach new target groups , and attract new advertisers , " alexander von reibnitz , the vdz 's director of digital media and new markets , told deutsche welle . e-readers with mobile internet capability can even transmit data about the user 's location and online behavior , helping publishers and advertisers provide content tailored to the user . the bad news but having electronics manufacturers join the publishing game has its downsides : apple could take as much as a 30 percent chunk of the profit pie , according to some estimates .
the company already eats up 10 to 15 percent of every us $ 0.99 cent music download , which is hard enough for music labels to swallow . " publishers need to control the distribution platforms and not merely serve as content providers to fully reap the fruits of this new business area , " von reibnitz said . publishers rely heavily upon knowing their readership .
but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .

now apple appears poised to take command of the e-reader market .
is the device a godsend for consumers , or the damnation of the publishing industry ? the modern german word for newspaper , zeitung , originally referred to a tiding , or a piece of news , that was spread verbally in the middle ages .
it was only when those news snippets were printed on paper that the word 's meaning shifted to refer to the medium itself . but now the newspaper 's 400-year history is at a crossroads .
like other classic media , the newspaper and magazine industries are being forced to redefine themselves in the digital age - and in the wake of economic tumult . struggling with stagnation germany is the largest newspaper market in europe and the fifth largest in the world .
20 million daily newspapers are sold across the nation every day , with another 5 million weeklies and weekend editions on top of that . but the news publishing sector is struggling .
sales and subscriptions are declining , and the economic downturn has forced many companies to slash their advertising budgets .
advertising income currently accounts for about half of a newspaper 's revenue - just one decade ago it financed two-thirds of a publisher 's operation . " over the course of 2009 , the advertising market in regional daily newspapers dwindled by 12.1 percent with a similar decline in advertising-related sales , " anja pasquay of the bdvz , the federation of german newspaper publishers , told deutsche welle . if the economy does n't take an upswing soon , pasquay warns , publishers can expect to see households canceling their newspaper subscriptions or sharing them with others . the good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 400 years , the newspaper is set to change in a big way but there is hope on the horizon .
the arrival of e-readers such as amazon 's kindle , the sony ereader , and apple 's ipad is " good news for publishers , " according to the vdz , germany 's largest trade association of magazine publishers .
creating digital content for e-readers is one way for publishers to boost business . " e-publishing can be a real game-changer for publishers looking to tap into new sources of revenue from content , reach new target groups , and attract new advertisers , " alexander von reibnitz , the vdz 's director of digital media and new markets , told deutsche welle . e-readers with mobile internet capability can even transmit data about the user 's location and online behavior , helping publishers and advertisers provide content tailored to the user . the bad news but having electronics manufacturers join the publishing game has its downsides : apple could take as much as a 30 percent chunk of the profit pie , according to some estimates .
the company already eats up 10 to 15 percent of every us $ 0.99 cent music download , which is hard enough for music labels to swallow . " publishers need to control the distribution platforms and not merely serve as content providers to fully reap the fruits of this new business area , " von reibnitz said . publishers rely heavily upon knowing their readership .
but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .
news corporation , conde nast , hearst corporation , meredith , and time inc. set up next issue media as a platform to sell and distribute content directly to consumers .
germany 's gruner + jahr recently announced a similar initiative . bildunterschrift : e-readers can send your friends messages such as " i 'm busy reading , so leave me alone " good deal , or rotten apple ? another potential problem involves the freedom of press , von reibnitz says : " apple tends to take a close look at the content , and in some cases , remove content providers , even when it 's not entirely clear why they 're taking out one or the other application . " " it 's very important to publishers -lrb- that they -rrb- retain ownership of the content and can decide what can be published – according to the extent of the law , of course . " earlier this year , apple " cleaned up " its app store , removing 5,000 " dirty " apps .
the german newspaper bild was affected , which is known for its flashy and fleshy front-page photos .
the vdz criticized apple 's behavior as " unfair , arbitrary , and damaging to business . " shifting their core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from newsstand to pet supplies , diversification is the key to successful e-business however publishers will work with third parties in the future , one thing is certain : selling the printed or virtual page alone will not suffice .
over the past 15 years , major german newspaper publishers have been shifting away from their core business of printing papers and reinventing themselves as media production companies . but the majority of newspaper publishing houses in germany are small or mid-sized - local or regional operations - each with its own distinct style .
" that 's what gives the german newspaper industry its charm and diversity , " said pasquay . " you 're not talking about just two or three different business strategies , but rather 200 or 300 industry-wide . " diversification is essential for magazine publishers as well , says von reibnitz : " i think the publishers are very innovative in testing new business models and expanding into completely new areas of business , which in some cases do n't have much to do with publishing anymore . " von reibnitz points to the axel springer publishing house , whose digital endeavors , including classified ads , now account for 20 percent of its total sales . meanwhile , around 50 percent of revenue at magazine publisher hubert burda 's digital subsidiary are transaction-based thanks to its stakes in an online pet supply store and other e-commerce platforms including xing , a european social networking site for professionals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 28.05.2010 pakistani social networking site for muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millatfacebook.com has already attracted well over 4,000 members millatfacebook has been set up by six it students in the eastern city of lahore who were angered by a " prophet drawing competition " organized by a user of the original us-based social networking site facebook . " millatfacebook is pakistan 's very own first social networking site .
a site for muslims by muslims where sweet people of other religions are also welcome . " this is the statement that greets you when you go to millatfacebook.com.
the six young entrepreneurs who created the site say it is for muslims to interact online .
the urdu word " millat " means " nation " . the new site has already attracted over 4,300 members .
some of the members say they joined so that they could stay in touch with their friends when facebook was blocked .
others see the site as an alternative for muslims angered by the american site . " a service that does not hurt the sentiments of any religion " the founders of the site write on the page that they have set up their alternative site because of facebook 's refusal to take the complaints of muslims seriously . " the reason behind the launching of millatfacebook is very simple , " azhar siddique , an advocate and one of the site 's co-founders , told deutsche welle . " facebook was basically meant to disturb the thoughts of islam as well as certain other religions ; as far as millatfacebook is concerned , it is going to provide a service which wo n't hurt the sentiments of any religion .
it is open for all – it is only meant for social networking and there should be no direct or indirect hurt to anybody in any case whatsoever . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook.com founder mark zuckerberg at his office in palo alto - his site has over 400 million users worldwide blasphemous " prophet-drawing competition " earlier this month , a user of the popular american social networking site posted an initiative called " everybody draw mohammad day " – they called on members to draw the prophet in order to promote so-called " freedom of expression " .
the depiction of any prophet is considered blasphemous by islam and is prohibited . in response to the post , some muslim activists and students took to the streets of pakistan to protest .
facebook received hundreds of complaints . a court in lahore imposed a ban on the site , which the pakistan telecommunications authority then implemented .
it also blocked youtube for displaying what it considered " sacrilegious content " and restricted access to hundreds of other websites . facebook 's statistics state that the site has some 400 million users worldwide .
in pakistan , there are some 2.5 million users . goal to become biggest muslim social networking site therefore , with fewer than 5,000 members , millatfacebook has some way to go if it wants to catch up with the original facebook .
however , the goal is to become the biggest muslim social networking site in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry islamic activists protest against a page on facebook inviting members to draw prophet mohammad with members from countries as far flung as britain , russia and canada , the founders are satisfied that they are already on the way . but dr hasan askari rizvi , an international relations expert and facebook user , had his doubts : " i think the whole facebook issue has become more of an issue in pakistan .
there is less controversy in any other islamic countries and therefore this facebook may just be a pakistani enterprise .
it is not going to take off in the other countries . " " faith should be strong enough to counter blasphemy " however , even in pakistan , the site has its critics , who say that the online experience is far from adequate .
others , such as amara , an associate professor of english at punjab university , simply could not see the point in a new site . " if it succeeds in replacing the old facebook there will still maybe be the same issues .

" millatfacebook is pakistan 's very own first social networking site .
a site for muslims by muslims where sweet people of other religions are also welcome . " this is the statement that greets you when you go to millatfacebook.com.
the six young entrepreneurs who created the site say it is for muslims to interact online .
the urdu word " millat " means " nation " . the new site has already attracted over 4,300 members .
some of the members say they joined so that they could stay in touch with their friends when facebook was blocked .
others see the site as an alternative for muslims angered by the american site . " a service that does not hurt the sentiments of any religion " the founders of the site write on the page that they have set up their alternative site because of facebook 's refusal to take the complaints of muslims seriously . " the reason behind the launching of millatfacebook is very simple , " azhar siddique , an advocate and one of the site 's co-founders , told deutsche welle . " facebook was basically meant to disturb the thoughts of islam as well as certain other religions ; as far as millatfacebook is concerned , it is going to provide a service which wo n't hurt the sentiments of any religion .
it is open for all – it is only meant for social networking and there should be no direct or indirect hurt to anybody in any case whatsoever . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook.com founder mark zuckerberg at his office in palo alto - his site has over 400 million users worldwide blasphemous " prophet-drawing competition " earlier this month , a user of the popular american social networking site posted an initiative called " everybody draw mohammad day " – they called on members to draw the prophet in order to promote so-called " freedom of expression " .
the depiction of any prophet is considered blasphemous by islam and is prohibited . in response to the post , some muslim activists and students took to the streets of pakistan to protest .
facebook received hundreds of complaints . a court in lahore imposed a ban on the site , which the pakistan telecommunications authority then implemented .
it also blocked youtube for displaying what it considered " sacrilegious content " and restricted access to hundreds of other websites . facebook 's statistics state that the site has some 400 million users worldwide .
in pakistan , there are some 2.5 million users . goal to become biggest muslim social networking site therefore , with fewer than 5,000 members , millatfacebook has some way to go if it wants to catch up with the original facebook .
however , the goal is to become the biggest muslim social networking site in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry islamic activists protest against a page on facebook inviting members to draw prophet mohammad with members from countries as far flung as britain , russia and canada , the founders are satisfied that they are already on the way . but dr hasan askari rizvi , an international relations expert and facebook user , had his doubts : " i think the whole facebook issue has become more of an issue in pakistan .
there is less controversy in any other islamic countries and therefore this facebook may just be a pakistani enterprise .
it is not going to take off in the other countries . " " faith should be strong enough to counter blasphemy " however , even in pakistan , the site has its critics , who say that the online experience is far from adequate .
others , such as amara , an associate professor of english at punjab university , simply could not see the point in a new site . " if it succeeds in replacing the old facebook there will still maybe be the same issues .
if you make your own room dark and close your own eyes , how does that stop people from harming you ? " she asked . " our faith should be strong enough no matter how many facebooks there are , whether there are one or a million , our faith should be strong enough to be able to counter blasphemy against the prophet .

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .
tauss has said he will appeal the conviction. rc / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .

hayward said the company would know if its " top kill " operation had worked within 48 hours , but that there were already some signs of success .

the firm awaits the results as us president barack obama visits the area . oil giant bp puts its chances of blocking the seabed leak that has gushed oil into the gulf of mexico for the past three weeks at about 60 to 70 percent .
" we have wrestled it to the ground , but we have n't put a bullet in its head yet , " bp ceo tony hayward told news agency reuters while inspecting the spill site by helicopter .
hayward said the company would know if its " top kill " operation had worked within 48 hours , but that there were already some signs of success .
the process involves the injection of thousands of barrels of mud into the well to plug the leak , which has surpassed the 1989 exxon valdez disaster as the worst oil spill in us history .
obama visits coast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louisiana residents have pleaded for help from the us government hayward spoke as us president barack obama visited grand isle , louisiana , where he reiterated he would hold bp accountable for cleaning up the spill .
obama vowed that vigorous action would be taken to fight the spill and repeated his assertion that " buck stops with me . "
the president said a team of government scientists was looking at contingency plans in case the bp effort failed .
on his visit , obama inspected oil-trapping booms at a beach in port fourchon , one of the areas most affected by oil from the spill being washed ashore .
spain , the netherlands and the european union have offered equipment to help the united states with the clean-up .
the european commission said that it had received a request from the us coast guard to help provide skimmers to help recover oil. rc / afp / ap / reuters editor : andrew bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .
tauss has said he will appeal the conviction. rc / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves .

but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .

' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .
tauss has said he will appeal the conviction. rc / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the death toll is likely to rise as hundreds remain trapped . the disaster occurred in the early hours of the morning when most passengers were sleeping .
it took several hours for police and medical crews to reach the site .
the indian air force and other security agencies immediately launched a massive rescue operation . the area where the accident occurred is a known maoist stronghold in west bengal where there has been a wave of recent attacks . bildunterschrift : it took hours for police and medical teams to get to the site of the crash confusion initially prevailed on the exact cause of the disaster .
some officials blamed an explosion , but passengers who had managed to escape said they heard no blast . police who combed the site said that metal parts used to hold sections of track together were missing and had apparently been removed in an act of sabotage .
but initially indian railway minister mamata banerjee who rushed to the site , said the crash was a result of a bomb blast . " i do n't know why innocent lives have been lost , " he said .
" this is not acceptable .
there was a bomb blast up and down both lines .
the home ministry must investigate the matter and book the culprits .

at least 70 people were killed . armed militants , some of them wearing suicide vests , stormed two mosques in lahore 's model town and garhi shahu after friday prayers . they hurled grenades and fired at worshippers , and also took hostages in attacks that were extremely well-coordinated , officials said . the two mosques are frequented by members of the minority muslim ahmadi community that was founded in the late 19th century .
followers regard mirza ghulam ahmad , a mystic born in 1835 , as the messiah .
but many orthodox muslims consider ahmadis to be heretics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people gather outside the garhi shahu mosque after friday 's attacks death toll could rise at least 70 people were killed and almost 80 were injured .
officials feared , however , that the death toll could increase . at least three of the gunmen blew themselves up with suicide vests packed with explosives when police tried to enter one of the buildings . the police were still searching the area on friday afternoon because at least two attackers were still at large .
one attacker had been arrested . the reuters news agency quoted punjab 's law minister rana sanaullah as saying the arrested attacker was a teenage pashtun .
pashtuns are the majority ethnic group in parts of northern pakistan and afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers and others take cover near damaged vehicles pakistani taliban suspected although it remained unclear who was behind the attacks , officials said suspicion had fallen on the pakistani taliban .
some local media reported that a group related to the taliban had claimed responsibility . shahbaz sharif , the chief minister of punjab , of which lahore is the capital , condemned the attacks and vowed to continue fighting against extremism . " it 's a reminder to the nation that pakistan will achieve its destiny only after we get rid of the worst type of extremism and fundamentalism , " he told a news conference . friday 's shootings were the worst attacks to take place in pakistan since suicide blasts on march 12 killed 57 people . du / reuters / afp / dpa / ap editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .
tauss has said he will appeal the conviction. rc / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 28.05.2010 can turkey save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is currently the fastest growing economy in europe with the european economy floundering , turkey - which underwent its own crisis in 2001 - has become a model of stability , boasting robust growth and a secure banking system .
now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .

from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .

there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .
there are no prizes at theater of the world , since the festival does n't seek to foster competition among participants .
instead , the focus is on the exchange and presentation of different perspectives .
also , performance spaces are n't limited to classical theater venues .
they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .

but on june 5 , the singing wo n't be about sports .
instead , gelsenkirchen 's stadium will house an enormous choir concert .
around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .
festival director frie leysen from belgium travelled across the globe to select this year 's artists .
there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .

they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 28.05.2010 can turkey save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is currently the fastest growing economy in europe with the european economy floundering , turkey - which underwent its own crisis in 2001 - has become a model of stability , boasting robust growth and a secure banking system .
now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .

in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .

typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .

the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .

from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 28.05.2010 can turkey save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is currently the fastest growing economy in europe with the european economy floundering , turkey - which underwent its own crisis in 2001 - has become a model of stability , boasting robust growth and a secure banking system .
now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .
the debt crisis in greece could even exacerbate lending conditions and thus jeopardize any signs of an upswing in the economy .
" the credit crunch -lsb- lack of access to credit -rsb- is still the nemesis of german companies at the moment , " said german retail association managing director stefan genth. ng / reuters / apn editor : john blau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

the new guarantee comes as markets grow more sensitive about exposure to government debt . german nationalized bank hypo real estate has received an extra 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.3 billion -rrb- in public loan guarantees to protect it from renewed market turbulence .
the german government 's bank rescue fund soffin said on friday that it was extending its guarantee level to 103.5 billion euros because of " the current situation on financial markets . "
fund head hannes rehm said that the bank required the guarantees as it carried out a restructuring program .
any failure of that restructuring process " would have huge consequences for the german economy , " said rehm .
government bonds pose risk the bank , which specializes in property-lending and municipal financing , is at risk from potential losses on bonds it owns that were issued by troubled eurozone countries such as greece , spain , ireland and portugal .
the bank had around 39 billion euros in exposure to such " sovereign debt " at the end of march .
the worsening of the greek debt crisis and fears that similar problems would spread to other european economies have made bond exposure a sensitive issue on money markets .
hypo real estate , the most prominent german casualty of the financial crisis , ran into trouble in 2008 .
it was nationalized by the government the following year after successive loan guarantees and capital injections were provided by the state. rc / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.05.2010 dutch groups want to expand assisted suicide rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you no longer want to live , do you have an automatic right to die ?
assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

french president nicolas sarkozy and former national team star zinedine zidane supported their country 's bid in a presentation to uefa .

the 2016 event will be the third time france has staged the finals after 1960 and 1984 .
france also hosted the world cup in 1998 .
france has promised to invest some 1.7 billion euros to build four new stadiums in bordeaux , lyon , lille and nice and renovate eight others before selecting nine venues to host the 51 matches , which are held over a one-month period .

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the end … there will be base closures , " guttenberg said friday on german public television .
" we can either ignore this for the next few years , and then give the concerned parties a terrible shock when the moment comes .
or we can give them a chance to at least mentally prepare for this now , " the christian democrat politician said .

in a speech on wednesday , he said he hoped to save 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- a year in the german army , but the specific details have n't been worked out .
in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , the head of the armed forces association ulrich kirsch criticized the proposals , calling the savings measures a " paradigm shift " with profound consequences for the bundeswehr .
" minister zu guttenberg said that the attractiveness of the armed forces should not suffer under the savings measures .
i 'm very skeptical about that , " kirsch told the station mdr info .

in his interview with ard , guttenberg stressed that base closures stood " at the bottom of the list " of austerity measures .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .
the debt crisis in greece could even exacerbate lending conditions and thus jeopardize any signs of an upswing in the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 28.05.2010 cosmopolitan berliners prefer english , except in the theater großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a decade ago the sound of english in central berlin still had a slight scent of the exotic about it , these days its flat vowels can be heard on pretty much any street corner - but less so in cinemas and theaters . call it european , call it progress or call it money saved on a german phrasebook - it 's a contemporary berlin truth that you can get by on english .
whereas once upon a time buying salami or ordering coffee in anything but perfect -lrb- and suitably gruff sounding -rrb- german would have elicited horrified exclamations of " wie bitte ? " , bi-lingual employees have now become a feature of the city 's growing service industry .
and they are n't the only ones afraid to step outside the german language fold .
everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .
it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .
and who can blame them ?
imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .
and even if they did , there is a belief that germans - including those intent on sending their children to bi-lingual schools - would not come to watch .
because what they really want from english is to understand the lingo of international media , technology , fashion and business .
and that means they are quite content to listen to the bard , if they listen at all , in translation . so for the time being , the choice of original cinema and theater in berlin is likely to remain restricted .
but perhaps when all those infants currently taking lessons in baa baa black sheep have made it through school , they will inject a touch more linguistic variety onto the screens and stages of the german capital . tamsin walker enjoys film and theater in both english and german in berlin .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sabotage by maoist rebels is suspected .
the death toll is likely to rise as hundreds remain trapped . the disaster occurred in the early hours of the morning when most passengers were sleeping .
it took several hours for police and medical crews to reach the site .
the indian air force and other security agencies immediately launched a massive rescue operation . the area where the accident occurred is a known maoist stronghold in west bengal where there has been a wave of recent attacks . bildunterschrift : it took hours for police and medical teams to get to the site of the crash confusion initially prevailed on the exact cause of the disaster .
some officials blamed an explosion , but passengers who had managed to escape said they heard no blast . police who combed the site said that metal parts used to hold sections of track together were missing and had apparently been removed in an act of sabotage .
but initially indian railway minister mamata banerjee who rushed to the site , said the crash was a result of a bomb blast . " i do n't know why innocent lives have been lost , " he said .
" this is not acceptable .
there was a bomb blast up and down both lines .
the home ministry must investigate the matter and book the culprits .
we do n't want any passengers ' lives compromised . " indian rail network is a soft target with more than 20 million passengers travelling each day on its vast network , the indian railway is a soft target that maoists have attacked several times in the past . bhupinder singh , the police chief of west bengal , also blamed the maoist rebels , saying an outfit called the people 's committee to prevent police atrocities , a front organization , had claimed responsibility for the incident . " it is now clear that the derailment was caused by the removal of the pin drill clips .
that ’ s what caused the sabotage , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens were killed in the accident that has been blamed on maoist rebels sampat mandal , a laborer who was injured in the accident , said it took him over two hours to extricate himself from the mangled heap .
" i am looking for my brother , i ca n't find him , i do n't know where he is .
there are many who are dead .
when the train was hit i managed to get out but after it was hit by the good train many more died . " ninth major strike blamed on maoists this is the ninth major strike since february this year and the third attack on trains blamed on the leftist rebels who claim to be fighting for the poor and landless tribals in east and central india . the armed rebels , whose influence runs in 34 regions of eight states , had declared a " black week " starting midnight thursday , a period of strikes and stepped-up activities against the government . last month , more than 70 military officers were killed in an attack in the central state of chhattisgarh , and on may 17 a bus carrying civilians and policemen was bombed and 20 people were killed in the same area . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

local municipalities and military advocates have criticized the controversial plan . in an effort to slash defense spending , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said that there is no way around the closing of the german military bases .
" in the end … there will be base closures , " guttenberg said friday on german public television .
" we can either ignore this for the next few years , and then give the concerned parties a terrible shock when the moment comes .
or we can give them a chance to at least mentally prepare for this now , " the christian democrat politician said .
paradigm shift guttenberg has announced radical reductions in the face of federal budget constraints .
in a speech on wednesday , he said he hoped to save 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- a year in the german army , but the specific details have n't been worked out .
in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , the head of the armed forces association ulrich kirsch criticized the proposals , calling the savings measures a " paradigm shift " with profound consequences for the bundeswehr .
" minister zu guttenberg said that the attractiveness of the armed forces should not suffer under the savings measures .
i 'm very skeptical about that , " kirsch told the station mdr info .
loss of revenue a closure of military barracks would also mean a severe blow to the communities that house the troops .

in his interview with ard , guttenberg stressed that base closures stood " at the bottom of the list " of austerity measures .

" millatfacebook is pakistan 's very own first social networking site .
a site for muslims by muslims where sweet people of other religions are also welcome . " this is the statement that greets you when you go to millatfacebook.com.
the six young entrepreneurs who created the site say it is for muslims to interact online .
the urdu word " millat " means " nation " . the new site has already attracted over 4,300 members .
some of the members say they joined so that they could stay in touch with their friends when facebook was blocked .
others see the site as an alternative for muslims angered by the american site . " a service that does not hurt the sentiments of any religion " the founders of the site write on the page that they have set up their alternative site because of facebook 's refusal to take the complaints of muslims seriously . " the reason behind the launching of millatfacebook is very simple , " azhar siddique , an advocate and one of the site 's co-founders , told deutsche welle . " facebook was basically meant to disturb the thoughts of islam as well as certain other religions ; as far as millatfacebook is concerned , it is going to provide a service which wo n't hurt the sentiments of any religion .
it is open for all – it is only meant for social networking and there should be no direct or indirect hurt to anybody in any case whatsoever . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook.com founder mark zuckerberg at his office in palo alto - his site has over 400 million users worldwide blasphemous " prophet-drawing competition " earlier this month , a user of the popular american social networking site posted an initiative called " everybody draw mohammad day " – they called on members to draw the prophet in order to promote so-called " freedom of expression " .
the depiction of any prophet is considered blasphemous by islam and is prohibited . in response to the post , some muslim activists and students took to the streets of pakistan to protest .
facebook received hundreds of complaints . a court in lahore imposed a ban on the site , which the pakistan telecommunications authority then implemented .
it also blocked youtube for displaying what it considered " sacrilegious content " and restricted access to hundreds of other websites . facebook 's statistics state that the site has some 400 million users worldwide .
in pakistan , there are some 2.5 million users . goal to become biggest muslim social networking site therefore , with fewer than 5,000 members , millatfacebook has some way to go if it wants to catch up with the original facebook .
however , the goal is to become the biggest muslim social networking site in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry islamic activists protest against a page on facebook inviting members to draw prophet mohammad with members from countries as far flung as britain , russia and canada , the founders are satisfied that they are already on the way . but dr hasan askari rizvi , an international relations expert and facebook user , had his doubts : " i think the whole facebook issue has become more of an issue in pakistan .
there is less controversy in any other islamic countries and therefore this facebook may just be a pakistani enterprise .
it is not going to take off in the other countries . " " faith should be strong enough to counter blasphemy " however , even in pakistan , the site has its critics , who say that the online experience is far from adequate .
others , such as amara , an associate professor of english at punjab university , simply could not see the point in a new site . " if it succeeds in replacing the old facebook there will still maybe be the same issues .
if you make your own room dark and close your own eyes , how does that stop people from harming you ? " she asked . " our faith should be strong enough no matter how many facebooks there are , whether there are one or a million , our faith should be strong enough to be able to counter blasphemy against the prophet . " pakistan lifted the ban on youtube earlier this week .

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

local municipalities and military advocates have criticized the controversial plan . in an effort to slash defense spending , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said that there is no way around the closing of the german military bases .
" in the end … there will be base closures , " guttenberg said friday on german public television .
" we can either ignore this for the next few years , and then give the concerned parties a terrible shock when the moment comes .
or we can give them a chance to at least mentally prepare for this now , " the christian democrat politician said .
paradigm shift guttenberg has announced radical reductions in the face of federal budget constraints .
in a speech on wednesday , he said he hoped to save 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- a year in the german army , but the specific details have n't been worked out .
in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , the head of the armed forces association ulrich kirsch criticized the proposals , calling the savings measures a " paradigm shift " with profound consequences for the bundeswehr .
" minister zu guttenberg said that the attractiveness of the armed forces should not suffer under the savings measures .
i 'm very skeptical about that , " kirsch told the station mdr info .
loss of revenue a closure of military barracks would also mean a severe blow to the communities that house the troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says smaller bases should be closed to save money " we expect that this decision will be made with us , " the chief executive of the german association of cities and municipalities , gerd landsberg , told the financial times germany .
" if the minister says the the armed forces should be more firmly anchored in society , then they can not be withdrawn from the area , " landsberg added .
in his interview with ard , guttenberg stressed that base closures stood " at the bottom of the list " of austerity measures .
the first steps would be cuts to staffing and equipment. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 28.05.2010 cosmopolitan berliners prefer english , except in the theater großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a decade ago the sound of english in central berlin still had a slight scent of the exotic about it , these days its flat vowels can be heard on pretty much any street corner - but less so in cinemas and theaters . call it european , call it progress or call it money saved on a german phrasebook - it 's a contemporary berlin truth that you can get by on english .
whereas once upon a time buying salami or ordering coffee in anything but perfect -lrb- and suitably gruff sounding -rrb- german would have elicited horrified exclamations of " wie bitte ? " , bi-lingual employees have now become a feature of the city 's growing service industry .
and they are n't the only ones afraid to step outside the german language fold .
everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .
it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .
and who can blame them ?
imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .
and even if they did , there is a belief that germans - including those intent on sending their children to bi-lingual schools - would not come to watch .
because what they really want from english is to understand the lingo of international media , technology , fashion and business .
and that means they are quite content to listen to the bard , if they listen at all , in translation . so for the time being , the choice of original cinema and theater in berlin is likely to remain restricted .
but perhaps when all those infants currently taking lessons in baa baa black sheep have made it through school , they will inject a touch more linguistic variety onto the screens and stages of the german capital . tamsin walker enjoys film and theater in both english and german in berlin .

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves .

" millatfacebook is pakistan 's very own first social networking site .

the urdu word " millat " means " nation " . the new site has already attracted over 4,300 members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 28.05.2010 cosmopolitan berliners prefer english , except in the theater großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a decade ago the sound of english in central berlin still had a slight scent of the exotic about it , these days its flat vowels can be heard on pretty much any street corner - but less so in cinemas and theaters . call it european , call it progress or call it money saved on a german phrasebook - it 's a contemporary berlin truth that you can get by on english .
whereas once upon a time buying salami or ordering coffee in anything but perfect -lrb- and suitably gruff sounding -rrb- german would have elicited horrified exclamations of " wie bitte ? " , bi-lingual employees have now become a feature of the city 's growing service industry .
and they are n't the only ones afraid to step outside the german language fold .
everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .
it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .
and who can blame them ?
imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .
and even if they did , there is a belief that germans - including those intent on sending their children to bi-lingual schools - would not come to watch .
because what they really want from english is to understand the lingo of international media , technology , fashion and business .
and that means they are quite content to listen to the bard , if they listen at all , in translation . so for the time being , the choice of original cinema and theater in berlin is likely to remain restricted .
but perhaps when all those infants currently taking lessons in baa baa black sheep have made it through school , they will inject a touch more linguistic variety onto the screens and stages of the german capital . tamsin walker enjoys film and theater in both english and german in berlin .

local municipalities and military advocates have criticized the controversial plan . in an effort to slash defense spending , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said that there is no way around the closing of the german military bases .
" in the end … there will be base closures , " guttenberg said friday on german public television .
" we can either ignore this for the next few years , and then give the concerned parties a terrible shock when the moment comes .
or we can give them a chance to at least mentally prepare for this now , " the christian democrat politician said .
paradigm shift guttenberg has announced radical reductions in the face of federal budget constraints .
in a speech on wednesday , he said he hoped to save 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- a year in the german army , but the specific details have n't been worked out .
in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , the head of the armed forces association ulrich kirsch criticized the proposals , calling the savings measures a " paradigm shift " with profound consequences for the bundeswehr .
" minister zu guttenberg said that the attractiveness of the armed forces should not suffer under the savings measures .
i 'm very skeptical about that , " kirsch told the station mdr info .

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

sabotage by maoist rebels is suspected .
the death toll is likely to rise as hundreds remain trapped . the disaster occurred in the early hours of the morning when most passengers were sleeping .
it took several hours for police and medical crews to reach the site .
the indian air force and other security agencies immediately launched a massive rescue operation . the area where the accident occurred is a known maoist stronghold in west bengal where there has been a wave of recent attacks . bildunterschrift : it took hours for police and medical teams to get to the site of the crash confusion initially prevailed on the exact cause of the disaster .
some officials blamed an explosion , but passengers who had managed to escape said they heard no blast . police who combed the site said that metal parts used to hold sections of track together were missing and had apparently been removed in an act of sabotage .
but initially indian railway minister mamata banerjee who rushed to the site , said the crash was a result of a bomb blast . " i do n't know why innocent lives have been lost , " he said .
" this is not acceptable .
there was a bomb blast up and down both lines .
the home ministry must investigate the matter and book the culprits .
we do n't want any passengers ' lives compromised . " indian rail network is a soft target with more than 20 million passengers travelling each day on its vast network , the indian railway is a soft target that maoists have attacked several times in the past . bhupinder singh , the police chief of west bengal , also blamed the maoist rebels , saying an outfit called the people 's committee to prevent police atrocities , a front organization , had claimed responsibility for the incident . " it is now clear that the derailment was caused by the removal of the pin drill clips .
that ’ s what caused the sabotage , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens were killed in the accident that has been blamed on maoist rebels sampat mandal , a laborer who was injured in the accident , said it took him over two hours to extricate himself from the mangled heap .
" i am looking for my brother , i ca n't find him , i do n't know where he is .
there are many who are dead .
when the train was hit i managed to get out but after it was hit by the good train many more died . " ninth major strike blamed on maoists this is the ninth major strike since february this year and the third attack on trains blamed on the leftist rebels who claim to be fighting for the poor and landless tribals in east and central india . the armed rebels , whose influence runs in 34 regions of eight states , had declared a " black week " starting midnight thursday , a period of strikes and stepped-up activities against the government . last month , more than 70 military officers were killed in an attack in the central state of chhattisgarh , and on may 17 a bus carrying civilians and policemen was bombed and 20 people were killed in the same area . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves .

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .
tauss has said he will appeal the conviction. rc / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .
the 56-year-old resigned in june 2009 from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- three months after his home and offices were raided by investigators .
prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons . "
the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "
after leaving the spd tauss joined the small pirate party , which campaigns for reform to the law regarding internet file-sharing and copyright .
he was later stripped of parliamentary immunity and lost his seat in parliament .
tauss has said he will appeal the conviction. rc / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ex-social democrat joerg tauss received a 15-month suspended prison sentence . a former member of the german parliament has received a suspended prison sentence after he was found guilty of possessing child pornography .
a state court in karlsruhe gave joerg tauss a 15-month suspended sentence after rejecting claims that the pornographic images were necessary for his parliamentary work .

prosecutors said that the investigation revealed he had 228 pornographic pictures and videos on his mobile phone in addition to material found at his home .
images necessary for work tauss admitted that he possessed the material but claimed that they were related to legitimate work he was carrying out in his capacity as a lawmaker , and that the images were to help him break up a pedophile ring .
his defense team had asked that he be acquitted , but the court said tauss was not privileged to any legal exemptions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the judge ruled that tauss was engaged with online pedophilia for personal reasons presiding judge udo scholl said tauss " was not active in the online child pornography scene for political reasons and for the proper performance of his duties , but rather for personal reasons .

the judge said it was possible that tauss had been motivated out of " sheer curiosity . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 28.05.2010 cosmopolitan berliners prefer english , except in the theater großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a decade ago the sound of english in central berlin still had a slight scent of the exotic about it , these days its flat vowels can be heard on pretty much any street corner - but less so in cinemas and theaters . call it european , call it progress or call it money saved on a german phrasebook - it 's a contemporary berlin truth that you can get by on english .
whereas once upon a time buying salami or ordering coffee in anything but perfect -lrb- and suitably gruff sounding -rrb- german would have elicited horrified exclamations of " wie bitte ? " , bi-lingual employees have now become a feature of the city 's growing service industry .
and they are n't the only ones afraid to step outside the german language fold .
everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .
it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .
and who can blame them ?
imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .

last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .

it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .

imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .

everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .
it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .
and who can blame them ?
imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .
and even if they did , there is a belief that germans - including those intent on sending their children to bi-lingual schools - would not come to watch .
because what they really want from english is to understand the lingo of international media , technology , fashion and business .
and that means they are quite content to listen to the bard , if they listen at all , in translation . so for the time being , the choice of original cinema and theater in berlin is likely to remain restricted .
but perhaps when all those infants currently taking lessons in baa baa black sheep have made it through school , they will inject a touch more linguistic variety onto the screens and stages of the german capital . tamsin walker enjoys film and theater in both english and german in berlin .

sabotage by maoist rebels is suspected .
the death toll is likely to rise as hundreds remain trapped . the disaster occurred in the early hours of the morning when most passengers were sleeping .
it took several hours for police and medical crews to reach the site .
the indian air force and other security agencies immediately launched a massive rescue operation . the area where the accident occurred is a known maoist stronghold in west bengal where there has been a wave of recent attacks . bildunterschrift : it took hours for police and medical teams to get to the site of the crash confusion initially prevailed on the exact cause of the disaster .
some officials blamed an explosion , but passengers who had managed to escape said they heard no blast . police who combed the site said that metal parts used to hold sections of track together were missing and had apparently been removed in an act of sabotage .
but initially indian railway minister mamata banerjee who rushed to the site , said the crash was a result of a bomb blast . " i do n't know why innocent lives have been lost , " he said .
" this is not acceptable .
there was a bomb blast up and down both lines .
the home ministry must investigate the matter and book the culprits .
we do n't want any passengers ' lives compromised . " indian rail network is a soft target with more than 20 million passengers travelling each day on its vast network , the indian railway is a soft target that maoists have attacked several times in the past . bhupinder singh , the police chief of west bengal , also blamed the maoist rebels , saying an outfit called the people 's committee to prevent police atrocities , a front organization , had claimed responsibility for the incident . " it is now clear that the derailment was caused by the removal of the pin drill clips .
that ’ s what caused the sabotage , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens were killed in the accident that has been blamed on maoist rebels sampat mandal , a laborer who was injured in the accident , said it took him over two hours to extricate himself from the mangled heap .

there are many who are dead .
when the train was hit i managed to get out but after it was hit by the good train many more died .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .
the debt crisis in greece could even exacerbate lending conditions and thus jeopardize any signs of an upswing in the economy .

but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .
news corporation , conde nast , hearst corporation , meredith , and time inc. set up next issue media as a platform to sell and distribute content directly to consumers .
germany 's gruner + jahr recently announced a similar initiative . bildunterschrift : e-readers can send your friends messages such as " i 'm busy reading , so leave me alone " good deal , or rotten apple ? another potential problem involves the freedom of press , von reibnitz says : " apple tends to take a close look at the content , and in some cases , remove content providers , even when it 's not entirely clear why they 're taking out one or the other application . " " it 's very important to publishers -lrb- that they -rrb- retain ownership of the content and can decide what can be published – according to the extent of the law , of course . " earlier this year , apple " cleaned up " its app store , removing 5,000 " dirty " apps .
the german newspaper bild was affected , which is known for its flashy and fleshy front-page photos .
the vdz criticized apple 's behavior as " unfair , arbitrary , and damaging to business . " shifting their core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from newsstand to pet supplies , diversification is the key to successful e-business however publishers will work with third parties in the future , one thing is certain : selling the printed or virtual page alone will not suffice .
over the past 15 years , major german newspaper publishers have been shifting away from their core business of printing papers and reinventing themselves as media production companies . but the majority of newspaper publishing houses in germany are small or mid-sized - local or regional operations - each with its own distinct style .
" that 's what gives the german newspaper industry its charm and diversity , " said pasquay . " you 're not talking about just two or three different business strategies , but rather 200 or 300 industry-wide . " diversification is essential for magazine publishers as well , says von reibnitz : " i think the publishers are very innovative in testing new business models and expanding into completely new areas of business , which in some cases do n't have much to do with publishing anymore . " von reibnitz points to the axel springer publishing house , whose digital endeavors , including classified ads , now account for 20 percent of its total sales . meanwhile , around 50 percent of revenue at magazine publisher hubert burda 's digital subsidiary are transaction-based thanks to its stakes in an online pet supply store and other e-commerce platforms including xing , a european social networking site for professionals .
similarly , the stuttgart-based holtzbrinck now owns studivz , the german rival of facebook . as german publishers develop new business models for digital frontier markets , the zeitung business looks set to change forever . author : brian louis ramirez editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

the firm awaits the results as us president barack obama visits the area . oil giant bp puts its chances of blocking the seabed leak that has gushed oil into the gulf of mexico for the past three weeks at about 60 to 70 percent .
" we have wrestled it to the ground , but we have n't put a bullet in its head yet , " bp ceo tony hayward told news agency reuters while inspecting the spill site by helicopter .
hayward said the company would know if its " top kill " operation had worked within 48 hours , but that there were already some signs of success .
the process involves the injection of thousands of barrels of mud into the well to plug the leak , which has surpassed the 1989 exxon valdez disaster as the worst oil spill in us history .

the president said a team of government scientists was looking at contingency plans in case the bp effort failed .
on his visit , obama inspected oil-trapping booms at a beach in port fourchon , one of the areas most affected by oil from the spill being washed ashore .
spain , the netherlands and the european union have offered equipment to help the united states with the clean-up .
the european commission said that it had received a request from the us coast guard to help provide skimmers to help recover oil. rc / afp / ap / reuters editor : andrew bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .

from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .

from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .

there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .
there are no prizes at theater of the world , since the festival does n't seek to foster competition among participants .
instead , the focus is on the exchange and presentation of different perspectives .
also , performance spaces are n't limited to classical theater venues .
they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .

but on june 5 , the singing wo n't be about sports .

around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .
festival director frie leysen from belgium travelled across the globe to select this year 's artists .
there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .
there are no prizes at theater of the world , since the festival does n't seek to foster competition among participants .
instead , the focus is on the exchange and presentation of different perspectives .
also , performance spaces are n't limited to classical theater venues .
they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .
that may strike german soccer fans , who are likely to burst into a verse of a team anthem , as nothing unusual .
but on june 5 , the singing wo n't be about sports .
instead , gelsenkirchen 's stadium will house an enormous choir concert .
around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .
the concert marks the conclusion of a special musical weekend in the ruhr region . ! sing is the name of the project that serves as one of the high points of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
the goal is that singers will keep going from morning until night and fill the area with music .
at 12:10 on june 5 , church bells will pick up the tune of herbert groenemeyer 's " komm zur ruhr " -lrb- " come to the ruhr " -rrb- simultaneously in all of the ruhr region 's cities .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .
festival director frie leysen from belgium travelled across the globe to select this year 's artists .
there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .
there are no prizes at theater of the world , since the festival does n't seek to foster competition among participants .
instead , the focus is on the exchange and presentation of different perspectives .
also , performance spaces are n't limited to classical theater venues .
they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .
that may strike german soccer fans , who are likely to burst into a verse of a team anthem , as nothing unusual .
but on june 5 , the singing wo n't be about sports .
instead , gelsenkirchen 's stadium will house an enormous choir concert .
around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .
the concert marks the conclusion of a special musical weekend in the ruhr region . ! sing is the name of the project that serves as one of the high points of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
the goal is that singers will keep going from morning until night and fill the area with music .
at 12:10 on june 5 , church bells will pick up the tune of herbert groenemeyer 's " komm zur ruhr " -lrb- " come to the ruhr " -rrb- simultaneously in all of the ruhr region 's cities .

schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .

typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .

big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .

each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .

alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .

they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .
that may strike german soccer fans , who are likely to burst into a verse of a team anthem , as nothing unusual .

around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .

now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .

" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .

the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 28.05.2010 cosmopolitan berliners prefer english , except in the theater großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a decade ago the sound of english in central berlin still had a slight scent of the exotic about it , these days its flat vowels can be heard on pretty much any street corner - but less so in cinemas and theaters . call it european , call it progress or call it money saved on a german phrasebook - it 's a contemporary berlin truth that you can get by on english .
whereas once upon a time buying salami or ordering coffee in anything but perfect -lrb- and suitably gruff sounding -rrb- german would have elicited horrified exclamations of " wie bitte ? " , bi-lingual employees have now become a feature of the city 's growing service industry .
and they are n't the only ones afraid to step outside the german language fold .
everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .
it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .
and who can blame them ?
imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .
and even if they did , there is a belief that germans - including those intent on sending their children to bi-lingual schools - would not come to watch .
because what they really want from english is to understand the lingo of international media , technology , fashion and business .
and that means they are quite content to listen to the bard , if they listen at all , in translation . so for the time being , the choice of original cinema and theater in berlin is likely to remain restricted .
but perhaps when all those infants currently taking lessons in baa baa black sheep have made it through school , they will inject a touch more linguistic variety onto the screens and stages of the german capital . tamsin walker enjoys film and theater in both english and german in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 28.05.2010 can turkey save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is currently the fastest growing economy in europe with the european economy floundering , turkey - which underwent its own crisis in 2001 - has become a model of stability , boasting robust growth and a secure banking system .
now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

now apple appears poised to take command of the e-reader market .
is the device a godsend for consumers , or the damnation of the publishing industry ? the modern german word for newspaper , zeitung , originally referred to a tiding , or a piece of news , that was spread verbally in the middle ages .
it was only when those news snippets were printed on paper that the word 's meaning shifted to refer to the medium itself . but now the newspaper 's 400-year history is at a crossroads .
like other classic media , the newspaper and magazine industries are being forced to redefine themselves in the digital age - and in the wake of economic tumult . struggling with stagnation germany is the largest newspaper market in europe and the fifth largest in the world .
20 million daily newspapers are sold across the nation every day , with another 5 million weeklies and weekend editions on top of that . but the news publishing sector is struggling .
sales and subscriptions are declining , and the economic downturn has forced many companies to slash their advertising budgets .
advertising income currently accounts for about half of a newspaper 's revenue - just one decade ago it financed two-thirds of a publisher 's operation . " over the course of 2009 , the advertising market in regional daily newspapers dwindled by 12.1 percent with a similar decline in advertising-related sales , " anja pasquay of the bdvz , the federation of german newspaper publishers , told deutsche welle . if the economy does n't take an upswing soon , pasquay warns , publishers can expect to see households canceling their newspaper subscriptions or sharing them with others . the good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 400 years , the newspaper is set to change in a big way but there is hope on the horizon .
the arrival of e-readers such as amazon 's kindle , the sony ereader , and apple 's ipad is " good news for publishers , " according to the vdz , germany 's largest trade association of magazine publishers .
creating digital content for e-readers is one way for publishers to boost business . " e-publishing can be a real game-changer for publishers looking to tap into new sources of revenue from content , reach new target groups , and attract new advertisers , " alexander von reibnitz , the vdz 's director of digital media and new markets , told deutsche welle . e-readers with mobile internet capability can even transmit data about the user 's location and online behavior , helping publishers and advertisers provide content tailored to the user . the bad news but having electronics manufacturers join the publishing game has its downsides : apple could take as much as a 30 percent chunk of the profit pie , according to some estimates .
the company already eats up 10 to 15 percent of every us $ 0.99 cent music download , which is hard enough for music labels to swallow . " publishers need to control the distribution platforms and not merely serve as content providers to fully reap the fruits of this new business area , " von reibnitz said . publishers rely heavily upon knowing their readership .
but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .
news corporation , conde nast , hearst corporation , meredith , and time inc. set up next issue media as a platform to sell and distribute content directly to consumers .
germany 's gruner + jahr recently announced a similar initiative . bildunterschrift : e-readers can send your friends messages such as " i 'm busy reading , so leave me alone " good deal , or rotten apple ? another potential problem involves the freedom of press , von reibnitz says : " apple tends to take a close look at the content , and in some cases , remove content providers , even when it 's not entirely clear why they 're taking out one or the other application . " " it 's very important to publishers -lrb- that they -rrb- retain ownership of the content and can decide what can be published – according to the extent of the law , of course . " earlier this year , apple " cleaned up " its app store , removing 5,000 " dirty " apps .
the german newspaper bild was affected , which is known for its flashy and fleshy front-page photos .
the vdz criticized apple 's behavior as " unfair , arbitrary , and damaging to business . " shifting their core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from newsstand to pet supplies , diversification is the key to successful e-business however publishers will work with third parties in the future , one thing is certain : selling the printed or virtual page alone will not suffice .
over the past 15 years , major german newspaper publishers have been shifting away from their core business of printing papers and reinventing themselves as media production companies . but the majority of newspaper publishing houses in germany are small or mid-sized - local or regional operations - each with its own distinct style .
" that 's what gives the german newspaper industry its charm and diversity , " said pasquay . " you 're not talking about just two or three different business strategies , but rather 200 or 300 industry-wide . " diversification is essential for magazine publishers as well , says von reibnitz : " i think the publishers are very innovative in testing new business models and expanding into completely new areas of business , which in some cases do n't have much to do with publishing anymore . " von reibnitz points to the axel springer publishing house , whose digital endeavors , including classified ads , now account for 20 percent of its total sales . meanwhile , around 50 percent of revenue at magazine publisher hubert burda 's digital subsidiary are transaction-based thanks to its stakes in an online pet supply store and other e-commerce platforms including xing , a european social networking site for professionals .

now apple appears poised to take command of the e-reader market .
is the device a godsend for consumers , or the damnation of the publishing industry ? the modern german word for newspaper , zeitung , originally referred to a tiding , or a piece of news , that was spread verbally in the middle ages .
it was only when those news snippets were printed on paper that the word 's meaning shifted to refer to the medium itself . but now the newspaper 's 400-year history is at a crossroads .
like other classic media , the newspaper and magazine industries are being forced to redefine themselves in the digital age - and in the wake of economic tumult . struggling with stagnation germany is the largest newspaper market in europe and the fifth largest in the world .
20 million daily newspapers are sold across the nation every day , with another 5 million weeklies and weekend editions on top of that . but the news publishing sector is struggling .
sales and subscriptions are declining , and the economic downturn has forced many companies to slash their advertising budgets .
advertising income currently accounts for about half of a newspaper 's revenue - just one decade ago it financed two-thirds of a publisher 's operation . " over the course of 2009 , the advertising market in regional daily newspapers dwindled by 12.1 percent with a similar decline in advertising-related sales , " anja pasquay of the bdvz , the federation of german newspaper publishers , told deutsche welle . if the economy does n't take an upswing soon , pasquay warns , publishers can expect to see households canceling their newspaper subscriptions or sharing them with others . the good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 400 years , the newspaper is set to change in a big way but there is hope on the horizon .
the arrival of e-readers such as amazon 's kindle , the sony ereader , and apple 's ipad is " good news for publishers , " according to the vdz , germany 's largest trade association of magazine publishers .
creating digital content for e-readers is one way for publishers to boost business . " e-publishing can be a real game-changer for publishers looking to tap into new sources of revenue from content , reach new target groups , and attract new advertisers , " alexander von reibnitz , the vdz 's director of digital media and new markets , told deutsche welle . e-readers with mobile internet capability can even transmit data about the user 's location and online behavior , helping publishers and advertisers provide content tailored to the user . the bad news but having electronics manufacturers join the publishing game has its downsides : apple could take as much as a 30 percent chunk of the profit pie , according to some estimates .
the company already eats up 10 to 15 percent of every us $ 0.99 cent music download , which is hard enough for music labels to swallow . " publishers need to control the distribution platforms and not merely serve as content providers to fully reap the fruits of this new business area , " von reibnitz said . publishers rely heavily upon knowing their readership .
but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .
news corporation , conde nast , hearst corporation , meredith , and time inc. set up next issue media as a platform to sell and distribute content directly to consumers .
germany 's gruner + jahr recently announced a similar initiative . bildunterschrift : e-readers can send your friends messages such as " i 'm busy reading , so leave me alone " good deal , or rotten apple ? another potential problem involves the freedom of press , von reibnitz says : " apple tends to take a close look at the content , and in some cases , remove content providers , even when it 's not entirely clear why they 're taking out one or the other application . " " it 's very important to publishers -lrb- that they -rrb- retain ownership of the content and can decide what can be published – according to the extent of the law , of course . " earlier this year , apple " cleaned up " its app store , removing 5,000 " dirty " apps .

over the past 15 years , major german newspaper publishers have been shifting away from their core business of printing papers and reinventing themselves as media production companies . but the majority of newspaper publishing houses in germany are small or mid-sized - local or regional operations - each with its own distinct style .

like other classic media , the newspaper and magazine industries are being forced to redefine themselves in the digital age - and in the wake of economic tumult . struggling with stagnation germany is the largest newspaper market in europe and the fifth largest in the world .
20 million daily newspapers are sold across the nation every day , with another 5 million weeklies and weekend editions on top of that . but the news publishing sector is struggling .
sales and subscriptions are declining , and the economic downturn has forced many companies to slash their advertising budgets .
advertising income currently accounts for about half of a newspaper 's revenue - just one decade ago it financed two-thirds of a publisher 's operation . " over the course of 2009 , the advertising market in regional daily newspapers dwindled by 12.1 percent with a similar decline in advertising-related sales , " anja pasquay of the bdvz , the federation of german newspaper publishers , told deutsche welle . if the economy does n't take an upswing soon , pasquay warns , publishers can expect to see households canceling their newspaper subscriptions or sharing them with others . the good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 400 years , the newspaper is set to change in a big way but there is hope on the horizon .
the arrival of e-readers such as amazon 's kindle , the sony ereader , and apple 's ipad is " good news for publishers , " according to the vdz , germany 's largest trade association of magazine publishers .
creating digital content for e-readers is one way for publishers to boost business . " e-publishing can be a real game-changer for publishers looking to tap into new sources of revenue from content , reach new target groups , and attract new advertisers , " alexander von reibnitz , the vdz 's director of digital media and new markets , told deutsche welle . e-readers with mobile internet capability can even transmit data about the user 's location and online behavior , helping publishers and advertisers provide content tailored to the user . the bad news but having electronics manufacturers join the publishing game has its downsides : apple could take as much as a 30 percent chunk of the profit pie , according to some estimates .
the company already eats up 10 to 15 percent of every us $ 0.99 cent music download , which is hard enough for music labels to swallow . " publishers need to control the distribution platforms and not merely serve as content providers to fully reap the fruits of this new business area , " von reibnitz said . publishers rely heavily upon knowing their readership .
but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .
news corporation , conde nast , hearst corporation , meredith , and time inc. set up next issue media as a platform to sell and distribute content directly to consumers .
germany 's gruner + jahr recently announced a similar initiative . bildunterschrift : e-readers can send your friends messages such as " i 'm busy reading , so leave me alone " good deal , or rotten apple ? another potential problem involves the freedom of press , von reibnitz says : " apple tends to take a close look at the content , and in some cases , remove content providers , even when it 's not entirely clear why they 're taking out one or the other application . " " it 's very important to publishers -lrb- that they -rrb- retain ownership of the content and can decide what can be published – according to the extent of the law , of course . " earlier this year , apple " cleaned up " its app store , removing 5,000 " dirty " apps .
the german newspaper bild was affected , which is known for its flashy and fleshy front-page photos .
the vdz criticized apple 's behavior as " unfair , arbitrary , and damaging to business . " shifting their core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from newsstand to pet supplies , diversification is the key to successful e-business however publishers will work with third parties in the future , one thing is certain : selling the printed or virtual page alone will not suffice .
over the past 15 years , major german newspaper publishers have been shifting away from their core business of printing papers and reinventing themselves as media production companies . but the majority of newspaper publishing houses in germany are small or mid-sized - local or regional operations - each with its own distinct style .
" that 's what gives the german newspaper industry its charm and diversity , " said pasquay . " you 're not talking about just two or three different business strategies , but rather 200 or 300 industry-wide . " diversification is essential for magazine publishers as well , says von reibnitz : " i think the publishers are very innovative in testing new business models and expanding into completely new areas of business , which in some cases do n't have much to do with publishing anymore . " von reibnitz points to the axel springer publishing house , whose digital endeavors , including classified ads , now account for 20 percent of its total sales . meanwhile , around 50 percent of revenue at magazine publisher hubert burda 's digital subsidiary are transaction-based thanks to its stakes in an online pet supply store and other e-commerce platforms including xing , a european social networking site for professionals .
similarly , the stuttgart-based holtzbrinck now owns studivz , the german rival of facebook . as german publishers develop new business models for digital frontier markets , the zeitung business looks set to change forever . author : brian louis ramirez editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .
festival director frie leysen from belgium travelled across the globe to select this year 's artists .
there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .
there are no prizes at theater of the world , since the festival does n't seek to foster competition among participants .
instead , the focus is on the exchange and presentation of different perspectives .
also , performance spaces are n't limited to classical theater venues .
they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .
that may strike german soccer fans , who are likely to burst into a verse of a team anthem , as nothing unusual .
but on june 5 , the singing wo n't be about sports .
instead , gelsenkirchen 's stadium will house an enormous choir concert .
around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .
the concert marks the conclusion of a special musical weekend in the ruhr region . ! sing is the name of the project that serves as one of the high points of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
the goal is that singers will keep going from morning until night and fill the area with music .
at 12:10 on june 5 , church bells will pick up the tune of herbert groenemeyer 's " komm zur ruhr " -lrb- " come to the ruhr " -rrb- simultaneously in all of the ruhr region 's cities .

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .

the draft comes in response to increased levels of violence directed at officers . germany 's interior ministers have made a move to create more protection for the country 's police , after deciding on friday to ask for tougher laws against all attacks on officers . " our policemen protect our freedom , our lives , and the property of all citizens and therefore require special protection against attacks , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere said at a press conference after the annual meeting in hamburg with the interior ministers of germany 's 16 federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public demonstrations are often the scene of violent attacks the ministers agreed to raise the maximum penalty from two to three years in prison , with instances of serious abuse - such as punching or kicking an officer - warranting a maximum sentence of five years . in response to the interior ministers ' conference , german justice minister sabine leuthhauser-schnarrenberger confirmed on friday that she would support the increased penalty , adding , however , that she was " not prepared to implement a minimum prison sentence on attacks against police officers . " ' scapegoats of the nation ' an interior ministry study released on wednesday showed that violence against police forces across germany had increased dramatically in the past five years . leading german criminologist christian pfeiffer told deutsche welle he could understand why german officers described themselves as " scapegoats of the german nation , " with cases of serious abuse against police having more than doubled between 2005 and 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german police refer to themselves as ' scapegoats of the nation ' of the over 22,000 officers polled , ninety percent said they had been threatened with violence while on duty in the past year .
thirty percent said they had been either punched or kicked by suspects resisting arrest . the study also indicated that violent attacks occurred most frequently when officers were called to restore order at demonstrations or to scenes of domestic violence . pfeiffer said in the case of domestic violence that this was a " double-edged sword . " " on the one hand , this shows a positive development , with more women alerting the authorities when in danger of abuse .
on the other hand , it also means that more officers are becoming the target of this violence , " pfeiffer said . biker gang ' peace accord ' ineffective the other major topic discussed by the ministers was a potential ban on the hell 's angels and bandidos motorcycle gangs . with a feud between the two groups reaching a highpoint earlier this year after a series of revenge killings - and the murder of a policeman in the state of rhineland-palatinate in march - several of the country 's interior ministries had already suggested a germany-wide ban , which was confirmed on friday after the ministers ' meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is looking to outlaw violent biker gangs this comes after leaders of the two gangs met in hanover earlier in the week to announce an official end to rivalry as part of an accord to work towards a " peaceful coexistence . " a spokesman for germany 's police union , however , labeled the non-aggression pact " all smoke and mirrors to camouflage -lsb- the groups ' -rsb- rowdyism and criminal machinations , " reflecting the german authorities ' incredulous reception of the announced peace deal . although consensus has been reached among german state officials to outlaw the hell 's angels and bandidos , however , doubts remain whether such an all-encompassing ban would be legal . author : gabriel borrud editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

local municipalities and military advocates have criticized the controversial plan . in an effort to slash defense spending , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said that there is no way around the closing of the german military bases .
" in the end … there will be base closures , " guttenberg said friday on german public television .
" we can either ignore this for the next few years , and then give the concerned parties a terrible shock when the moment comes .
or we can give them a chance to at least mentally prepare for this now , " the christian democrat politician said .
paradigm shift guttenberg has announced radical reductions in the face of federal budget constraints .
in a speech on wednesday , he said he hoped to save 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- a year in the german army , but the specific details have n't been worked out .
in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung , the head of the armed forces association ulrich kirsch criticized the proposals , calling the savings measures a " paradigm shift " with profound consequences for the bundeswehr .
" minister zu guttenberg said that the attractiveness of the armed forces should not suffer under the savings measures .
i 'm very skeptical about that , " kirsch told the station mdr info .
loss of revenue a closure of military barracks would also mean a severe blow to the communities that house the troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says smaller bases should be closed to save money " we expect that this decision will be made with us , " the chief executive of the german association of cities and municipalities , gerd landsberg , told the financial times germany .
" if the minister says the the armed forces should be more firmly anchored in society , then they can not be withdrawn from the area , " landsberg added .
in his interview with ard , guttenberg stressed that base closures stood " at the bottom of the list " of austerity measures .
the first steps would be cuts to staffing and equipment. smh / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 28.05.2010 cosmopolitan berliners prefer english , except in the theater großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while a decade ago the sound of english in central berlin still had a slight scent of the exotic about it , these days its flat vowels can be heard on pretty much any street corner - but less so in cinemas and theaters . call it european , call it progress or call it money saved on a german phrasebook - it 's a contemporary berlin truth that you can get by on english .
whereas once upon a time buying salami or ordering coffee in anything but perfect -lrb- and suitably gruff sounding -rrb- german would have elicited horrified exclamations of " wie bitte ? " , bi-lingual employees have now become a feature of the city 's growing service industry .
and they are n't the only ones afraid to step outside the german language fold .
everywhere i go these days i see flyers advertising clubs and courses in everything from yoga and music to theater , reflexology and summer camp - all in english .
they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .
except it 's not .
it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .
and who can blame them ?
imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .
in short , of the 90 or so cinemas in the city , very few run flicks in the language in which they were shot .
good news for the dubbing industry , less so for purists .
some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .
and even if they did , there is a belief that germans - including those intent on sending their children to bi-lingual schools - would not come to watch .
because what they really want from english is to understand the lingo of international media , technology , fashion and business .
and that means they are quite content to listen to the bard , if they listen at all , in translation . so for the time being , the choice of original cinema and theater in berlin is likely to remain restricted .
but perhaps when all those infants currently taking lessons in baa baa black sheep have made it through school , they will inject a touch more linguistic variety onto the screens and stages of the german capital . tamsin walker enjoys film and theater in both english and german in berlin .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .

french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they cater in part to the 30,000 native english-speaking resident here , but also to linguistically ambitious locals .
and of them , there are many , as a trip around the city 's education circuit will prove .
last week , when standing at the counter of a not so cosmopolitan shop , i saw three leaflets laid out side by side .
one was for an english primary school , another was offering kids englische nachhilfe or extra tutoring , and the third promised to verse german-born toddlers in the foreign lingo before they have even managed to wrap their tongues around their own .
i asked the shop owner if he was an anglophile , but he assured me he was just being a good neighbor by letting local businesses advertise on his premises . he said the fact that the flyers were all english-related was purely coincidental .

it is very much a reflection of the desire among german parents to fit their kids for a global world in which english is indisputably the lingua franca .

imbalanced linguistic evolution what strikes me , however , is that in and amongst this sea of englische schools , nurseries , clubs , shops and tearooms , the city 's listings for original language theater and cinema are , relatively speaking , rather scant . that decade ago when british banter on the u-bahn was not as common as muck , the babylon , odeon , hackescherhoefe and central original version cinemas had all been up and running for years .
and the eight screen sony center movie theater had also just opened for business .
while all said establishments are still on the map , they have not yet been joined by any serious competition .

some independent minds have tried to meet a fraction of the demand for non-synchronized viewing by starting up film nights .
one such venture was launched by saint george 's second-hand english bookshop in the prenzlauerberg neighborhood .
every tuesday evening for four years , cinephiles could come along , have a glass of wine and sit among the books watching two original language pictures for just a few euros .
a rights issue eventually forced them to strike the event from the weekly listings , but while it was running , its success was testimony to unfulfilled potential .
mono-lingual thesps the story is similar on the stage .
the only place punters are guaranteed original language performances is the english theatre berlin , which celebrates its twentieth birthday this year . since its inception , the etb has seen audience numbers grow but has never felt the cold winds of serious competition .
lamentably .
" it would be good for us if there were a stronger basis of english language theaters in the city , " founder and managing director bern hoffmeister told me .
but that trend does n't seem to be waiting in the wings .
theaters say they ca n't suddenly put on shakespeare in original because it would be unreasonable - and the results probably unprofessional - to expect their indigenous ensembles to perform in a foreign language .
and even if they did , there is a belief that germans - including those intent on sending their children to bi-lingual schools - would not come to watch .
because what they really want from english is to understand the lingo of international media , technology , fashion and business .
and that means they are quite content to listen to the bard , if they listen at all , in translation . so for the time being , the choice of original cinema and theater in berlin is likely to remain restricted .
but perhaps when all those infants currently taking lessons in baa baa black sheep have made it through school , they will inject a touch more linguistic variety onto the screens and stages of the german capital . tamsin walker enjoys film and theater in both english and german in berlin .

now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .
the debt crisis in greece could even exacerbate lending conditions and thus jeopardize any signs of an upswing in the economy .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .
bildunterschrift : art basel guests can see " the nose ensemble costume maquettes " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- by william kentridge and greta goiris c / o pop in cologne it 's tough to compete with berlin - and the city of cologne knows this all too well ; its music festival popkomm migrated to germany 's capital in 2003 .
but cologne snapped back , and compensated by establishing the " c / o pop " festival the very next year. c / o pop focuses on indie , alternative and electro music as well other aspects of club culture .
from june 23-28 , there will be numerous concerts at venues across cologne .
big names in the german music scene like dj shantel from frankfurt and the band die sterne -lrb- " the stars " -rrb- will be there , alongside plenty of local bands .
last year 's festival drew around 30,000 attendees. c / o pop is about more than just concerts , though .
it 's a platform for exchange and discussion .
one project , " europareise , " invites festival managers from other countries to present the pop culture in their native countries .
another event is the " c 'n'b convention , " which brings together those working in the creative and music industry - label managers , set designers , etc . - to discuss various aspects of pop culture in the internet era .
bildunterschrift : the band timid tiger from cologne is one of many acts at this year 's c / o pop literature days in klagenfurt in june , the city of klagenfurt will once again become a meeting point for the german-speaking literary scene .
from june 24-26 , 14 selected authors will take part in a juried reading .
each author has 25 minutes to read a passage .
then , the seven-member jury discusses the text , while the author listens but is not permitted to comment .
the event is public and televised .
three days of readings decide who will win the ingeborg bachmann prize , one of the most significant literary prizes in the german-speaking world .
alongside the honor and media attention associated with the award , the winner receives 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,835 -rrb- .
the event in klagenfurt was organized at the end of the 70s and modelled after the group 47 - an association of post-war authors who read to each other and offered criticism of one another 's work .
author ingeborg bachmann , who was born in klagenfurt , also belonged to group 47 .
the group awarded bachmann its prize in 1953 as a young author , helping to establish her literary reputation .
now , the organizers of the ingeborg bachmann prize hope to do the same for other authors .
munich film festival after a false start in the 1970s , germany 's second-largest film festival was launched in 1983 in munich .
eberhard hauff , a film director active in many aspects of the industry , took over the festival in the early 80s and did away with the festival 's glitzy approach prior to his tenure .
from june 25 to july 3 , around 200 german films will be premiered , often in the presence of their directors .
in contrast to the berlinale , the munich film festival does not feature a central competition , but prizes will nevertheless be awarded , including a prize for young german filmmakers .
it carries an award of 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 74,000 -rrb- .
this year 's festival will focus on india .
following four decades of " bollywood " productions , new kinds of films are gaining popularity in india , particularly among the western-oriented middle class .
" theater of the world " in germany 's ruhr valley the ruhr valley in western germany has banded together as one of this year 's european capitals of culture and offers an extensive cultural program .
an international theater festival called the " theater of the world " is one of the events taking place there this summer .
from june 30 to july 17 , 32 productions from africa , asia , europe and latin america will be presented .
festival director frie leysen from belgium travelled across the globe to select this year 's artists .
there is no given theme , but the artists are encouraged to bring something they would like to share to the stage .
many aspects of the productions are created specifically for the event , and this year features eleven premieres including dance , music and performance pieces .
there are no prizes at theater of the world , since the festival does n't seek to foster competition among participants .
instead , the focus is on the exchange and presentation of different perspectives .
also , performance spaces are n't limited to classical theater venues .
they include industrial buildings , a factory owner 's villa , and other parts of the region 's largest city , essen .
bildunterschrift : tokyo performing group faifai will present their work " my name is i love you " singing at the soccer stadium the soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen , germany will burst into song on june 5 .
that may strike german soccer fans , who are likely to burst into a verse of a team anthem , as nothing unusual .
but on june 5 , the singing wo n't be about sports .
instead , gelsenkirchen 's stadium will house an enormous choir concert .
around 8,000 singers will take to the field to lend their voices to folk , opera and pop songs .
singers like pop sensation bobby mcferrin and opera diva vesselina kasarova will join them .
the audience is expressly invited to join in , and whoever wants some practice can get a copy of the song book beforehand .
the concert marks the conclusion of a special musical weekend in the ruhr region . ! sing is the name of the project that serves as one of the high points of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
the goal is that singers will keep going from morning until night and fill the area with music .
at 12:10 on june 5 , church bells will pick up the tune of herbert groenemeyer 's " komm zur ruhr " -lrb- " come to the ruhr " -rrb- simultaneously in all of the ruhr region 's cities .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .

french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . robert schumann 's 200th birthday robert schumann is among germany 's most important composers and even achieved international success during his lifetime in places like london and new york .
schumann 's hometown of zwickau has long celebrated the composer and established the schumann festival in 1847 .
robert and wife clara schumann performed at the first festival .
he conducted his symphony in c major , while she appeared as a soloist during his piano concert .
robert schumann died nine years later , but the schumann festival has endured .
it took place at irregular intervals following schumann 's death but has been an annual event ever since 1960 .
zwickau is going to special lengths this year in light of it being the 200th anniversary of schumann 's birth on june 8 .
visitors can expect a full program of readings , concerts , and opera and ballet performances .
organizers anticipate schumann enthusiasts to visit from throughout germany as well as the usa and japan .
the tchaikovsky society in moscow welcomed the festival with an acknowledgement of how greatly schumann influenced the russian composer .
bildunterschrift : " sound is the finest element that makes up our spirit , " said robert schumann rescued treasures of afghanistan the remainder of afghanistan 's artistic treasures are now travelling the world because their home is too unsafe .
in 2001 , the taliban stormed kabul 's national museum and destroyed most of the collection .
just a few objects were rescued swiftly and hidden .
the museum remained silent about them until 2003 , when it announced that several pieces were preserved in deposit boxes at kabul 's central bank .
the items were transferred out of afghanistan to the musee guimet in paris , where they were first restored and eventually presented to the public for the first time at the end of 2006 .
since then , the exhibition has been on the road .
after paris came turin , amsterdam , the usa , canada and now bonn , germany , where they will be on view until october 3 .
the next stop is undecided , but returning to afghanistan remains out of the question for now .
bildunterschrift : this work in ivory dates to the first century a.d. art in basel and berlin for the 41st time , art basel -lrb- june 16-20 -rrb- will bring art lovers from around the globe to switzerland .
typically , the event draws a big crowd with more than 60,000 visitors last year .
the basel art fair is among the most important in the world , even if its home city may strike some as an unlikely location .
after all , basel is a small city with a central district dating to the middle ages and a mere 190,000 inhabitants .
gallery owner and collector ernst beyeler played a major role in establishing art basel in the city .
he was one of art basel 's founders and drew upon his international contacts in the art world to help set the festival in good stead .
in contrast to the renowned art fair in cologne , which originally allowed only german galleries to present work , art basel has long been internationally oriented .
many art experts travelling to basel will add a stop in berlin to their trip , where the sixth berlin biennale for contemporary art begins on june 10 .
the biennale has quickly carved out a niche in the international art market .
through august 8 , international artists will focus on contemporary society under the curatorship of kathrin rhomberg .
the biennale 's title is " was draussen wartet " or " what waits outside " .

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .
the debt crisis in greece could even exacerbate lending conditions and thus jeopardize any signs of an upswing in the economy .

now apple appears poised to take command of the e-reader market .
is the device a godsend for consumers , or the damnation of the publishing industry ? the modern german word for newspaper , zeitung , originally referred to a tiding , or a piece of news , that was spread verbally in the middle ages .
it was only when those news snippets were printed on paper that the word 's meaning shifted to refer to the medium itself . but now the newspaper 's 400-year history is at a crossroads .
like other classic media , the newspaper and magazine industries are being forced to redefine themselves in the digital age - and in the wake of economic tumult . struggling with stagnation germany is the largest newspaper market in europe and the fifth largest in the world .
20 million daily newspapers are sold across the nation every day , with another 5 million weeklies and weekend editions on top of that . but the news publishing sector is struggling .
sales and subscriptions are declining , and the economic downturn has forced many companies to slash their advertising budgets .
advertising income currently accounts for about half of a newspaper 's revenue - just one decade ago it financed two-thirds of a publisher 's operation . " over the course of 2009 , the advertising market in regional daily newspapers dwindled by 12.1 percent with a similar decline in advertising-related sales , " anja pasquay of the bdvz , the federation of german newspaper publishers , told deutsche welle . if the economy does n't take an upswing soon , pasquay warns , publishers can expect to see households canceling their newspaper subscriptions or sharing them with others . the good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 400 years , the newspaper is set to change in a big way but there is hope on the horizon .
the arrival of e-readers such as amazon 's kindle , the sony ereader , and apple 's ipad is " good news for publishers , " according to the vdz , germany 's largest trade association of magazine publishers .
creating digital content for e-readers is one way for publishers to boost business . " e-publishing can be a real game-changer for publishers looking to tap into new sources of revenue from content , reach new target groups , and attract new advertisers , " alexander von reibnitz , the vdz 's director of digital media and new markets , told deutsche welle . e-readers with mobile internet capability can even transmit data about the user 's location and online behavior , helping publishers and advertisers provide content tailored to the user . the bad news but having electronics manufacturers join the publishing game has its downsides : apple could take as much as a 30 percent chunk of the profit pie , according to some estimates .
the company already eats up 10 to 15 percent of every us $ 0.99 cent music download , which is hard enough for music labels to swallow . " publishers need to control the distribution platforms and not merely serve as content providers to fully reap the fruits of this new business area , " von reibnitz said . publishers rely heavily upon knowing their readership .
but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .

now apple appears poised to take command of the e-reader market .
is the device a godsend for consumers , or the damnation of the publishing industry ? the modern german word for newspaper , zeitung , originally referred to a tiding , or a piece of news , that was spread verbally in the middle ages .
it was only when those news snippets were printed on paper that the word 's meaning shifted to refer to the medium itself . but now the newspaper 's 400-year history is at a crossroads .
like other classic media , the newspaper and magazine industries are being forced to redefine themselves in the digital age - and in the wake of economic tumult . struggling with stagnation germany is the largest newspaper market in europe and the fifth largest in the world .
20 million daily newspapers are sold across the nation every day , with another 5 million weeklies and weekend editions on top of that . but the news publishing sector is struggling .
sales and subscriptions are declining , and the economic downturn has forced many companies to slash their advertising budgets .
advertising income currently accounts for about half of a newspaper 's revenue - just one decade ago it financed two-thirds of a publisher 's operation . " over the course of 2009 , the advertising market in regional daily newspapers dwindled by 12.1 percent with a similar decline in advertising-related sales , " anja pasquay of the bdvz , the federation of german newspaper publishers , told deutsche welle . if the economy does n't take an upswing soon , pasquay warns , publishers can expect to see households canceling their newspaper subscriptions or sharing them with others . the good news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 400 years , the newspaper is set to change in a big way but there is hope on the horizon .
the arrival of e-readers such as amazon 's kindle , the sony ereader , and apple 's ipad is " good news for publishers , " according to the vdz , germany 's largest trade association of magazine publishers .
creating digital content for e-readers is one way for publishers to boost business . " e-publishing can be a real game-changer for publishers looking to tap into new sources of revenue from content , reach new target groups , and attract new advertisers , " alexander von reibnitz , the vdz 's director of digital media and new markets , told deutsche welle . e-readers with mobile internet capability can even transmit data about the user 's location and online behavior , helping publishers and advertisers provide content tailored to the user . the bad news but having electronics manufacturers join the publishing game has its downsides : apple could take as much as a 30 percent chunk of the profit pie , according to some estimates .
the company already eats up 10 to 15 percent of every us $ 0.99 cent music download , which is hard enough for music labels to swallow . " publishers need to control the distribution platforms and not merely serve as content providers to fully reap the fruits of this new business area , " von reibnitz said . publishers rely heavily upon knowing their readership .
but as third-party platforms such as amazon 's kindle store or apple 's ibookstore position themselves between publishers and consumers , the direct relationship between producers and readers is ceasing to exist . five major publishers in the us have joined forces to sidestep possible price controls .
news corporation , conde nast , hearst corporation , meredith , and time inc. set up next issue media as a platform to sell and distribute content directly to consumers .
germany 's gruner + jahr recently announced a similar initiative . bildunterschrift : e-readers can send your friends messages such as " i 'm busy reading , so leave me alone " good deal , or rotten apple ? another potential problem involves the freedom of press , von reibnitz says : " apple tends to take a close look at the content , and in some cases , remove content providers , even when it 's not entirely clear why they 're taking out one or the other application . " " it 's very important to publishers -lrb- that they -rrb- retain ownership of the content and can decide what can be published – according to the extent of the law , of course . " earlier this year , apple " cleaned up " its app store , removing 5,000 " dirty " apps .
the german newspaper bild was affected , which is known for its flashy and fleshy front-page photos .
the vdz criticized apple 's behavior as " unfair , arbitrary , and damaging to business . " shifting their core bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from newsstand to pet supplies , diversification is the key to successful e-business however publishers will work with third parties in the future , one thing is certain : selling the printed or virtual page alone will not suffice .
over the past 15 years , major german newspaper publishers have been shifting away from their core business of printing papers and reinventing themselves as media production companies . but the majority of newspaper publishing houses in germany are small or mid-sized - local or regional operations - each with its own distinct style .
" that 's what gives the german newspaper industry its charm and diversity , " said pasquay . " you 're not talking about just two or three different business strategies , but rather 200 or 300 industry-wide . " diversification is essential for magazine publishers as well , says von reibnitz : " i think the publishers are very innovative in testing new business models and expanding into completely new areas of business , which in some cases do n't have much to do with publishing anymore . " von reibnitz points to the axel springer publishing house , whose digital endeavors , including classified ads , now account for 20 percent of its total sales . meanwhile , around 50 percent of revenue at magazine publisher hubert burda 's digital subsidiary are transaction-based thanks to its stakes in an online pet supply store and other e-commerce platforms including xing , a european social networking site for professionals .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to help companies access funding , the state-owned development bank kfw is setting up a fund of 300 million euros initially , which could then be boosted to 500 million euros at a later stage .
" we 're in the advanced stages of deliberations on this , " said ulrich schroeder , head of kfw .
schroeder added that kfw is in talks with several banks to contribute to such a fund .
media reports suggest commerzbank may be one of the banks .
germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , has already set up a similar fund .
chief executive josef ackermann said at the company 's annual general meeting that he is looking for investors to be able to boost funding for smes .
lack of equity the lack of adequate equity is one of the main problems of germany 's mittelstand .
according to a recent kfw survey , over 61 percent of companies with sales of up to 50 million euros had problems securing any kind of financing during 2009 .
another survey , by the ifo economic institute , paints a slightly more upbeat picture .
among the 4,000 firms polled during may , 35.6 percent complained about not receiving adequate loans , the lowest percentage in 18 months .
" that 's a good sign for the economy , " ifo chief economist klaus abberger said , but conceded that it is too early to speak of a real recovery .
in fact , kfw 's schroeder does not expect an improvement any time soon .
the debt crisis in greece could even exacerbate lending conditions and thus jeopardize any signs of an upswing in the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.05.2010 dutch groups want to expand assisted suicide rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you no longer want to live , do you have an automatic right to die ?
assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .
" they are part of our society , too . " author : stephanie siek editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

assisted suicide is tolerated in the netherlands , under certain conditions .
but right-to-die advocates in the country think the law should be expanded to cover healthy elderly people who consider their lives " complete . " the netherlands is one of a handful of countries where very ill people have the right to medical assistance to kill themselves if they choose to do so .
but right-to-die advocates say that right should also be extended to those who want to end their lives before the onset of illness and incapacitation that comes with age . a petition asking the dutch parliament to debate whether all people over 70 have a right to suicide gathered more than 117,000 signatures . the petition 's sponsors hope to put it on the parliamentary agenda after elections in june . assisted suicide is technically against the law in the netherlands , but there are exceptions .
doctors who assist with suicides can not be punished if they can prove they adhered to strict medical and ethical guidelines , and if the patient was suffering from an " unbearable and hopeless " illness and had explicitly and repeatedly requested the doctor 's assistance in dying . a ' completed ' life but the dutch organization de einder , or horizon , and other right-to-die advocacy groups say that older individuals should be able to determine when they want to end their own lives , even if they are not suffering from serious illness .
instead , they should have the option of committing suicide at a point where they consider their lives " complete . " horizon 's chairman , enno nuy , admits that this can be difficult to define . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say ending one 's own life should be a right for all " mostly it concerns people who are older , have no pleasant perspectives or expectations left , who have no friends or relatives , and who are facing alzheimer 's or dementia , " nuy told deutsche welle . nuy said this is different than simply being depressed , and that when horizon 's counselors talk with people considering ending their lives , the say that their wishes would not change by altering something in their lives , such as giving them a new medication or a new living situation . " -lrb- they feel that -rrb- there is no reasonable expectation things will improve , " he said . right to die-netherlands , known by the dutch acronym nvve , is another group which supported the petition . in an informational pamphlet available on the group 's website , director petra de jong said " the elderly should be allowed to make a well thought-through choice at the end of their lives , and that such a choice will be entirely up to them . " " all this is in the hope that it will contribute to an open debate , that will lead to the realization of a solution for this difficult and highly emotional problem for people who consider their life completed and , therefore , prefer death over life , " de jong said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assisted suicide means access to medication that ends life without discomfort the pamphlet says that people who feel this way are suffering from a combination of circumstances : nonthreatening ailments , the loss of family and friends , loss of independence , physical decline including loss of sight , hearing or control of bodily fluids , or a fear that they will become a burden to others . burdens of living versus dying erik borgman , a professor of religious studies at the university of tilburg in the netherlands , said the idea of allowing otherwise healthy people to end their own lives is going a step too far .
he summarized the argument in favor of this type of assisted suicide as " why go on living , just because i 'm alive now ? " " but the problem is that you can not turn the argument around - you can not say , ' well , why should i be living ? ' and then when you do not have a good answer to that , then the conclusion should n't be , ' well , then i might just as well be dead , " ' borgman told deutsche welle . borgman said society should be more concerned with convincing people that they have value even if they are old , lonely , infirm , or unable to take care of themselves . " we should have a system of care in general that shows people that they are not a burden on society when they need care and when they are dependent on other people , " he said .

now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 28.05.2010 can turkey save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is currently the fastest growing economy in europe with the european economy floundering , turkey - which underwent its own crisis in 2001 - has become a model of stability , boasting robust growth and a secure banking system .
now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 28.05.2010 jamming of dw is part of ethiopia 's campaign against press freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dw reporter interviews an election helper in ethiopia .
coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new guarantee comes as markets grow more sensitive about exposure to government debt . german nationalized bank hypo real estate has received an extra 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.3 billion -rrb- in public loan guarantees to protect it from renewed market turbulence .
the german government 's bank rescue fund soffin said on friday that it was extending its guarantee level to 103.5 billion euros because of " the current situation on financial markets . "
fund head hannes rehm said that the bank required the guarantees as it carried out a restructuring program .
any failure of that restructuring process " would have huge consequences for the german economy , " said rehm .
government bonds pose risk the bank , which specializes in property-lending and municipal financing , is at risk from potential losses on bonds it owns that were issued by troubled eurozone countries such as greece , spain , ireland and portugal .
the bank had around 39 billion euros in exposure to such " sovereign debt " at the end of march .
the worsening of the greek debt crisis and fears that similar problems would spread to other european economies have made bond exposure a sensitive issue on money markets .
hypo real estate , the most prominent german casualty of the financial crisis , ran into trouble in 2008 .
it was nationalized by the government the following year after successive loan guarantees and capital injections were provided by the state. rc / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 28.05.2010 can turkey save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is currently the fastest growing economy in europe with the european economy floundering , turkey - which underwent its own crisis in 2001 - has become a model of stability , boasting robust growth and a secure banking system .
now germany is seeking closer economic ties . the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- reported this week that the world 's market economies were recovering better from the global financial crisis than expected .
the overall prognosis in the oecd 's 31 member countries is now growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2011 .
this is a marked improvement on the dark days of last november when the oecd expected growth to dawdle at 1.9 percent in 2010 .
in the succinct words of the report , " the tendential growth dynamic is intact . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister rainer bruederle is in istanbul at the moment the tendential growth dynamic seems to be even stronger in turkey .
the european commission predicted a growth of 5 percent for turkey this year and 4.5 percent in 2011 - the best figures in europe .
and other factors show that turkey has shown the healthiest recovery signs of all the oecd countries : turkish minister-of-state ali babacan recently pointed out that his was the only oecd government that did not need to help its banks with state financing following the recent financial crisis .
this , it has to be said , is partly due to turkey 's own economic crisis of 2001 , which led the ankara government to impose what many consider the strictest market trading regulations in the world .
banks were barred from high-risk investments , a precautionary measure that the government is currently blessing .
old partner , new interest germany , for its part , seems to be nurturing new interest in its old economic ally .
turkey was this year 's partner country at the major itb tourism trade fair in berlin , and german economy minister rainer bruederle is currently on a trip to turkey with delegates of some 20 mid-sized german companies to help foster new relationships .
" i have high expectations of these talks , " bruederle said during his trip .
" there is still substantial unused potential in the infrastructure and energy sectors , as well as in industrial cooperation . "
christian dreger , head of the macroanalysis and forecasting department of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , agrees .
" it 's certainly true that turkey has not really been acknowledged by german industry yet , compared to , say , eastern europe , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is definitely room to catch up , and i 'm sure this is one of the main reasons for bruederle 's visit . "
" turkey was , of course , affected by the financial crisis like everyone else , " dreger continued .
" the economy fell by about 5 percent in 2009 , but it has recovered very well . "
cebit partnership all this has whet germany 's appetite for greater investment and economic partnership .
as if to underline the significance of bruederle 's visit , the world 's biggest information technology tradeshow cebit , staged in hanover every year , announced this week that turkey would be its partner nation in 2011 , giving turkish it companies a new platform .
trade show organizers messe ag , which also runs an annual it trade fair in turkey , and the german federal association for information technology -lrb- bitkom -rrb- , announced a partnership with the turkish chamber of commerce , and hailed the expanding it market in turkey , predicting an 8 percent growth in the sector this year .
bildunterschrift : turkey will be cebit 's partner country in 2011 hartwig von sass , spokesman for cebit , explained the process by which turkey was chosen .
" there was a survey of a variety of factors - business potential , market potential , import / export rates - and turkey was right up there on our list , " he said .
" and we soon encountered a lot of interest from turkey .
we saw eye to eye pretty quickly . "
the elephant in the room - eu entry there are now 4,000 companies in turkey that have some german investment , mainly selling cars or car-parts , machinery and electrical equipment .
and germany , for its part , is buying more and more turkish clothes , textiles and cars .
but this talk of mutual benefit obscures the fact that turkey is more reliant on germany than vice versa .
" as far as exports go , turkey is , of course , not as important to germany as germany is to turkey , " dreger said .
" around two-thirds of german exports go to the eu , the us accounts for another 10 percent , followed by china - after that comes turkey . "
nor can these promising new signs of economic partnership necessarily oil the wheels of turkey 's tortuous application for entry into the eu .
von sass was careful not to portray the cebit partnership as some kind of catalyst in national negotiations .
" of course , other factors , like the political relationship , play their part , but the question of eu application and entry is irrelevant , " he said .
dreger also played down the chances of accelerating turkey 's application process .
even with so many economic factors in its favor , turkey 's economy is still all about future potential , and many economic circumstances still stand in the way , not least inflation and unemployment - as many as one in four young turks are currently out of a job .
" of course , this is as much a political question as anything - turkey 's relationship to the eu is constantly wavering between privileged partnership and membership , " dreger said .
" turkey is in a very good position economically - there is high growth .
but on the other hand , average living standards in turkey are still well below the eu average . "

but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 28.05.2010 protests sweep france to oppose retirement age increase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union cgt said it would probably call a general strike the french government is planning on raising the minimum retirement age of 60 , one of europe 's lowest , by two or three years as part of a pension reform plan .
but much of france 's workforce is prepared to put up a fight . hundreds of thousands of workers in france on wednesday demonstrated against a government plan to raise the minimum retirement age , which is one of the most generous in europe .
numbers of protestors varied widely between police estimates - about 395,000 nation-wide - to claims made by unions - close to 1 million .
marches were reported in paris , marseille , lille , bordeaux and other cities .
" the weak turnout shows the government 's approach is the correct one , " said government spokesman luc chatel .
" the government is not indulging in triumphalism , but this mobilization shows the validity of its method , which is one of listening , of dialogue and of determination to put in place fair and balanced reform . "
unions attacked the government 's claims and insisted the turnout was well above a day of similar protests in march of last year .
" only a show of force on the streets can defend the 60-year retirement age and the social achievements that -lrb- president -rrb- nicolas sarkozy is methodically attacking , " said bernard thibault , leader of the powerful union cgt .
a system unsustainable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's government insists the reform is necessary france , along with many other european countries , is struggling to control rising public deficits in the midst of fierce opposition from labor activists .
french media outlets report that the government 's proposal would increase the minimum retirement age to 62 or 63 , as well as extend the period of time in which workers must contribute to the state pension fund to 42 years from 40.5 years .
sarkozy 's center-right government says the current retirement age , which the socialist president francois mitterrand dropped to 60 from 65 in 1983 , is an unsustainable burden on the state pension system .
the government-appointed pensions advisory council reported last month that under the current system , the state pension fund will likely face a 70-billion euro -lrb- $ 86 billion -rrb- funding gap by 2030 .
that could then increase to more than 100 billion euros by 2050 , it reported .
below the average despite the theoretical minimum retirement age , the average retirement age in france is actually 58.7 years for men and 59.5 years for women , compared to an average of 63.5 and 62.3 among member states of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in addition , france has one of the world 's longest life-expectancy rates , meaning french workers on average spend a quarter century in retirement. acb / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 28.05.2010 jamming of dw is part of ethiopia 's campaign against press freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dw reporter interviews an election helper in ethiopia .
coinciding with ethiopia 's parliamentary election last sunday , dw 's amharic service in the country was deliberately jammed .
it is part of the government 's strategy to silence independent media . " these methods are a violation of international law and - what is even more important - they are a violation of human rights , particularly the right to freedom of information for people all over the world , " deutsche welle 's director general erik betterman said following the news of the intentional disruption of deutsche welle broadcasting during the election by the ethiopian government .
just as in 2007 and 2008 , deutsche welle 's amharic radio broadcasts were subjected to jamming , i.e. the deliberate interference of deutsche welle 's short wave signal .
two and three years ago it was the invasion of ethiopian soldiers into somalia and increasing border tensions with eritrea that led the government in addis abeba to disrupt transmission of deutsche welle .
germany 's international broadcaster has been transmitting in ethiopia 's official language , amharic , since 1965 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw director general erik bettermann protested against the jamming efforts bettermann has called the renewed interference of dw 's frequencies a drastic attack against " germany 's voice for human rights . "
jamming linked to elections according to ambroise pierre , director for africa at reporters without borders in paris , the government 's latest jamming efforts are linked to parliamentary elections in ethiopia .
" the jamming of deutsche welle in ethiopia must obviously and directly be viewed in a political context .
the election on may 23 was an important milestone for meles zenawi and his government .
this government made it impossible for domestic and international media to inform the ethiopians independently , " pierre said .
on the world stage prime minister meles , a marxist and former guerilla fighter who has led the country for 19 years , presents himself as africa 's negotiator on climate issues and the g-20 .
but at home in addis abebba , the seat for the african union , human rights groups say he bullies the opposition , journalists and civil society activists .
freedom of press not respected in may after the jamming of the amharic broadcasts of voice of america became public , reporters without borders sent an open letter to meles , urging him to uphold the freedom of the press during the election .
that demand was ignored , said pierre : " with our letter we wanted to appeal to the prime minister to not interfere with the work of the media .
but he obviously did n't heed our demand , since deutsche welle is being jammed now as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amharic department at deutsche welle in bonn , germany since the election of 2005 which was marred by 200 deaths and charges of massive fraud , the ethiopian government has been engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against the amharic service of deutsche welle .
these efforts culminated in a complaint to the german parliament alleging that dw 's reporting was biased .
while this accusation could be invalidated after broadcast manuscripts were re-translated into german , the jamming was only stopped after the intervention of chancellor angela merkel in addis abbeba in 2008 . according to bettermann the continued attacks by the ethiopian government and the blocking of unpopular internet sites through the aid of chinese software and hardware is a confirmation that germany 's broadcaster is on the right track . " since this is n't the first time that we are being jammed , this shows that what we transmit to ethiopia must be considered as very serious , " he said and added that the government in addis abbeba must be " thin-skinned " to block media access .
information educates the people and governments must be able to withstand criticism , he stressed .
ethiopian authorities could not officially be reached for comment .
however , confronted with the alleged jamming , prime minister meles denied any interference with dw 's signal in a conversation with the head of the eu 's election observer mission -lrb- eu-eom -rrb- in ethiopia .
listeners from all over the world have protested against the jamming during the election weekend .
in ethiopia people have begun calling in to the deutsche welle to express their frustration and regret that the international broadcaster could not be heard reporting on the country 's election .

the abbey ruins have been sealed off since 2009 , and in february the gate was also closed off because it was deemed unsafe .
but why is it that reading abbey , the resting place of henry i , has turned to ruins ?
reading abbey was founded by henry i in 1121 , due to its location .
the abbey was conveniently close to the thames and the kennet .
when henry i died in lyons-la-forêt , normandy in 1135 his body was returned to reading , and was buried in the front of the altar of the then incomplete abbey .
other royal persons buried in the abbey include empress matilda , william of poitiers and constance of york .
because of its royal patronage , the abbey was one of the pilgrimage centres of medieval england , and one of its richest and most important religious houses .
reading abbey was frequently visited by kings and others , most especially by henry iii who often visited three or four times a year staying several weeks on each visit .
the abbey was part destroyed during henry viii 's dissolution of the monasteries .
the abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during henry viii 's dissolution of the monasteries .
the last abbot , hugh cook faringdon , was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and hanged , drawn and quartered in front of the abbey church .
after this , the buildings of the abbey were extensively robbed , with lead , glass and facing stones removed for reuse elsewhere .
st james ' roman catholic church was built on a portion of the site of the abbey between 1837 and 1840 .
its founder was james wheble , who owned land in the area at that time .
reading gaol was built in 1844 on the eastern portion of the abbey site , replacing a small county gaol on the same site .
james wheble sold the rest of his portion of the abbey site to reading corporation to create the forbury gardens , which were opened in 1861 .
however , the ruins , exposed to the open air since henry viii carried out his dissolution of the monasteries , continue to need extensive repairs .
councillor tom stanway , lead member of reading council for culture and sport said there were " severe problems " with the abbey site .
" there 's been lots of ad hoc repairs over many years to the ruins , and that 's actually one of the causes of the problems we have at the moment , " he said .
" we 've done repairs in the past they have n't been done to the standard they should have been , and that 's exacerbating the problems we have had recently . "
cllr stanway said the reason the ruins were in such a bad state was in part due to henry viii .
" what he did was he took away all the facing stones and left us the core of the building , which was never designed to experience the great british weather , " he said .

even when the pain became sharp and shooting and her leg swollen she was unconcerned .
it was not until her biology teacher , caroline morgan , urged her to get her leg checked , that she took it seriously .
but within hours doctors had found three clots in her leg and billie jo feels lucky to be alive .
the 19-year-old , from portsmouth , had believed that at her age she could not have had such life-threatening clots .
life saver " what 's quite scary is that i was due to go on a college trip to iceland a couple of days later , and so the blood clots could have got a lot worse or moved while i was on the plane , " she said .
" caroline telling me to go to a doctor literally saved my life . "
the uk 's medical community needs to urgently explore why these healthy young people are dying in their thousands from this completely preventable illness professor beverley hunt but others are not so lucky .
statistics obtained from the office of national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- show for the first time that blood clots in the under-40s have claimed 1,075 deaths over four years -lrb- 2005-8 -rrb- - 60 of these deaths were aged 20 and under .
professor beverley hunt , haematologist and director of the thrombosis charity , lifeblood , said action needs to be taken immediately , with better information and training given to spot the clots .
" the statistics are staggering , " she said .
" the uk 's medical community needs to urgently explore why these healthy young people are dying in their thousands from this completely preventable illness .
" we are worried that trainee doctors , nurses and midwives are not being given the basic mandatory training to spot signs of blood clots , and that is something that must be addressed urgently .
" much more needs to be done to make sure that front-line medics properly recognise symptoms of deep vein thrombosis which , if not treated early , is an indiscriminate and devastating killer . "
signs to watch for she said misinformation was stopping people reporting problems .
" my clinics are full of young people and many of them give me the story that they had a bit of a pain in the leg , or swelling and they went to see somebody who told them they could n't possibly have a blood clot because they were too young .
" i think we need to change that perception . "
spotting deep vein thrombosis a deep vein thrombosis -lrb- dvt -rrb- might not show symptoms , but may be accompanied by some or all of the following : pain , tenderness and swelling of the leg -lrb- usually the calf -rrb- sometimes accompanied by discolouration with the leg appearing a pale , blue or reddish purple colour if thrombosis occurs in the thigh veins , the whole leg may be swollen she said that as well as death there was a risk of chronic problems , such as leg ulcers , as the vein is damaged .
lifeblood also called for more cash to tackle thrombosis prevention in hospitals - which cause an estimated 25,000 preventable deaths each year .
the charity says no money has been allocated centrally for a group set up by the department of health to allow hospitals to share best practice in thrombosis prevention .
they said no funding has been earmarked for training and resources for those involved in the prevention of the condition .
investigating clots meanwhile billie-jo , who suffered her clot in march is slowly recovering , but still needs to take regular blood thinning drugs and wear support stockings .
she was healthy and did not have any of the common factors associated with thrombosis : things like being inactive , overweight or being a smoker .
" they do n't know why i got the clots , but i am seeing a haematologist .
" i was lucky they were caught early on and had not moved up any higher .
" i know how dangerous clots are from studying them in biology .
" i thought i was too young and that it was just what older people get . "

even when the pain became sharp and shooting and her leg swollen she was unconcerned .
it was not until her biology teacher , caroline morgan , urged her to get her leg checked , that she took it seriously .
but within hours doctors had found three clots in her leg and billie jo feels lucky to be alive .
the 19-year-old , from portsmouth , had believed that at her age she could not have had such life-threatening clots .
life saver " what 's quite scary is that i was due to go on a college trip to iceland a couple of days later , and so the blood clots could have got a lot worse or moved while i was on the plane , " she said .

the uk 's medical community needs to urgently explore why these healthy young people are dying in their thousands from this completely preventable illness professor beverley hunt but others are not so lucky .
statistics obtained from the office of national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- show for the first time that blood clots in the under-40s have claimed 1,075 deaths over four years -lrb- 2005-8 -rrb- - 60 of these deaths were aged 20 and under .
professor beverley hunt , haematologist and director of the thrombosis charity , lifeblood , said action needs to be taken immediately , with better information and training given to spot the clots .
" the statistics are staggering , " she said .
" the uk 's medical community needs to urgently explore why these healthy young people are dying in their thousands from this completely preventable illness .
" we are worried that trainee doctors , nurses and midwives are not being given the basic mandatory training to spot signs of blood clots , and that is something that must be addressed urgently .
" much more needs to be done to make sure that front-line medics properly recognise symptoms of deep vein thrombosis which , if not treated early , is an indiscriminate and devastating killer . "
signs to watch for she said misinformation was stopping people reporting problems .
" my clinics are full of young people and many of them give me the story that they had a bit of a pain in the leg , or swelling and they went to see somebody who told them they could n't possibly have a blood clot because they were too young .
" i think we need to change that perception . "
spotting deep vein thrombosis a deep vein thrombosis -lrb- dvt -rrb- might not show symptoms , but may be accompanied by some or all of the following : pain , tenderness and swelling of the leg -lrb- usually the calf -rrb- sometimes accompanied by discolouration with the leg appearing a pale , blue or reddish purple colour if thrombosis occurs in the thigh veins , the whole leg may be swollen she said that as well as death there was a risk of chronic problems , such as leg ulcers , as the vein is damaged .
lifeblood also called for more cash to tackle thrombosis prevention in hospitals - which cause an estimated 25,000 preventable deaths each year .
the charity says no money has been allocated centrally for a group set up by the department of health to allow hospitals to share best practice in thrombosis prevention .
they said no funding has been earmarked for training and resources for those involved in the prevention of the condition .
investigating clots meanwhile billie-jo , who suffered her clot in march is slowly recovering , but still needs to take regular blood thinning drugs and wear support stockings .
she was healthy and did not have any of the common factors associated with thrombosis : things like being inactive , overweight or being a smoker .
" they do n't know why i got the clots , but i am seeing a haematologist .
" i was lucky they were caught early on and had not moved up any higher .
" i know how dangerous clots are from studying them in biology .
" i thought i was too young and that it was just what older people get . "
