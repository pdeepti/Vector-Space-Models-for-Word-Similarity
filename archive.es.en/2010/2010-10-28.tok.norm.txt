the move has already been met with opposition from several member states . chancellor angela merkel has defended a german-french proposal to impose stiffer penalties on european union countries that breach the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
speaking to the lower house of parliament on the eve of an eu summit in brussels on thursday , chancellor merkel said that germany and france would insist on tougher financial rules , even if it meant amending the lisbon treaty , which regulates how the 27-member block operates .
" we need a new , robust framework .
it must be legally watertight and this will happen only with a change of the european treaties , " she said .
the stability and growth pact requires eurozone countries to maintain a budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross domestic product .
however , it has been criticized for lacking proper enforcement mechanisms .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are pushing for tighter rules - but not everyone in the eu agrees chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are proposing the introduction of semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
" it is true , german-french unity is not everything in europe , " merkel told the bundestag , but added that " without franco-german agreement , little would come of many things - that is true in this case too . "
but the eu is already on a collision course ahead of thursday 's summit , because some smaller members , like luxembourg , are strongly opposed to a proposal that would freeze a member country 's voting rights if it breached the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
new emergency fund the chancellor also said that germany would support the extension of the current 750-million-euro -lrb- one-trillion-dollar -rrb- eurozone rescue package when it expires in 2013 , but that would require changes to the lisbon treaty .
merkel was also calling for a new emergency eu fund that would rely less on contributions from taxpayers and require more involvement from private banks .
germany pays the lions ' share into the current fund .
merkel told the bundestag that such a bailout fund was necessary to help prevent future financial crises in the 16-member eurozone .
" today , we must provide a new and robust framework for coping with financial crises , " she said .
" this new framework must be legitimate and invulnerable , with no ifs or buts , in no uncertain terms . "
merkel added that this would only be possible with changes to the lisbon treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 28.10.2010 china gaining ground in eastern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china development bank is one of many state institutions investing in eastern europe china 's influence on europe 's economies is growing .
countries in eastern europe need capital , and china is willing to give it to them at unbeatable interest rates in order to achieve its geopolitical goals . the number of large-scale chinese projects in eastern european countries is growing , according to the committee on eastern european economic relations , ost-ausschuss der deutschen wirtschaf t -lrb- oa -rrb- .
this influential lobbying group for german industries involved in the region said such deals particularly focused on infrastructure .
according to an oa survey published earlier this month , chinese funding has enabled a slew of new ventures .
in serbia , the export-import bank of china -lrb- exim -rrb- has helped finance a 170-million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge project in belgrade .
china and croatia have agreed to build a new airport in zagreb , and a chinese industrial zone is to be constructed in bulgaria , near the capital sofia .
the china development bank has said it will help support the expansion of wind energy in romania , in addition to china 's plans to invest a total of some one billion euros in the romanian energy , agricultural and mining sectors .
in moldova , the china overseas engineering group -lrb- covec -rrb- is to conduct infrastructure projects with a total value of one billion euros - amounting to some 10 percent of moldova 's entire gdp .
eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from the german council on foreign relations dgap , said beijing is keen on securing resources and gaining access to markets in all of these countries .
but most importantly , china wants to gradually position itself strategically in the region , he said .
" such poor nations , which are easier to impress than other countries by the mass of chinese investment sums , are often grateful objects to enter into such policies , " sandschneider said .
distorting competition one project in particular has caused quite a stir .
last year , covec - the subsidiary of the state-owned chinese railway - won two public contracts in poland for the construction of two sections of the a2 motorway between warsaw and lodz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are also cashing in in eu countries the project is funded by a 500-million euro loan from the european investment bank .
it is the first time that such a major eu construction project has been awarded to a chinese contractor .
the european construction industry federation -lrb- fiec -rrb- in brussels said covec underbid the construction costs by 30 percent from the next bidder .
for fiec , it 's a clear case of distorting competition .
it suspects the chinese state is providing direct and thus unfair help for covec and will probably bear any losses which may result .
" if our companies were also supported with 500 million dollars in state aid , we could also offer cheaper prices , " said ulrich paetzold , fiec 's director general .
" but our companies can simply not compete fairly with the people 's republic of china . "
oa said in its survey it suspected that the project is also to serve as a reference for similar invitations to tender in bulgaria , romania and hungary .
dubious financing the oa survey found that china was taking advantage of the current economic climate , using aggressive financing methods .
" china of course has used the economic crisis in western europe in order to win market shares , " said oa chairman klaus mangold .
" there 's nothing to say against affordable financing , when they are in some way economically comprehensible .
but this is not the case . "
the exim deal with serbia , for example , involved a loan of 145 million euros at three percent interest for a period of 15 years .
the normal market interest rate for such a project , however , is a minimum of six percent over a period of five years , oa said .
" this can not be justified at all as an interest rate orientated to international markets , " mangold said .
oa said in its survey that the chinese credit institutions ' risk assessment appeared to correlate directly with the strategic interests of the political leadership in beijing .
" the greater the political interest , the lower the guarantees required , " the committee said .
regulatory measures many eastern european countries have no qualms taking advantage of china 's financing methods .
even crisis-plagued greece is happy to have a strong investor in times when western backers are showing reservations in pumping money to athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china controls part of piraeus , greece 's largest seaport greece already in 2007 entered into a " strategic partnership " with china .
the chinese maritime freight group cosco took over control of part of the container port in piraeus in 2008 .
the thessaloniki port is next on the agenda .
greece is the ideal bridgehead for chinese trade to europe , said christos alexakis , head of invest in greece , the agency that promotes and facilitates private investment there .
not only does his country profit from chinese capital , he said .
" there 's also a significant psychological aspect which benefits us , " alexakis said .
" it is very encouraging to underline china 's decisiveness in its course of action in greece .
where other fear turbulence and back down , chinese companies such as cosco decide to set out and profit from a strategically important transport project in europe . "
but not everyone is as happy as alexakis about china 's involvement in europe .
last month , german chancellor angela merkel recommended limiting chinese access to eu government contracts .
calling for more transparency , she said it had to be clear how much chinese companies were being supported by state institutions and banks when competing for contracts with european firms .
fiec 's paetzold said regulations needed to be sharpened so that such dumping offers could be ruled out .
but dgap 's sandschneider said critics should be careful talking about the distortion of competition considering the amount of official backing available for various sectors in the eu .
" as long as this level of subsidies exists in the eu , it 's difficult to truly attack the fact that the chinese government is trying to position its companies globally and come to their aid to a degree that it could have an effect , " sandschneider said .
meanwhile , the chinese government has now undertaken its latest investment at the doorway to europe with a 28-billion dollar railway project in turkey .

but one hospital in zambia is getting help treating patients from the internet . the benefits of moving to the zambian town of macha are n't immediately obvious .
but for general practitioner jonathan sitali being some 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- southwest of the capital , lusaka , had one clear advantage over other cities .
" i thought i could combine e-studies with work , " he said .
" i started looking for a place to work which had facilities for free or very cheap internet , and macha turned out to be one of those . "
in fact , people in macha work to stay in touch with the rest of the world , both in a physical sense - explaining why they built an airstrip for light aircraft - as well as in the virtual sense .
the city 's population of 30,000 live in the heart of zambian bush , but they 're among the country 's most internet-savvy .
access to the world wide web 's keeps the people of macha connected to the larger world , and it is also keeping them healthy .
learning online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor jonathan sitali studies health management online thanks to online classes , sitali is taking part in a health management master 's program at the university of liverpool with doctors from tanzania , nigeria and europe .
in the same hospital , nursing director edgar susiku is studying ultrasound diagnosis in an online course .
it 's a subject he would n't be able to enroll in anywhere in zambia .
soon said he hopes to be able to use the ultrasound equipment that was donated to the macha hospital and has sat unused for years .
he 'll only have to travel to a classroom for the final exams .
" i check my assignments and submit them online , " he said of the course he 's doing with the burwin institute in canada .
" that has made it easier to take part . "
the hospital worked closely with johns hopkins university in the united states on malaria research and it was this cooperative experience that led to the hospital and then in 2004 the rest of the city to go online .
internet a ' necessity ' dutch doctor janneke van dijk , who went to macha as part of the malaria research team , said when she first traveled to the city in 2003 the situation was grim .
" when we came there were no communications facilities , no mobile phone network , no internet , " she said , adding that only so called bush mail - short messages sent by radio - were available .
" but to be able to do research you need to be able to communicate and access information so that was one of the major tasks . "
she said the internet is a necessity , both for her own work and for the community to continue developing .
" the internet , of course , helps you gain knowledge and be aware of what kind of developments are happening , " she said .
" you can hardly do any research or receive any funding if you do n't have any means of communication . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satellite dish links macha to the web but it 's africa 's sheer size that makes the internet an even more valuable tool .
despite being isolated , places like macha are able to tap in to knowledge from the other side of the world .
no online cure-all the people of macha , however , are still waiting for another technological breakthrough : telemedicine .
at the moment patients often have to fly to lusaka for tests , which waste valuable time the seriously ill do n't have , susiku said .
" in all of zambia we have four radiology institutes , " he said .
" telemedicine could really help us take care of patients by speeding up and improving our diagnosis of patients . "
so far , only one hospital in zambia , the mtendere mission hospital in kafue - has access to uk-supported telemedicine technology .
but there 's another problem the internet wo n't be able to solve .
macha has to become a long-term destination for doctors rather than just a stopover .
sitali said when he has passed his exams he hopes to open a clinic in lusaka , where he 'll be able to earn more with his new skills .
" stay here ?
no , i 'll use this knowledge to go somewhere else , " he said .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

the move has already been met with opposition from several member states . chancellor angela merkel has defended a german-french proposal to impose stiffer penalties on european union countries that breach the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
speaking to the lower house of parliament on the eve of an eu summit in brussels on thursday , chancellor merkel said that germany and france would insist on tougher financial rules , even if it meant amending the lisbon treaty , which regulates how the 27-member block operates .
" we need a new , robust framework .
it must be legally watertight and this will happen only with a change of the european treaties , " she said .
the stability and growth pact requires eurozone countries to maintain a budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross domestic product .
however , it has been criticized for lacking proper enforcement mechanisms .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are pushing for tighter rules - but not everyone in the eu agrees chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are proposing the introduction of semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
" it is true , german-french unity is not everything in europe , " merkel told the bundestag , but added that " without franco-german agreement , little would come of many things - that is true in this case too . "
but the eu is already on a collision course ahead of thursday 's summit , because some smaller members , like luxembourg , are strongly opposed to a proposal that would freeze a member country 's voting rights if it breached the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
new emergency fund the chancellor also said that germany would support the extension of the current 750-million-euro -lrb- one-trillion-dollar -rrb- eurozone rescue package when it expires in 2013 , but that would require changes to the lisbon treaty .
merkel was also calling for a new emergency eu fund that would rely less on contributions from taxpayers and require more involvement from private banks .
germany pays the lions ' share into the current fund .
merkel told the bundestag that such a bailout fund was necessary to help prevent future financial crises in the 16-member eurozone .
" today , we must provide a new and robust framework for coping with financial crises , " she said .
" this new framework must be legitimate and invulnerable , with no ifs or buts , in no uncertain terms . "
merkel added that this would only be possible with changes to the lisbon treaty .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .

" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 28.10.2010 china gaining ground in eastern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china development bank is one of many state institutions investing in eastern europe china 's influence on europe 's economies is growing .
countries in eastern europe need capital , and china is willing to give it to them at unbeatable interest rates in order to achieve its geopolitical goals . the number of large-scale chinese projects in eastern european countries is growing , according to the committee on eastern european economic relations , ost-ausschuss der deutschen wirtschaf t -lrb- oa -rrb- .
this influential lobbying group for german industries involved in the region said such deals particularly focused on infrastructure .
according to an oa survey published earlier this month , chinese funding has enabled a slew of new ventures .
in serbia , the export-import bank of china -lrb- exim -rrb- has helped finance a 170-million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge project in belgrade .
china and croatia have agreed to build a new airport in zagreb , and a chinese industrial zone is to be constructed in bulgaria , near the capital sofia .
the china development bank has said it will help support the expansion of wind energy in romania , in addition to china 's plans to invest a total of some one billion euros in the romanian energy , agricultural and mining sectors .
in moldova , the china overseas engineering group -lrb- covec -rrb- is to conduct infrastructure projects with a total value of one billion euros - amounting to some 10 percent of moldova 's entire gdp .
eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from the german council on foreign relations dgap , said beijing is keen on securing resources and gaining access to markets in all of these countries .
but most importantly , china wants to gradually position itself strategically in the region , he said .
" such poor nations , which are easier to impress than other countries by the mass of chinese investment sums , are often grateful objects to enter into such policies , " sandschneider said .
distorting competition one project in particular has caused quite a stir .
last year , covec - the subsidiary of the state-owned chinese railway - won two public contracts in poland for the construction of two sections of the a2 motorway between warsaw and lodz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are also cashing in in eu countries the project is funded by a 500-million euro loan from the european investment bank .
it is the first time that such a major eu construction project has been awarded to a chinese contractor .
the european construction industry federation -lrb- fiec -rrb- in brussels said covec underbid the construction costs by 30 percent from the next bidder .
for fiec , it 's a clear case of distorting competition .
it suspects the chinese state is providing direct and thus unfair help for covec and will probably bear any losses which may result .
" if our companies were also supported with 500 million dollars in state aid , we could also offer cheaper prices , " said ulrich paetzold , fiec 's director general .
" but our companies can simply not compete fairly with the people 's republic of china . "
oa said in its survey it suspected that the project is also to serve as a reference for similar invitations to tender in bulgaria , romania and hungary .
dubious financing the oa survey found that china was taking advantage of the current economic climate , using aggressive financing methods .
" china of course has used the economic crisis in western europe in order to win market shares , " said oa chairman klaus mangold .
" there 's nothing to say against affordable financing , when they are in some way economically comprehensible .
but this is not the case . "
the exim deal with serbia , for example , involved a loan of 145 million euros at three percent interest for a period of 15 years .
the normal market interest rate for such a project , however , is a minimum of six percent over a period of five years , oa said .
" this can not be justified at all as an interest rate orientated to international markets , " mangold said .
oa said in its survey that the chinese credit institutions ' risk assessment appeared to correlate directly with the strategic interests of the political leadership in beijing .
" the greater the political interest , the lower the guarantees required , " the committee said .
regulatory measures many eastern european countries have no qualms taking advantage of china 's financing methods .
even crisis-plagued greece is happy to have a strong investor in times when western backers are showing reservations in pumping money to athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china controls part of piraeus , greece 's largest seaport greece already in 2007 entered into a " strategic partnership " with china .
the chinese maritime freight group cosco took over control of part of the container port in piraeus in 2008 .
the thessaloniki port is next on the agenda .
greece is the ideal bridgehead for chinese trade to europe , said christos alexakis , head of invest in greece , the agency that promotes and facilitates private investment there .
not only does his country profit from chinese capital , he said .
" there 's also a significant psychological aspect which benefits us , " alexakis said .
" it is very encouraging to underline china 's decisiveness in its course of action in greece .
where other fear turbulence and back down , chinese companies such as cosco decide to set out and profit from a strategically important transport project in europe . "
but not everyone is as happy as alexakis about china 's involvement in europe .
last month , german chancellor angela merkel recommended limiting chinese access to eu government contracts .
calling for more transparency , she said it had to be clear how much chinese companies were being supported by state institutions and banks when competing for contracts with european firms .
fiec 's paetzold said regulations needed to be sharpened so that such dumping offers could be ruled out .
but dgap 's sandschneider said critics should be careful talking about the distortion of competition considering the amount of official backing available for various sectors in the eu .
" as long as this level of subsidies exists in the eu , it 's difficult to truly attack the fact that the chinese government is trying to position its companies globally and come to their aid to a degree that it could have an effect , " sandschneider said .
meanwhile , the chinese government has now undertaken its latest investment at the doorway to europe with a 28-billion dollar railway project in turkey .

government expenditures will be slashed for the so-called family allowance and subsidies for " hartz iv " welfare recipients .
in addition , a new surcharge on air travel and a sharp increase in the tobacco tax have been approved .
business and industry will also face cuts in the subsidies to offset the environment tax on energy consumption .
the air travel surcharge next year will add between 8 and 45 euros to the price of an airplane ticket , depending on the destination .
the finance ministry expects to take in a billion euros annually from the air surcharge alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's majority ensured the drastic budget reforms were passed the tobacco tax is expected to raise an additional 200 million euros .
the wealthy will no longer receive the family allowance , if their incomes exceed 250,000 euros for singles and 500,000 for married couples .
the government expects savings of 3.5 billion euros next year , 5.4 billion in 2012 and nearly 5.7 billion in 2013 .
furthermore , banks face tougher risk management guidelines and will have to retain a larger amount of capital liquidity to cover potential defaults .
the opposition blasted the measures as a one-sided package that penalizes the poor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 28.10.2010 german parliament passes law to extend use of nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the life spans of nuclear plants was a campaign promise despite public protests and angry diatribes from the opposition , the german government on thursday took the first major hurdle in a parliamentary vote toward extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants . the bill passed comfortably 308 to 289 , but theoretically the government had 332 votes on its side .
the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

the move has already been met with opposition from several member states . chancellor angela merkel has defended a german-french proposal to impose stiffer penalties on european union countries that breach the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
speaking to the lower house of parliament on the eve of an eu summit in brussels on thursday , chancellor merkel said that germany and france would insist on tougher financial rules , even if it meant amending the lisbon treaty , which regulates how the 27-member block operates .
" we need a new , robust framework .
it must be legally watertight and this will happen only with a change of the european treaties , " she said .
the stability and growth pact requires eurozone countries to maintain a budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross domestic product .
however , it has been criticized for lacking proper enforcement mechanisms .

" it is true , german-french unity is not everything in europe , " merkel told the bundestag , but added that " without franco-german agreement , little would come of many things - that is true in this case too . "
but the eu is already on a collision course ahead of thursday 's summit , because some smaller members , like luxembourg , are strongly opposed to a proposal that would freeze a member country 's voting rights if it breached the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
new emergency fund the chancellor also said that germany would support the extension of the current 750-million-euro -lrb- one-trillion-dollar -rrb- eurozone rescue package when it expires in 2013 , but that would require changes to the lisbon treaty .
merkel was also calling for a new emergency eu fund that would rely less on contributions from taxpayers and require more involvement from private banks .
germany pays the lions ' share into the current fund .
merkel told the bundestag that such a bailout fund was necessary to help prevent future financial crises in the 16-member eurozone .
" today , we must provide a new and robust framework for coping with financial crises , " she said .
" this new framework must be legitimate and invulnerable , with no ifs or buts , in no uncertain terms . "
merkel added that this would only be possible with changes to the lisbon treaty .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 ' nazi-era foreign ministry began building alibi in late 1940s , ' historian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministry officials already started working on an alibi in the late 1940s as co-author of a new book called " das amt und die vergangenheit " -lrb- " the office and the past " -rrb- , us historian peter hayes of northwestern university has gained insight into german diplomats involvement in nazi crimes . deutsche welle : one would have thought that 65 years after the end of world war ii everything had already been said about the involvement of the german foreign office in the nazi era .
but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .

but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 28.10.2010 german parliament passes law to extend use of nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the life spans of nuclear plants was a campaign promise despite public protests and angry diatribes from the opposition , the german government on thursday took the first major hurdle in a parliamentary vote toward extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants . the bill passed comfortably 308 to 289 , but theoretically the government had 332 votes on its side .
the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.10.2010 eu leaders take on lisbon amendments at two-day summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will likely face an uphill battle at the summit as european union leaders lock horns in brussels over controversial franco-german plans to reform the lisbon treaty , german chancellor angela merkel was standing by her demands to revamp the bloc 's financial rules . leaders of the european union 's 27 member states kicked off a two-day summit in brussels on thursday , with chancellor merkel looking to push through changes to the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .
the ever-present hesitancy of many smaller members to give up powers to brussels is also a factor in their opposition to the german-french plan .
british prime minister david cameron has also come out saying he would not support any major rewriting of the lisbon treaty .
puzzling behavior the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , said the plans by germany and france , europe 's two largest countries , would be an affront to european council president herman van rompuy , who has been called on to chair a special task force looking into eu economic governance .
" i ask myself if mr van rompuy can see the consequences here , " schulz said .
" he gets an order to detail important reforms , but before he can present anything france and germany say , ' no , we have already decided everything . " '
former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who now leads the liberal group in the european parliament , labeled germany 's backtrack on its original strict-sanctions goal as puzzling .
" i find this utterly incomprehensible , particularly from germany , " he said .
" for 10 months they have demanded stricter punishment , and then they move in the opposite direction . "
the summit opens thursday afternoon and is set to conclude friday .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .

"
written in his home on elegant praterstrasse in 1867 , the composition is world-famous and is still , for many , a synonym for the viennese way of life .
his german contemporary , johannes brahms , himself a composer of waltzes , allegedly said of the iconic piece : " unfortunately not by johannes brahms . "
a cheeky and fitting tribute to one of classical music 's best-loved works .
waltz mania sweeps europe the waltz played a major role within the strauss family .
johann strauss i was himself a gifted composer and found competition in his talented son for musical supremacy in vienna .
after strauss sr. 's early death in 1849 , his son took up the baton and ran , quickly establishing himself as a master of his craft and initiating a massive wave in popularity for the waltz across europe .
he became imperial and royal music director of the court balls and a favorite among russian nobility , giving annual summer concerts in pavlovsk , the imperial estate near st. petersburg .
he played at the world 's fair in paris in 1867 and enchanted british and american audiences .
waltz-fever spread to the united states and in 1872 , strauss appeared at the world peace jubilee in boston where he led 20,000 orchestral musicians and singers for an audience numbering 100,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss paid tribute to the danube river in what is arguably his most famous work always the composer strauss was a dashing bandmaster and very popular among women .
however he was also a diligent composer and devoted to music , jotting down notes and ideas on everything from tablecloths to paper currency .
in his lifetime , he wrote some 500 waltzes , polkas , quadrilles , marches , mazurkas and galops and 15 operettas .
although entering operetta territory relatively late in life , his works " die fledermaus " -lrb- the bat -rrb- and " der zigeunerbaron " -lrb- the gypsy baron -rrb- are two of his most famous works .
a line from " die fledermaus " - " gluecklich ist , wer vergisst , was nicht mehr zu aendern ist , " -lrb- he who forgets what ca n't be changed , is happy . -rrb- entered into common use in the german language .
after a long and illustrious career , strauss succumbed to pneumonia and died in 1899 at the age of 73 , yet his works live on and are still enjoyed in concert halls around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 28.10.2010 german parliament passes law to extend use of nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the life spans of nuclear plants was a campaign promise despite public protests and angry diatribes from the opposition , the german government on thursday took the first major hurdle in a parliamentary vote toward extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants . the bill passed comfortably 308 to 289 , but theoretically the government had 332 votes on its side .
the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .

the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 28.10.2010 russian hackers rake in millions with little fear of the law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hackers are usually one step ahead of the police cyber crime in russia is booming .
the number of attacks directed against europe , the us and russia itself is on the rise .
but so far the police are no match for the hackers . russia is considered a haven for cyber crime .
the country 's hackers are among the most professional in the world .
their tools are computers and the internet , which they skillfully use to spy , manipulate and rob bank accounts , attack websites or send spam e-mails .
the hackers are especially versatile when it comes to stealing data .
hundreds of attacks are registered daily from russia .
more than half of those are directed against the european union , canada and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : need 1,000 credit card details ?
for $ 400 they 're yours " they are a threat in particular to bank customers with more than 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- on their accounts and who use online banking , " said nikita kislizin , russian it specialist and editor-in-chief of the magazine " hacker . "
he said the target of such attacks were average internet users as well as financial institutions , corporations , media organizations and even security services .
russian hackers stole 100,000 euros from the accounts of us bank citibank in 1994 .
swedish bank nordea was targetted and lost around one million euros in 2007 .
the royal bank of scotland lost as much as seven million euros to hackers in 2008 .
and hackers are also busy attacking sites inside russia .
most of their capers are n't reported to the police or in the media , as most victims want to avoid public attention .
organized crime because high-speed internet connections are needed to carry out such activities , most of the country 's cyber criminals are said to live either in moscow or st. petersburg .
experts believe they are part of a highly organized back market .
the hackers meet with their clients in internet forums where services and prices can be discussed anonymously .
access to such a forum costs around $ 1,000 and requires a recommendation from at least three registered members .
the prices for various ' services ' are fixed .
bringing down a website costs around $ 300 per day .
for $ 400 a customer can obtain detailed data from 1,000 credit cards .
sending out a million spam e-mails costs about $ 200 .
should a job require a special skill set , the criminals often team up .
the annual turnover associated with illegal activities is estimated at around one billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through the internet hackers can access almost any computer in the world " they 're driving very big cars , " said yevgeny kaspersky , head of the internet security company kaspersky lab .
" money is their only goal , " he added .
it 's said that a gang of 10 hackers can earn around 10 million euros a year . in term of the necessary technology , the investment required is only around 20,000 euros .
and the hackers have reliable means of turning that dirty electronic money into clean cash .
the hackers spend at least 10 hours a day at the computer . they rarely take a weekend off .
should an attack require it , they will stay awake for days at a time .
and even if they 're not working on a deal , they still have to be online and check the latest anti-virus programs to see how they can be outsmarted .
the number of cyber criminals in russia is estimated at around 20,000 .
most are between 20 and 30 years old and are graduates of the country 's technical universities .
next to no fines police in russia lack both the personnel and the technology to effectively combat the hackers .
often , the authorities are simply powerless to deal with the attacks .
only around 10 percent of the crimes are ever solved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's police has little to match the hackers with also , the fight against cyber crime still is n't being made a top priority by police in russia .
there is no countrywide databank of computer-related crimes .
journalists from abroad are generally refused interviews with the branch of the russian police responsible for dealing with cyber crime .
not only that , but if a hacker does happen to get caught , he can usually expect to escape with a mild sentence .
victor pleshchuck was involved in the bank of scotland robbery .
in september 2010 he was sentenced to six years on probation and a fine .
" if you have someone in russia who earns more than a million dollars a year , he 's practically immune against prosecution , " said ilya sachkov , head of group-ib cyber crimes investigations , the only private security company trying to hunt down the hackers .
yevgeny kaspersky said it was the mindset that still needed to change .
" judges in russia just do n't get how big these crimes are - and how much money is involved . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.10.2010 eu leaders take on lisbon amendments at two-day summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will likely face an uphill battle at the summit as european union leaders lock horns in brussels over controversial franco-german plans to reform the lisbon treaty , german chancellor angela merkel was standing by her demands to revamp the bloc 's financial rules . leaders of the european union 's 27 member states kicked off a two-day summit in brussels on thursday , with chancellor merkel looking to push through changes to the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .
the ever-present hesitancy of many smaller members to give up powers to brussels is also a factor in their opposition to the german-french plan .
british prime minister david cameron has also come out saying he would not support any major rewriting of the lisbon treaty .
puzzling behavior the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , said the plans by germany and france , europe 's two largest countries , would be an affront to european council president herman van rompuy , who has been called on to chair a special task force looking into eu economic governance .
" i ask myself if mr van rompuy can see the consequences here , " schulz said .
" he gets an order to detail important reforms , but before he can present anything france and germany say , ' no , we have already decided everything . " '
former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who now leads the liberal group in the european parliament , labeled germany 's backtrack on its original strict-sanctions goal as puzzling .
" i find this utterly incomprehensible , particularly from germany , " he said .
" for 10 months they have demanded stricter punishment , and then they move in the opposite direction . "
the summit opens thursday afternoon and is set to conclude friday .

his remarks came a day after a threat to france purported to be from al-qaeda leader osama bin laden was issued . a day after a direct threat was purportedly issued to france by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , the country 's defense minister has said french troops could begin withdrawing from afghanistan from 2011 .
" there 's a fixed date for nato in the framework of its new strategy - that 's the start of 2011 , because in 2011 we 're going to transfer a whole series of districts to the afghans , " defense minister herve morin told rtl radio .
" at that moment , there could be the first movements or first withdrawals of allied forces from afghanistan .
in any case , that 's the calendar set by barack obama , that in 2011 the first american troops could quit afghanistan .
" and that 's what a certain number of european countries have started to say , " he explained , insisting that his comments were not related to the threat issued against france on wednesday by a voice claiming to be islamist militant osama bin laden .
asked whether the threat , contained in an audiotape broadcast by the arab satellite channel al-jazeera , was genuine , morin said : " we 're still in the course of trying to authenticate it .
it 's too soon to say . "

" it is very simple : as you kill , you will be killed , as you take hostages , you will be taken hostage , and as you compromise our security , we will compromise your security , " the two-minute message said .
morin insisted that france 's decision to begin postulating an exit from afghanistan from next year had " absolutely no link " to the threat .
" radical islamist movements always invoke our presence in afghanistan ; it is a frequent demand , " he said .
french troops in afghanistan , which currently number at around 3,500 , have been on the ground since 2001 .
fifty french soldiers have died fighting the taliban and allied islamist insurgents , mainly in the hilly districts just east of the capital kabul .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

the move has already been met with opposition from several member states . chancellor angela merkel has defended a german-french proposal to impose stiffer penalties on european union countries that breach the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
speaking to the lower house of parliament on the eve of an eu summit in brussels on thursday , chancellor merkel said that germany and france would insist on tougher financial rules , even if it meant amending the lisbon treaty , which regulates how the 27-member block operates .
" we need a new , robust framework .
it must be legally watertight and this will happen only with a change of the european treaties , " she said .
the stability and growth pact requires eurozone countries to maintain a budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross domestic product .
however , it has been criticized for lacking proper enforcement mechanisms .

but the eu is already on a collision course ahead of thursday 's summit , because some smaller members , like luxembourg , are strongly opposed to a proposal that would freeze a member country 's voting rights if it breached the criteria of the stability and growth pact .

germany pays the lions ' share into the current fund .
merkel told the bundestag that such a bailout fund was necessary to help prevent future financial crises in the 16-member eurozone .
" today , we must provide a new and robust framework for coping with financial crises , " she said .
" this new framework must be legitimate and invulnerable , with no ifs or buts , in no uncertain terms . "
merkel added that this would only be possible with changes to the lisbon treaty .

the move has already been met with opposition from several member states . chancellor angela merkel has defended a german-french proposal to impose stiffer penalties on european union countries that breach the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
speaking to the lower house of parliament on the eve of an eu summit in brussels on thursday , chancellor merkel said that germany and france would insist on tougher financial rules , even if it meant amending the lisbon treaty , which regulates how the 27-member block operates .
" we need a new , robust framework .
it must be legally watertight and this will happen only with a change of the european treaties , " she said .
the stability and growth pact requires eurozone countries to maintain a budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross domestic product .
however , it has been criticized for lacking proper enforcement mechanisms .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are pushing for tighter rules - but not everyone in the eu agrees chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are proposing the introduction of semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
" it is true , german-french unity is not everything in europe , " merkel told the bundestag , but added that " without franco-german agreement , little would come of many things - that is true in this case too . "
but the eu is already on a collision course ahead of thursday 's summit , because some smaller members , like luxembourg , are strongly opposed to a proposal that would freeze a member country 's voting rights if it breached the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
new emergency fund the chancellor also said that germany would support the extension of the current 750-million-euro -lrb- one-trillion-dollar -rrb- eurozone rescue package when it expires in 2013 , but that would require changes to the lisbon treaty .
merkel was also calling for a new emergency eu fund that would rely less on contributions from taxpayers and require more involvement from private banks .
germany pays the lions ' share into the current fund .
merkel told the bundestag that such a bailout fund was necessary to help prevent future financial crises in the 16-member eurozone .
" today , we must provide a new and robust framework for coping with financial crises , " she said .
" this new framework must be legitimate and invulnerable , with no ifs or buts , in no uncertain terms . "
merkel added that this would only be possible with changes to the lisbon treaty .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 28.10.2010 german parliament passes law to extend use of nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the life spans of nuclear plants was a campaign promise despite public protests and angry diatribes from the opposition , the german government on thursday took the first major hurdle in a parliamentary vote toward extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants . the bill passed comfortably 308 to 289 , but theoretically the government had 332 votes on its side .
the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 ' nazi-era foreign ministry began building alibi in late 1940s , ' historian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministry officials already started working on an alibi in the late 1940s as co-author of a new book called " das amt und die vergangenheit " -lrb- " the office and the past " -rrb- , us historian peter hayes of northwestern university has gained insight into german diplomats involvement in nazi crimes . deutsche welle : one would have thought that 65 years after the end of world war ii everything had already been said about the involvement of the german foreign office in the nazi era .
but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .

but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

countries in eastern europe need capital , and china is willing to give it to them at unbeatable interest rates in order to achieve its geopolitical goals . the number of large-scale chinese projects in eastern european countries is growing , according to the committee on eastern european economic relations , ost-ausschuss der deutschen wirtschaf t -lrb- oa -rrb- .
this influential lobbying group for german industries involved in the region said such deals particularly focused on infrastructure .
according to an oa survey published earlier this month , chinese funding has enabled a slew of new ventures .
in serbia , the export-import bank of china -lrb- exim -rrb- has helped finance a 170-million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge project in belgrade .
china and croatia have agreed to build a new airport in zagreb , and a chinese industrial zone is to be constructed in bulgaria , near the capital sofia .
the china development bank has said it will help support the expansion of wind energy in romania , in addition to china 's plans to invest a total of some one billion euros in the romanian energy , agricultural and mining sectors .
in moldova , the china overseas engineering group -lrb- covec -rrb- is to conduct infrastructure projects with a total value of one billion euros - amounting to some 10 percent of moldova 's entire gdp .
eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from the german council on foreign relations dgap , said beijing is keen on securing resources and gaining access to markets in all of these countries .
but most importantly , china wants to gradually position itself strategically in the region , he said .
" such poor nations , which are easier to impress than other countries by the mass of chinese investment sums , are often grateful objects to enter into such policies , " sandschneider said .
distorting competition one project in particular has caused quite a stir .
last year , covec - the subsidiary of the state-owned chinese railway - won two public contracts in poland for the construction of two sections of the a2 motorway between warsaw and lodz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are also cashing in in eu countries the project is funded by a 500-million euro loan from the european investment bank .
it is the first time that such a major eu construction project has been awarded to a chinese contractor .
the european construction industry federation -lrb- fiec -rrb- in brussels said covec underbid the construction costs by 30 percent from the next bidder .
for fiec , it 's a clear case of distorting competition .
it suspects the chinese state is providing direct and thus unfair help for covec and will probably bear any losses which may result .
" if our companies were also supported with 500 million dollars in state aid , we could also offer cheaper prices , " said ulrich paetzold , fiec 's director general .
" but our companies can simply not compete fairly with the people 's republic of china . "
oa said in its survey it suspected that the project is also to serve as a reference for similar invitations to tender in bulgaria , romania and hungary .
dubious financing the oa survey found that china was taking advantage of the current economic climate , using aggressive financing methods .
" china of course has used the economic crisis in western europe in order to win market shares , " said oa chairman klaus mangold .
" there 's nothing to say against affordable financing , when they are in some way economically comprehensible .
but this is not the case . "
the exim deal with serbia , for example , involved a loan of 145 million euros at three percent interest for a period of 15 years .
the normal market interest rate for such a project , however , is a minimum of six percent over a period of five years , oa said .
" this can not be justified at all as an interest rate orientated to international markets , " mangold said .
oa said in its survey that the chinese credit institutions ' risk assessment appeared to correlate directly with the strategic interests of the political leadership in beijing .
" the greater the political interest , the lower the guarantees required , " the committee said .
regulatory measures many eastern european countries have no qualms taking advantage of china 's financing methods .
even crisis-plagued greece is happy to have a strong investor in times when western backers are showing reservations in pumping money to athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china controls part of piraeus , greece 's largest seaport greece already in 2007 entered into a " strategic partnership " with china .
the chinese maritime freight group cosco took over control of part of the container port in piraeus in 2008 .
the thessaloniki port is next on the agenda .
greece is the ideal bridgehead for chinese trade to europe , said christos alexakis , head of invest in greece , the agency that promotes and facilitates private investment there .
not only does his country profit from chinese capital , he said .
" there 's also a significant psychological aspect which benefits us , " alexakis said .
" it is very encouraging to underline china 's decisiveness in its course of action in greece .
where other fear turbulence and back down , chinese companies such as cosco decide to set out and profit from a strategically important transport project in europe . "
but not everyone is as happy as alexakis about china 's involvement in europe .
last month , german chancellor angela merkel recommended limiting chinese access to eu government contracts .
calling for more transparency , she said it had to be clear how much chinese companies were being supported by state institutions and banks when competing for contracts with european firms .
fiec 's paetzold said regulations needed to be sharpened so that such dumping offers could be ruled out .
but dgap 's sandschneider said critics should be careful talking about the distortion of competition considering the amount of official backing available for various sectors in the eu .
" as long as this level of subsidies exists in the eu , it 's difficult to truly attack the fact that the chinese government is trying to position its companies globally and come to their aid to a degree that it could have an effect , " sandschneider said .
meanwhile , the chinese government has now undertaken its latest investment at the doorway to europe with a 28-billion dollar railway project in turkey .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .

" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 ' nazi-era foreign ministry began building alibi in late 1940s , ' historian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministry officials already started working on an alibi in the late 1940s as co-author of a new book called " das amt und die vergangenheit " -lrb- " the office and the past " -rrb- , us historian peter hayes of northwestern university has gained insight into german diplomats involvement in nazi crimes . deutsche welle : one would have thought that 65 years after the end of world war ii everything had already been said about the involvement of the german foreign office in the nazi era .
but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .
but i think , although we can not be 100 percent sure that we 've seen everything , we 're reasonably confident that we have the broad outline of the picture .

recently , taiwan and china signed their largest free trade agreement ever and now there is talk of a " free travel " agreement . citizens from mainland china have been allowed to travel to taiwan since 2008 , but only on designated group tours and after tedious application and selection procedures .
negotiations about " ziyouxing " or " free travel " are now underway – this would allow tourists to come to taiwan on their own . wu zhengde from taiwan 's providence university says this could be possible as early as next year , but that it will start off as a trial run .
" in this concept there is also the question of numbers .
how many people are there and what are the capacities ?
and that is exactly the problem china is dealing with now .
we just have to work on the details and see if the existing structure will suffice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists love to visit taipei 101 , one of the world 's tallest skyscrapers wu believes both economies would benefit greatly from free travel , especially because an increasing number of people from the people ’ s republic want to travel to taiwan . tourism to taiwan is increasing by the day last year , the average number of mainland chinese traveling to taiwan each day was a little over 1,100 .
in the first half of 2010 alone , that number went up to 3,400 . with around 1.2 million visitors this year already , tourists from the chinese mainland constitute the largest chunk of taiwan 's tourism .
numbers will only grow when tourists are not restricted to group travel . but some , such as ru hongjin , believe this is a dangerous development .
he is currently running a survey for taiwan 's tourism bureau and thinks this is a further device china could use to bully taiwan at will . " it will damage the economy .
we ca n't treat china like any other country because other countries do n't have such a complex relationship with taiwan .
they will try to use the economy for their political purposes , " he says . ru is also worried that china is mainly concerned with making a good impression on taiwan but alice chen , a deputy director at the tourism bureau , does not see it that way . tourism can enhance communication she feels the main goal of tourism is to enhance communication and sees china 's interest in taiwan as genuine .
she says that tourists from the mainland like to watch taiwanese television shows , which are so different from their own , and get to know taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of taiwan 's national palace museum " we were separated for so many years , for decades , so they like to come and see everything , especially taipei 101 or the palace museum .
they have an itinerary of seven or eight days .
this means they go all over the island and try to see everything . " one of the taiwanese government 's largest fears is that too many people will come in illegally , which feeds into another stereotype : that the tour guides ' number one task is making sure the visitors do not run away . " actually they do bear some responsibility and we have to make sure they come to taiwan for purposes of tourism and not for other purposes .
if a chinese tourist goes missing , we will charge the travel agency 100,000 new taiwan dollars , " says alice chen . but surprisingly , the rate of runaway chinese tourists is low in taiwan .
on average just three out of 100,000 " go missing " on a tour .
for the taiwanese tourist industry , it is certainly a risk worth taking . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 ' nazi-era foreign ministry began building alibi in late 1940s , ' historian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministry officials already started working on an alibi in the late 1940s as co-author of a new book called " das amt und die vergangenheit " -lrb- " the office and the past " -rrb- , us historian peter hayes of northwestern university has gained insight into german diplomats involvement in nazi crimes . deutsche welle : one would have thought that 65 years after the end of world war ii everything had already been said about the involvement of the german foreign office in the nazi era .
but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .
but i think , although we can not be 100 percent sure that we 've seen everything , we 're reasonably confident that we have the broad outline of the picture .

'
ahead of december 's presidential ballot in belarus , free elections in the country are an ongoing concern .
olga karatch talked with deutsche welle about the push for democracy . olga karatch is a young civil rights activist and lawyer in belarus .
she runs a human rights network called " nash dom " and is the publisher of one of the largest independent weekly newspapers in belarus , " vitebsk kurier . "
karatch has been jailed several times because of her political activities – not uncommon in belarus , where politically active students are expelled from universities and their relatives are threatened .
the german city of radebeul recently awarded karatch its " courage prize , " promising solidarity and support in her push for freedom in belarus .
peter zimmermann spoke with karatch in radebeul .
deutsche welle : olga , you have created a network in belarus called " nash dom , " which if i 'm not mistaken means " our house . "
why did you choose the name ?
what 's wrong with the house ?
olga karatch : it was created at the end of 2005 before the last presidential elections , and the common idea was that belarus is our common house , and we have to be owners in our country , and we have to be decision-makers .
because it 's a very strange situation now , but nobody decides in belarus except one person about everything ... about governmental budget , about post of main editors , of governmental newspapers , judges , chiefs of local government , members of parliament , members of city councils and many , many other things .
and so for us ... it 's some questions : the first question is local self-management – how people can be decision-makers at the local level .
and , of course , in the case for us , it 's very interesting to know more about how government spends money .
the second question is about free elections , because we think that it 's impossible that the government decides who will be members of local councils , national parliament – and of course , who would be a president , of course .
and very important for us is the question about free mass media .
because if we want to change something , we need communication , places to speak with people .
to speak with potential voters or potential supporters of ours .
and , of course , now we have several independent newspapers , which work with us very closely .
our own newspaper , of course , is called " our house , " it 's not surprising -lrb- laughs -rrb- ... very easy .
but we have 150,000 copies per month .
so this is the biggest independent newspaper in belarus .
we distribute the newspaper free in post-boxes and have a special network of our volunteers who distribute it .
i 'm glad to see that you have n't lost your sense of humor with all the criticism you have .
you have networked something like 15 cities , and you are a lawyer yourself , a political scientist , a whole lot of other things , you publish an independent weekly newspaper – what exactly does your organization do for the people ?
we help people to partake themselves .
we organize advocacy campaigns .
we are interested in everything where we can find the conflict between government and citizen .
many people can not use the law .
especially against authority .
because if they try to say , " ok , my child is ill , and i need some help from government , " but the government is very aggressive if you ask about help … we have the situations when a mother goes to a doctor and says , " i need help for my child , " and afterwards she has problems in her job because the doctor calls to boss and says , " oh , this woman is very active .
you have to do something with her . "
and you know – even for these very small questions .
if you say about political questions , of course the situation is much , much , much harder .
and we had horrible situations in our organizations when , for example , the kgb stole our activists in the street and put them into a crazy-house -lsb- mental hospital -rsb- , and used some medicines , such as in the soviet union .
it 's a reality in belarus , you know .
if authorities threaten you that badly , they threaten others who fight for their liberty .
what do you say to these people to encourage them ?
they are scared .
yeah .

government expenditures will be slashed for the so-called family allowance and subsidies for " hartz iv " welfare recipients .
in addition , a new surcharge on air travel and a sharp increase in the tobacco tax have been approved .
business and industry will also face cuts in the subsidies to offset the environment tax on energy consumption .
the air travel surcharge next year will add between 8 and 45 euros to the price of an airplane ticket , depending on the destination .
the finance ministry expects to take in a billion euros annually from the air surcharge alone .

the government expects savings of 3.5 billion euros next year , 5.4 billion in 2012 and nearly 5.7 billion in 2013 .
furthermore , banks face tougher risk management guidelines and will have to retain a larger amount of capital liquidity to cover potential defaults .
the opposition blasted the measures as a one-sided package that penalizes the poor .

"
written in his home on elegant praterstrasse in 1867 , the composition is world-famous and is still , for many , a synonym for the viennese way of life .
his german contemporary , johannes brahms , himself a composer of waltzes , allegedly said of the iconic piece : " unfortunately not by johannes brahms . "
a cheeky and fitting tribute to one of classical music 's best-loved works .
waltz mania sweeps europe the waltz played a major role within the strauss family .
johann strauss i was himself a gifted composer and found competition in his talented son for musical supremacy in vienna .
after strauss sr. 's early death in 1849 , his son took up the baton and ran , quickly establishing himself as a master of his craft and initiating a massive wave in popularity for the waltz across europe .
he became imperial and royal music director of the court balls and a favorite among russian nobility , giving annual summer concerts in pavlovsk , the imperial estate near st. petersburg .
he played at the world 's fair in paris in 1867 and enchanted british and american audiences .
waltz-fever spread to the united states and in 1872 , strauss appeared at the world peace jubilee in boston where he led 20,000 orchestral musicians and singers for an audience numbering 100,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss paid tribute to the danube river in what is arguably his most famous work always the composer strauss was a dashing bandmaster and very popular among women .
however he was also a diligent composer and devoted to music , jotting down notes and ideas on everything from tablecloths to paper currency .
in his lifetime , he wrote some 500 waltzes , polkas , quadrilles , marches , mazurkas and galops and 15 operettas .
although entering operetta territory relatively late in life , his works " die fledermaus " -lrb- the bat -rrb- and " der zigeunerbaron " -lrb- the gypsy baron -rrb- are two of his most famous works .
a line from " die fledermaus " - " gluecklich ist , wer vergisst , was nicht mehr zu aendern ist , " -lrb- he who forgets what ca n't be changed , is happy . -rrb- entered into common use in the german language .
after a long and illustrious career , strauss succumbed to pneumonia and died in 1899 at the age of 73 , yet his works live on and are still enjoyed in concert halls around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 danish proposal could give tax authorities ability to copy corporate hard drives at any time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders hoeg nissen is the host of harddisken in a dw interview , a danish tech journalist explains that the proposal has gone through a hearing , and now the tax authority is drafting a response .
computer security experts and privacy advocates are very concerned . last month , the danish ministry of taxation proposed a new bill that would allow them to copy any corporate hard drive , without warning , for the purpose of verifying that the company was paying appropriate taxes .
some conservative politicians have supported the bill in recent weeks , and while the move has n't gotten much attention outside of denmark , it could set a precedent for corporate privacy and security .
to learn more , deutsche welle spoke with anders hoeg nissen , the host of the danish broadcasting corporation 's radio program , harddisken .
deutsche welle : this plan , this proposal is to have the tax authorities keep mirror copies of corporate hard disks .
is that right ?
well , the suggestion is that they are not going to be able to keep real-time , updated , mirrors of company servers , but the idea is that they will be able to make copies of all the content of company servers whenever they want to , to be able to perform some type of control to check that the danish companies are paying their taxes and so on .
that 's how it 's worked until now , with a warrant , they could come with a couple of big hard drives in a bag and start copying .
the new law proposal suggests that they would be able to do this without a warrant at any time .
now i imagine that this would raise a lot of questions in the corporate , privacy and computer security communities , no ?
it has raised a lot of questions .
from the tech community it 's very much a data privacy discussion .
it goes against what we believe , that we are alowed to have our own data and not have the authorities be able to snoop into them at their discretion .
but the industry , the representatives of the danish companies , for example , the confederation of the danish industries ' ict department has called this worthy of a banana republic .
there 's been some very strong reactions and strong language at this presentation of this proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could takes months for this proposal to pass the danish parliament now , i understand that the tax authorities want to be able to control that people are paying their taxes .
but at the same time , allowing a government entity to have access to secure , private information , clients and other kinds of things , it just seems like you 're asking for trouble .
i would think so , yes .
what some of the companies that have reacted to this are saying is that : we have a lot of confidential information , business secrets , contacts and lots of stuff that has nothing to do with whether or not we 're paying our taxes or not , and it makes no sense that the tax authorities should gain access to all this information without some kind of warrant or some kind of suspicion that the company is not paying the taxes that they 're supposed to .
this is obviously a huge breach of the company 's private information .
who is supporting this ?
is this just an idea that has come from the tax authority itself ?
has this been supported by any political parties ?
as far as i can make out , this came from the tax authorities , but with the minister for taxes here in denmark is sanctioning this proposal that initially came from the tax authorities .
it seems that both the liberal party and the conservative party that make up the government in denmark at the moment are supporting this not as a proposal , but some of the thoughts in the proposal .
it 's not at the stage where it 's ready to be made into a law .
it 's just gone into a hearing , and they 're looking at the answers .
so what would it take for this to actually become law in denmark , and do you think it actually has a chance that it could become law ?
i just spoke to the tax authorities press office and they said that they 've received the answers from the hearing process and they 're going over those answers and trying to see if the original proposal should be somehow modified or perhaps completely taken off the table .
they would n't divulge what kind of answers they 've gotten , but we can only speculate after having read the reception in the press .
but i would guess that this will not come to an actual law , in the form that we 've seen it so far .
but should it come to that , it would take a few months , and then it would come to a vote in the parliament , and then it would or would not become a law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.10.2010 eu leaders take on lisbon amendments at two-day summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will likely face an uphill battle at the summit as european union leaders lock horns in brussels over controversial franco-german plans to reform the lisbon treaty , german chancellor angela merkel was standing by her demands to revamp the bloc 's financial rules . leaders of the european union 's 27 member states kicked off a two-day summit in brussels on thursday , with chancellor merkel looking to push through changes to the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .

news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .
the ever-present hesitancy of many smaller members to give up powers to brussels is also a factor in their opposition to the german-french plan .
british prime minister david cameron has also come out saying he would not support any major rewriting of the lisbon treaty .
puzzling behavior the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , said the plans by germany and france , europe 's two largest countries , would be an affront to european council president herman van rompuy , who has been called on to chair a special task force looking into eu economic governance .

government expenditures will be slashed for the so-called family allowance and subsidies for " hartz iv " welfare recipients .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .

petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

the move has already been met with opposition from several member states . chancellor angela merkel has defended a german-french proposal to impose stiffer penalties on european union countries that breach the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
speaking to the lower house of parliament on the eve of an eu summit in brussels on thursday , chancellor merkel said that germany and france would insist on tougher financial rules , even if it meant amending the lisbon treaty , which regulates how the 27-member block operates .
" we need a new , robust framework .
it must be legally watertight and this will happen only with a change of the european treaties , " she said .

however , it has been criticized for lacking proper enforcement mechanisms .

merkel was also calling for a new emergency eu fund that would rely less on contributions from taxpayers and require more involvement from private banks .

merkel told the bundestag that such a bailout fund was necessary to help prevent future financial crises in the 16-member eurozone .
" today , we must provide a new and robust framework for coping with financial crises , " she said .
" this new framework must be legitimate and invulnerable , with no ifs or buts , in no uncertain terms . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 ' nazi-era foreign ministry began building alibi in late 1940s , ' historian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministry officials already started working on an alibi in the late 1940s as co-author of a new book called " das amt und die vergangenheit " -lrb- " the office and the past " -rrb- , us historian peter hayes of northwestern university has gained insight into german diplomats involvement in nazi crimes . deutsche welle : one would have thought that 65 years after the end of world war ii everything had already been said about the involvement of the german foreign office in the nazi era .
but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .
but i think , although we can not be 100 percent sure that we 've seen everything , we 're reasonably confident that we have the broad outline of the picture .

dw-world.de opinion : germany 's nazi history is clouded by myths the study of the foreign office 's crimes under hitler shows that memories of the nazi period are still dominated by myths .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 28.10.2010 russian hackers rake in millions with little fear of the law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hackers are usually one step ahead of the police cyber crime in russia is booming .
the number of attacks directed against europe , the us and russia itself is on the rise .
but so far the police are no match for the hackers . russia is considered a haven for cyber crime .
the country 's hackers are among the most professional in the world .
their tools are computers and the internet , which they skillfully use to spy , manipulate and rob bank accounts , attack websites or send spam e-mails .
the hackers are especially versatile when it comes to stealing data .
hundreds of attacks are registered daily from russia .
more than half of those are directed against the european union , canada and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : need 1,000 credit card details ?
for $ 400 they 're yours " they are a threat in particular to bank customers with more than 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- on their accounts and who use online banking , " said nikita kislizin , russian it specialist and editor-in-chief of the magazine " hacker . "
he said the target of such attacks were average internet users as well as financial institutions , corporations , media organizations and even security services .
russian hackers stole 100,000 euros from the accounts of us bank citibank in 1994 .
swedish bank nordea was targetted and lost around one million euros in 2007 .
the royal bank of scotland lost as much as seven million euros to hackers in 2008 .
and hackers are also busy attacking sites inside russia .
most of their capers are n't reported to the police or in the media , as most victims want to avoid public attention .
organized crime because high-speed internet connections are needed to carry out such activities , most of the country 's cyber criminals are said to live either in moscow or st. petersburg .
experts believe they are part of a highly organized back market .
the hackers meet with their clients in internet forums where services and prices can be discussed anonymously .
access to such a forum costs around $ 1,000 and requires a recommendation from at least three registered members .
the prices for various ' services ' are fixed .
bringing down a website costs around $ 300 per day .
for $ 400 a customer can obtain detailed data from 1,000 credit cards .
sending out a million spam e-mails costs about $ 200 .
should a job require a special skill set , the criminals often team up .
the annual turnover associated with illegal activities is estimated at around one billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through the internet hackers can access almost any computer in the world " they 're driving very big cars , " said yevgeny kaspersky , head of the internet security company kaspersky lab .
" money is their only goal , " he added .
it 's said that a gang of 10 hackers can earn around 10 million euros a year . in term of the necessary technology , the investment required is only around 20,000 euros .
and the hackers have reliable means of turning that dirty electronic money into clean cash .
the hackers spend at least 10 hours a day at the computer . they rarely take a weekend off .
should an attack require it , they will stay awake for days at a time .
and even if they 're not working on a deal , they still have to be online and check the latest anti-virus programs to see how they can be outsmarted .
the number of cyber criminals in russia is estimated at around 20,000 .
most are between 20 and 30 years old and are graduates of the country 's technical universities .
next to no fines police in russia lack both the personnel and the technology to effectively combat the hackers .
often , the authorities are simply powerless to deal with the attacks .
only around 10 percent of the crimes are ever solved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's police has little to match the hackers with also , the fight against cyber crime still is n't being made a top priority by police in russia .
there is no countrywide databank of computer-related crimes .
journalists from abroad are generally refused interviews with the branch of the russian police responsible for dealing with cyber crime .
not only that , but if a hacker does happen to get caught , he can usually expect to escape with a mild sentence .
victor pleshchuck was involved in the bank of scotland robbery .
in september 2010 he was sentenced to six years on probation and a fine .
" if you have someone in russia who earns more than a million dollars a year , he 's practically immune against prosecution , " said ilya sachkov , head of group-ib cyber crimes investigations , the only private security company trying to hunt down the hackers .
yevgeny kaspersky said it was the mindset that still needed to change .
" judges in russia just do n't get how big these crimes are - and how much money is involved . "

the number of attacks directed against europe , the us and russia itself is on the rise .
but so far the police are no match for the hackers . russia is considered a haven for cyber crime .
the country 's hackers are among the most professional in the world .
their tools are computers and the internet , which they skillfully use to spy , manipulate and rob bank accounts , attack websites or send spam e-mails .
the hackers are especially versatile when it comes to stealing data .
hundreds of attacks are registered daily from russia .
more than half of those are directed against the european union , canada and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : need 1,000 credit card details ?
for $ 400 they 're yours " they are a threat in particular to bank customers with more than 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- on their accounts and who use online banking , " said nikita kislizin , russian it specialist and editor-in-chief of the magazine " hacker . "
he said the target of such attacks were average internet users as well as financial institutions , corporations , media organizations and even security services .
russian hackers stole 100,000 euros from the accounts of us bank citibank in 1994 .
swedish bank nordea was targetted and lost around one million euros in 2007 .
the royal bank of scotland lost as much as seven million euros to hackers in 2008 .
and hackers are also busy attacking sites inside russia .
most of their capers are n't reported to the police or in the media , as most victims want to avoid public attention .
organized crime because high-speed internet connections are needed to carry out such activities , most of the country 's cyber criminals are said to live either in moscow or st. petersburg .
experts believe they are part of a highly organized back market .
the hackers meet with their clients in internet forums where services and prices can be discussed anonymously .
access to such a forum costs around $ 1,000 and requires a recommendation from at least three registered members .
the prices for various ' services ' are fixed .
bringing down a website costs around $ 300 per day .
for $ 400 a customer can obtain detailed data from 1,000 credit cards .
sending out a million spam e-mails costs about $ 200 .
should a job require a special skill set , the criminals often team up .
the annual turnover associated with illegal activities is estimated at around one billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through the internet hackers can access almost any computer in the world " they 're driving very big cars , " said yevgeny kaspersky , head of the internet security company kaspersky lab .
" money is their only goal , " he added .
it 's said that a gang of 10 hackers can earn around 10 million euros a year . in term of the necessary technology , the investment required is only around 20,000 euros .
and the hackers have reliable means of turning that dirty electronic money into clean cash .
the hackers spend at least 10 hours a day at the computer . they rarely take a weekend off .
should an attack require it , they will stay awake for days at a time .
and even if they 're not working on a deal , they still have to be online and check the latest anti-virus programs to see how they can be outsmarted .
the number of cyber criminals in russia is estimated at around 20,000 .
most are between 20 and 30 years old and are graduates of the country 's technical universities .
next to no fines police in russia lack both the personnel and the technology to effectively combat the hackers .
often , the authorities are simply powerless to deal with the attacks .
only around 10 percent of the crimes are ever solved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's police has little to match the hackers with also , the fight against cyber crime still is n't being made a top priority by police in russia .
there is no countrywide databank of computer-related crimes .
journalists from abroad are generally refused interviews with the branch of the russian police responsible for dealing with cyber crime .
not only that , but if a hacker does happen to get caught , he can usually expect to escape with a mild sentence .
victor pleshchuck was involved in the bank of scotland robbery .
in september 2010 he was sentenced to six years on probation and a fine .
" if you have someone in russia who earns more than a million dollars a year , he 's practically immune against prosecution , " said ilya sachkov , head of group-ib cyber crimes investigations , the only private security company trying to hunt down the hackers .
yevgeny kaspersky said it was the mindset that still needed to change .
" judges in russia just do n't get how big these crimes are - and how much money is involved . "

"
written in his home on elegant praterstrasse in 1867 , the composition is world-famous and is still , for many , a synonym for the viennese way of life .
his german contemporary , johannes brahms , himself a composer of waltzes , allegedly said of the iconic piece : " unfortunately not by johannes brahms . "
a cheeky and fitting tribute to one of classical music 's best-loved works .
waltz mania sweeps europe the waltz played a major role within the strauss family .
johann strauss i was himself a gifted composer and found competition in his talented son for musical supremacy in vienna .
after strauss sr. 's early death in 1849 , his son took up the baton and ran , quickly establishing himself as a master of his craft and initiating a massive wave in popularity for the waltz across europe .
he became imperial and royal music director of the court balls and a favorite among russian nobility , giving annual summer concerts in pavlovsk , the imperial estate near st. petersburg .
he played at the world 's fair in paris in 1867 and enchanted british and american audiences .
waltz-fever spread to the united states and in 1872 , strauss appeared at the world peace jubilee in boston where he led 20,000 orchestral musicians and singers for an audience numbering 100,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss paid tribute to the danube river in what is arguably his most famous work always the composer strauss was a dashing bandmaster and very popular among women .
however he was also a diligent composer and devoted to music , jotting down notes and ideas on everything from tablecloths to paper currency .
in his lifetime , he wrote some 500 waltzes , polkas , quadrilles , marches , mazurkas and galops and 15 operettas .
although entering operetta territory relatively late in life , his works " die fledermaus " -lrb- the bat -rrb- and " der zigeunerbaron " -lrb- the gypsy baron -rrb- are two of his most famous works .
a line from " die fledermaus " - " gluecklich ist , wer vergisst , was nicht mehr zu aendern ist , " -lrb- he who forgets what ca n't be changed , is happy . -rrb- entered into common use in the german language .
after a long and illustrious career , strauss succumbed to pneumonia and died in 1899 at the age of 73 , yet his works live on and are still enjoyed in concert halls around the world .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .

he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

but one hospital in zambia is getting help treating patients from the internet . the benefits of moving to the zambian town of macha are n't immediately obvious .
but for general practitioner jonathan sitali being some 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- southwest of the capital , lusaka , had one clear advantage over other cities .
" i thought i could combine e-studies with work , " he said .
" i started looking for a place to work which had facilities for free or very cheap internet , and macha turned out to be one of those . "
in fact , people in macha work to stay in touch with the rest of the world , both in a physical sense - explaining why they built an airstrip for light aircraft - as well as in the virtual sense .
the city 's population of 30,000 live in the heart of zambian bush , but they 're among the country 's most internet-savvy .
access to the world wide web 's keeps the people of macha connected to the larger world , and it is also keeping them healthy .
learning online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor jonathan sitali studies health management online thanks to online classes , sitali is taking part in a health management master 's program at the university of liverpool with doctors from tanzania , nigeria and europe .
in the same hospital , nursing director edgar susiku is studying ultrasound diagnosis in an online course .
it 's a subject he would n't be able to enroll in anywhere in zambia .
soon said he hopes to be able to use the ultrasound equipment that was donated to the macha hospital and has sat unused for years .
he 'll only have to travel to a classroom for the final exams .
" i check my assignments and submit them online , " he said of the course he 's doing with the burwin institute in canada .
" that has made it easier to take part . "
the hospital worked closely with johns hopkins university in the united states on malaria research and it was this cooperative experience that led to the hospital and then in 2004 the rest of the city to go online .
internet a ' necessity ' dutch doctor janneke van dijk , who went to macha as part of the malaria research team , said when she first traveled to the city in 2003 the situation was grim .
" when we came there were no communications facilities , no mobile phone network , no internet , " she said , adding that only so called bush mail - short messages sent by radio - were available .
" but to be able to do research you need to be able to communicate and access information so that was one of the major tasks . "
she said the internet is a necessity , both for her own work and for the community to continue developing .
" the internet , of course , helps you gain knowledge and be aware of what kind of developments are happening , " she said .
" you can hardly do any research or receive any funding if you do n't have any means of communication . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a satellite dish links macha to the web but it 's africa 's sheer size that makes the internet an even more valuable tool .
despite being isolated , places like macha are able to tap in to knowledge from the other side of the world .
no online cure-all the people of macha , however , are still waiting for another technological breakthrough : telemedicine .
at the moment patients often have to fly to lusaka for tests , which waste valuable time the seriously ill do n't have , susiku said .
" in all of zambia we have four radiology institutes , " he said .
" telemedicine could really help us take care of patients by speeding up and improving our diagnosis of patients . "
so far , only one hospital in zambia , the mtendere mission hospital in kafue - has access to uk-supported telemedicine technology .
but there 's another problem the internet wo n't be able to solve .
macha has to become a long-term destination for doctors rather than just a stopover .
sitali said when he has passed his exams he hopes to open a clinic in lusaka , where he 'll be able to earn more with his new skills .
" stay here ?
no , i 'll use this knowledge to go somewhere else , " he said .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de democracy -pipe- 28.10.2010 ' we need solidarity , ' says belarus activist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olga karatch runs the belarus human rights network ' nash dom , ' or ' our house . '
ahead of december 's presidential ballot in belarus , free elections in the country are an ongoing concern .
olga karatch talked with deutsche welle about the push for democracy . olga karatch is a young civil rights activist and lawyer in belarus .
she runs a human rights network called " nash dom " and is the publisher of one of the largest independent weekly newspapers in belarus , " vitebsk kurier . "
karatch has been jailed several times because of her political activities – not uncommon in belarus , where politically active students are expelled from universities and their relatives are threatened .
the german city of radebeul recently awarded karatch its " courage prize , " promising solidarity and support in her push for freedom in belarus .
peter zimmermann spoke with karatch in radebeul .
deutsche welle : olga , you have created a network in belarus called " nash dom , " which if i 'm not mistaken means " our house . "
why did you choose the name ?
what 's wrong with the house ?
olga karatch : it was created at the end of 2005 before the last presidential elections , and the common idea was that belarus is our common house , and we have to be owners in our country , and we have to be decision-makers .
because it 's a very strange situation now , but nobody decides in belarus except one person about everything ... about governmental budget , about post of main editors , of governmental newspapers , judges , chiefs of local government , members of parliament , members of city councils and many , many other things .
and so for us ... it 's some questions : the first question is local self-management – how people can be decision-makers at the local level .
and , of course , in the case for us , it 's very interesting to know more about how government spends money .
the second question is about free elections , because we think that it 's impossible that the government decides who will be members of local councils , national parliament – and of course , who would be a president , of course .
and very important for us is the question about free mass media .
because if we want to change something , we need communication , places to speak with people .
to speak with potential voters or potential supporters of ours .
and , of course , now we have several independent newspapers , which work with us very closely .
our own newspaper , of course , is called " our house , " it 's not surprising -lrb- laughs -rrb- ... very easy .
but we have 150,000 copies per month .
so this is the biggest independent newspaper in belarus .
we distribute the newspaper free in post-boxes and have a special network of our volunteers who distribute it .
i 'm glad to see that you have n't lost your sense of humor with all the criticism you have .
you have networked something like 15 cities , and you are a lawyer yourself , a political scientist , a whole lot of other things , you publish an independent weekly newspaper – what exactly does your organization do for the people ?
we help people to partake themselves .
we organize advocacy campaigns .
we are interested in everything where we can find the conflict between government and citizen .
many people can not use the law .
especially against authority .
because if they try to say , " ok , my child is ill , and i need some help from government , " but the government is very aggressive if you ask about help … we have the situations when a mother goes to a doctor and says , " i need help for my child , " and afterwards she has problems in her job because the doctor calls to boss and says , " oh , this woman is very active .
you have to do something with her . "
and you know – even for these very small questions .
if you say about political questions , of course the situation is much , much , much harder .
and we had horrible situations in our organizations when , for example , the kgb stole our activists in the street and put them into a crazy-house -lsb- mental hospital -rsb- , and used some medicines , such as in the soviet union .
it 's a reality in belarus , you know .
if authorities threaten you that badly , they threaten others who fight for their liberty .
what do you say to these people to encourage them ?
they are scared .
yeah .
but the rain can not go on forever , you know -lrb- laughs -rrb- .
the system can be broken only if we fight .
and we have a lot of victories , to be honest .
i understand one thing : nobody can feel the pressure of the system alone .
if you feel the pressure , you could be broken if you are alone .
it 's impossible .
because the system is so strong .
but if we are together , if we help each other , if we build a network and protect each other and feel our solidarity , it 's possible .
and we can win in this case .
you were awarded the courage prize of the city of radebeul for your courage .
what would you say to people all over the world – in the usa , in western europe , in africa , asia – about the situation in belarus and your government ?
is there any kind of help you would ask for ?
is there something you would want them to do ?
we need solidarity .
it 's very important for us .
and when people fight and have so many risks to be in prison , to be stolen , to be under stress , to lose job and many other problems . we need solidarity .
we want to know that we are not alone .
we want to be a part of a european family , and we believe that democracy can go to belarus .
because so many people await it .

news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .
the ever-present hesitancy of many smaller members to give up powers to brussels is also a factor in their opposition to the german-french plan .
british prime minister david cameron has also come out saying he would not support any major rewriting of the lisbon treaty .
puzzling behavior the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , said the plans by germany and france , europe 's two largest countries , would be an affront to european council president herman van rompuy , who has been called on to chair a special task force looking into eu economic governance .
" i ask myself if mr van rompuy can see the consequences here , " schulz said .
" he gets an order to detail important reforms , but before he can present anything france and germany say , ' no , we have already decided everything . " '
former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who now leads the liberal group in the european parliament , labeled germany 's backtrack on its original strict-sanctions goal as puzzling .
" i find this utterly incomprehensible , particularly from germany , " he said .
" for 10 months they have demanded stricter punishment , and then they move in the opposite direction . "
the summit opens thursday afternoon and is set to conclude friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 ' nazi-era foreign ministry began building alibi in late 1940s , ' historian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministry officials already started working on an alibi in the late 1940s as co-author of a new book called " das amt und die vergangenheit " -lrb- " the office and the past " -rrb- , us historian peter hayes of northwestern university has gained insight into german diplomats involvement in nazi crimes . deutsche welle : one would have thought that 65 years after the end of world war ii everything had already been said about the involvement of the german foreign office in the nazi era .
but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .
but i think , although we can not be 100 percent sure that we 've seen everything , we 're reasonably confident that we have the broad outline of the picture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 danish proposal could give tax authorities ability to copy corporate hard drives at any time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders hoeg nissen is the host of harddisken in a dw interview , a danish tech journalist explains that the proposal has gone through a hearing , and now the tax authority is drafting a response .
computer security experts and privacy advocates are very concerned . last month , the danish ministry of taxation proposed a new bill that would allow them to copy any corporate hard drive , without warning , for the purpose of verifying that the company was paying appropriate taxes .
some conservative politicians have supported the bill in recent weeks , and while the move has n't gotten much attention outside of denmark , it could set a precedent for corporate privacy and security .
to learn more , deutsche welle spoke with anders hoeg nissen , the host of the danish broadcasting corporation 's radio program , harddisken .
deutsche welle : this plan , this proposal is to have the tax authorities keep mirror copies of corporate hard disks .
is that right ?
well , the suggestion is that they are not going to be able to keep real-time , updated , mirrors of company servers , but the idea is that they will be able to make copies of all the content of company servers whenever they want to , to be able to perform some type of control to check that the danish companies are paying their taxes and so on .
that 's how it 's worked until now , with a warrant , they could come with a couple of big hard drives in a bag and start copying .
the new law proposal suggests that they would be able to do this without a warrant at any time .
now i imagine that this would raise a lot of questions in the corporate , privacy and computer security communities , no ?
it has raised a lot of questions .
from the tech community it 's very much a data privacy discussion .
it goes against what we believe , that we are alowed to have our own data and not have the authorities be able to snoop into them at their discretion .
but the industry , the representatives of the danish companies , for example , the confederation of the danish industries ' ict department has called this worthy of a banana republic .
there 's been some very strong reactions and strong language at this presentation of this proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could takes months for this proposal to pass the danish parliament now , i understand that the tax authorities want to be able to control that people are paying their taxes .
but at the same time , allowing a government entity to have access to secure , private information , clients and other kinds of things , it just seems like you 're asking for trouble .
i would think so , yes .
what some of the companies that have reacted to this are saying is that : we have a lot of confidential information , business secrets , contacts and lots of stuff that has nothing to do with whether or not we 're paying our taxes or not , and it makes no sense that the tax authorities should gain access to all this information without some kind of warrant or some kind of suspicion that the company is not paying the taxes that they 're supposed to .
this is obviously a huge breach of the company 's private information .
who is supporting this ?
is this just an idea that has come from the tax authority itself ?
has this been supported by any political parties ?
as far as i can make out , this came from the tax authorities , but with the minister for taxes here in denmark is sanctioning this proposal that initially came from the tax authorities .
it seems that both the liberal party and the conservative party that make up the government in denmark at the moment are supporting this not as a proposal , but some of the thoughts in the proposal .
it 's not at the stage where it 's ready to be made into a law .
it 's just gone into a hearing , and they 're looking at the answers .
so what would it take for this to actually become law in denmark , and do you think it actually has a chance that it could become law ?
i just spoke to the tax authorities press office and they said that they 've received the answers from the hearing process and they 're going over those answers and trying to see if the original proposal should be somehow modified or perhaps completely taken off the table .
they would n't divulge what kind of answers they 've gotten , but we can only speculate after having read the reception in the press .
but i would guess that this will not come to an actual law , in the form that we 've seen it so far .
but should it come to that , it would take a few months , and then it would come to a vote in the parliament , and then it would or would not become a law .

the number of attacks directed against europe , the us and russia itself is on the rise .
but so far the police are no match for the hackers . russia is considered a haven for cyber crime .
the country 's hackers are among the most professional in the world .
their tools are computers and the internet , which they skillfully use to spy , manipulate and rob bank accounts , attack websites or send spam e-mails .
the hackers are especially versatile when it comes to stealing data .
hundreds of attacks are registered daily from russia .
more than half of those are directed against the european union , canada and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : need 1,000 credit card details ?
for $ 400 they 're yours " they are a threat in particular to bank customers with more than 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- on their accounts and who use online banking , " said nikita kislizin , russian it specialist and editor-in-chief of the magazine " hacker . "
he said the target of such attacks were average internet users as well as financial institutions , corporations , media organizations and even security services .
russian hackers stole 100,000 euros from the accounts of us bank citibank in 1994 .
swedish bank nordea was targetted and lost around one million euros in 2007 .
the royal bank of scotland lost as much as seven million euros to hackers in 2008 .
and hackers are also busy attacking sites inside russia .
most of their capers are n't reported to the police or in the media , as most victims want to avoid public attention .
organized crime because high-speed internet connections are needed to carry out such activities , most of the country 's cyber criminals are said to live either in moscow or st. petersburg .
experts believe they are part of a highly organized back market .
the hackers meet with their clients in internet forums where services and prices can be discussed anonymously .
access to such a forum costs around $ 1,000 and requires a recommendation from at least three registered members .
the prices for various ' services ' are fixed .
bringing down a website costs around $ 300 per day .
for $ 400 a customer can obtain detailed data from 1,000 credit cards .
sending out a million spam e-mails costs about $ 200 .
should a job require a special skill set , the criminals often team up .
the annual turnover associated with illegal activities is estimated at around one billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through the internet hackers can access almost any computer in the world " they 're driving very big cars , " said yevgeny kaspersky , head of the internet security company kaspersky lab .
" money is their only goal , " he added .
it 's said that a gang of 10 hackers can earn around 10 million euros a year . in term of the necessary technology , the investment required is only around 20,000 euros .
and the hackers have reliable means of turning that dirty electronic money into clean cash .
the hackers spend at least 10 hours a day at the computer . they rarely take a weekend off .
should an attack require it , they will stay awake for days at a time .
and even if they 're not working on a deal , they still have to be online and check the latest anti-virus programs to see how they can be outsmarted .
the number of cyber criminals in russia is estimated at around 20,000 .
most are between 20 and 30 years old and are graduates of the country 's technical universities .
next to no fines police in russia lack both the personnel and the technology to effectively combat the hackers .
often , the authorities are simply powerless to deal with the attacks .
only around 10 percent of the crimes are ever solved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's police has little to match the hackers with also , the fight against cyber crime still is n't being made a top priority by police in russia .
there is no countrywide databank of computer-related crimes .
journalists from abroad are generally refused interviews with the branch of the russian police responsible for dealing with cyber crime .
not only that , but if a hacker does happen to get caught , he can usually expect to escape with a mild sentence .
victor pleshchuck was involved in the bank of scotland robbery .
in september 2010 he was sentenced to six years on probation and a fine .
" if you have someone in russia who earns more than a million dollars a year , he 's practically immune against prosecution , " said ilya sachkov , head of group-ib cyber crimes investigations , the only private security company trying to hunt down the hackers .
yevgeny kaspersky said it was the mindset that still needed to change .
" judges in russia just do n't get how big these crimes are - and how much money is involved . "

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

his remarks came a day after a threat to france purported to be from al-qaeda leader osama bin laden was issued . a day after a direct threat was purportedly issued to france by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , the country 's defense minister has said french troops could begin withdrawing from afghanistan from 2011 .
" there 's a fixed date for nato in the framework of its new strategy - that 's the start of 2011 , because in 2011 we 're going to transfer a whole series of districts to the afghans , " defense minister herve morin told rtl radio .
" at that moment , there could be the first movements or first withdrawals of allied forces from afghanistan .
in any case , that 's the calendar set by barack obama , that in 2011 the first american troops could quit afghanistan .
" and that 's what a certain number of european countries have started to say , " he explained , insisting that his comments were not related to the threat issued against france on wednesday by a voice claiming to be islamist militant osama bin laden .
asked whether the threat , contained in an audiotape broadcast by the arab satellite channel al-jazeera , was genuine , morin said : " we 're still in the course of trying to authenticate it .
it 's too soon to say . "
he added it was " not impossible " that such a tape existed and that " all of our services , and all of our allies believe osama bin laden is alive . "
audio threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western intelligence agencies believe bin laden is still alive the audio recording said france opened itself to retaliatory attacks by having sent troops into afghanistan and by having recently banned the islamic full-face veil .
" how could you take part in occupying our countries and support the americans in killing our children and women , and then expect to live in peace and security ? " the voice demanded .
" it is very simple : as you kill , you will be killed , as you take hostages , you will be taken hostage , and as you compromise our security , we will compromise your security , " the two-minute message said .
morin insisted that france 's decision to begin postulating an exit from afghanistan from next year had " absolutely no link " to the threat .
" radical islamist movements always invoke our presence in afghanistan ; it is a frequent demand , " he said .
french troops in afghanistan , which currently number at around 3,500 , have been on the ground since 2001 .
fifty french soldiers have died fighting the taliban and allied islamist insurgents , mainly in the hilly districts just east of the capital kabul .

countries in eastern europe need capital , and china is willing to give it to them at unbeatable interest rates in order to achieve its geopolitical goals . the number of large-scale chinese projects in eastern european countries is growing , according to the committee on eastern european economic relations , ost-ausschuss der deutschen wirtschaf t -lrb- oa -rrb- .
this influential lobbying group for german industries involved in the region said such deals particularly focused on infrastructure .
according to an oa survey published earlier this month , chinese funding has enabled a slew of new ventures .
in serbia , the export-import bank of china -lrb- exim -rrb- has helped finance a 170-million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge project in belgrade .
china and croatia have agreed to build a new airport in zagreb , and a chinese industrial zone is to be constructed in bulgaria , near the capital sofia .
the china development bank has said it will help support the expansion of wind energy in romania , in addition to china 's plans to invest a total of some one billion euros in the romanian energy , agricultural and mining sectors .
in moldova , the china overseas engineering group -lrb- covec -rrb- is to conduct infrastructure projects with a total value of one billion euros - amounting to some 10 percent of moldova 's entire gdp .
eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from the german council on foreign relations dgap , said beijing is keen on securing resources and gaining access to markets in all of these countries .
but most importantly , china wants to gradually position itself strategically in the region , he said .
" such poor nations , which are easier to impress than other countries by the mass of chinese investment sums , are often grateful objects to enter into such policies , " sandschneider said .
distorting competition one project in particular has caused quite a stir .
last year , covec - the subsidiary of the state-owned chinese railway - won two public contracts in poland for the construction of two sections of the a2 motorway between warsaw and lodz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are also cashing in in eu countries the project is funded by a 500-million euro loan from the european investment bank .
it is the first time that such a major eu construction project has been awarded to a chinese contractor .
the european construction industry federation -lrb- fiec -rrb- in brussels said covec underbid the construction costs by 30 percent from the next bidder .
for fiec , it 's a clear case of distorting competition .
it suspects the chinese state is providing direct and thus unfair help for covec and will probably bear any losses which may result .
" if our companies were also supported with 500 million dollars in state aid , we could also offer cheaper prices , " said ulrich paetzold , fiec 's director general .
" but our companies can simply not compete fairly with the people 's republic of china . "
oa said in its survey it suspected that the project is also to serve as a reference for similar invitations to tender in bulgaria , romania and hungary .
dubious financing the oa survey found that china was taking advantage of the current economic climate , using aggressive financing methods .
" china of course has used the economic crisis in western europe in order to win market shares , " said oa chairman klaus mangold .
" there 's nothing to say against affordable financing , when they are in some way economically comprehensible .
but this is not the case . "
the exim deal with serbia , for example , involved a loan of 145 million euros at three percent interest for a period of 15 years .
the normal market interest rate for such a project , however , is a minimum of six percent over a period of five years , oa said .
" this can not be justified at all as an interest rate orientated to international markets , " mangold said .
oa said in its survey that the chinese credit institutions ' risk assessment appeared to correlate directly with the strategic interests of the political leadership in beijing .
" the greater the political interest , the lower the guarantees required , " the committee said .
regulatory measures many eastern european countries have no qualms taking advantage of china 's financing methods .
even crisis-plagued greece is happy to have a strong investor in times when western backers are showing reservations in pumping money to athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china controls part of piraeus , greece 's largest seaport greece already in 2007 entered into a " strategic partnership " with china .
the chinese maritime freight group cosco took over control of part of the container port in piraeus in 2008 .
the thessaloniki port is next on the agenda .
greece is the ideal bridgehead for chinese trade to europe , said christos alexakis , head of invest in greece , the agency that promotes and facilitates private investment there .
not only does his country profit from chinese capital , he said .
" there 's also a significant psychological aspect which benefits us , " alexakis said .
" it is very encouraging to underline china 's decisiveness in its course of action in greece .
where other fear turbulence and back down , chinese companies such as cosco decide to set out and profit from a strategically important transport project in europe . "
but not everyone is as happy as alexakis about china 's involvement in europe .
last month , german chancellor angela merkel recommended limiting chinese access to eu government contracts .
calling for more transparency , she said it had to be clear how much chinese companies were being supported by state institutions and banks when competing for contracts with european firms .
fiec 's paetzold said regulations needed to be sharpened so that such dumping offers could be ruled out .
but dgap 's sandschneider said critics should be careful talking about the distortion of competition considering the amount of official backing available for various sectors in the eu .
" as long as this level of subsidies exists in the eu , it 's difficult to truly attack the fact that the chinese government is trying to position its companies globally and come to their aid to a degree that it could have an effect , " sandschneider said .
meanwhile , the chinese government has now undertaken its latest investment at the doorway to europe with a 28-billion dollar railway project in turkey .

but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .
but i think , although we can not be 100 percent sure that we 've seen everything , we 're reasonably confident that we have the broad outline of the picture .

news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .
the ever-present hesitancy of many smaller members to give up powers to brussels is also a factor in their opposition to the german-french plan .
british prime minister david cameron has also come out saying he would not support any major rewriting of the lisbon treaty .
puzzling behavior the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , said the plans by germany and france , europe 's two largest countries , would be an affront to european council president herman van rompuy , who has been called on to chair a special task force looking into eu economic governance .
" i ask myself if mr van rompuy can see the consequences here , " schulz said .
" he gets an order to detail important reforms , but before he can present anything france and germany say , ' no , we have already decided everything . " '
former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who now leads the liberal group in the european parliament , labeled germany 's backtrack on its original strict-sanctions goal as puzzling .
" i find this utterly incomprehensible , particularly from germany , " he said .
" for 10 months they have demanded stricter punishment , and then they move in the opposite direction . "
the summit opens thursday afternoon and is set to conclude friday .

the move has already been met with opposition from several member states . chancellor angela merkel has defended a german-french proposal to impose stiffer penalties on european union countries that breach the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
speaking to the lower house of parliament on the eve of an eu summit in brussels on thursday , chancellor merkel said that germany and france would insist on tougher financial rules , even if it meant amending the lisbon treaty , which regulates how the 27-member block operates .
" we need a new , robust framework .
it must be legally watertight and this will happen only with a change of the european treaties , " she said .
the stability and growth pact requires eurozone countries to maintain a budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross domestic product .
however , it has been criticized for lacking proper enforcement mechanisms .
collision course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are pushing for tighter rules - but not everyone in the eu agrees chancellor merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy are proposing the introduction of semi-automatic sanctions that could only be overruled by a majority vote of eu member states .
" it is true , german-french unity is not everything in europe , " merkel told the bundestag , but added that " without franco-german agreement , little would come of many things - that is true in this case too . "
but the eu is already on a collision course ahead of thursday 's summit , because some smaller members , like luxembourg , are strongly opposed to a proposal that would freeze a member country 's voting rights if it breached the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
new emergency fund the chancellor also said that germany would support the extension of the current 750-million-euro -lrb- one-trillion-dollar -rrb- eurozone rescue package when it expires in 2013 , but that would require changes to the lisbon treaty .
merkel was also calling for a new emergency eu fund that would rely less on contributions from taxpayers and require more involvement from private banks .
germany pays the lions ' share into the current fund .
merkel told the bundestag that such a bailout fund was necessary to help prevent future financial crises in the 16-member eurozone .
" today , we must provide a new and robust framework for coping with financial crises , " she said .
" this new framework must be legitimate and invulnerable , with no ifs or buts , in no uncertain terms . "
merkel added that this would only be possible with changes to the lisbon treaty .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .

pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 ' nazi-era foreign ministry began building alibi in late 1940s , ' historian says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministry officials already started working on an alibi in the late 1940s as co-author of a new book called " das amt und die vergangenheit " -lrb- " the office and the past " -rrb- , us historian peter hayes of northwestern university has gained insight into german diplomats involvement in nazi crimes . deutsche welle : one would have thought that 65 years after the end of world war ii everything had already been said about the involvement of the german foreign office in the nazi era .
but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .

but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .
but i think , although we can not be 100 percent sure that we 've seen everything , we 're reasonably confident that we have the broad outline of the picture .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 28.10.2010 crisis-ridden ivory coast prepares for overdue presidential elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past records make the october elections uncertain eight years after a military coup , ivory coast citizens are hoping to finally vote in a new president .
but the elections have been postponed so many times in the past , that nobody is holding their breath . ivory coast or côte d 'ivoire is essentially a country of two halves .
the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .
yet he says those who come are not search of political guidance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian president laurent gbagbo " we all support president gbagbo 's program , " he said .
“ and we are willing to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , defend his life and our civil society one way or another . "
soukrou 's views are echoed by customers in a public bar not far from the sorbonne .
they say they want president laurent gbagbo to continue in office and want to see an end to the french influence in their country .
not everybody 's darling but the president , who has been in office since 2000 is not everybody 's favorite .
one man in abidjan told deutsche welle that gbagbo is holding the country back .
" in terms of politics he does whatever he can to stay in power , " the man said .
" we have been supposed to have elections for the past five years , but it 's never happened because the president blocks everything . "
the current head of state will be up against 13 other candidates , the most important of which are henri konan bedié and alassane dramane ouattara .
the three of them have been fighting one another for power since the 1990s , and are considered the old boys of ivory coast politics .
their parties are well-organized and between them they own several newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian press newspapers they use for aggressive tactics in campaigns which often concentrate more on making accusations about their respective opponents than on any real political program .
and consequently some doubt the ballot will even happen .
one such is jean louis billon , head of the country 's chamber of trade and industry .
" if you add it all up , we have had more peace agreements here than were necessary to end world war ii , " billon told deutsche welle .
" i truly doubt that there is enough political will to end this crisis , because if we really wanted to have elections , we 'd have had them long ago ! "
simple wishes what he and most of the population of the nation would like to see is the voting in of a president that can lead them back to the position of economic strength they enjoyed before the 2002 coup .
at the top of the general wish list are education and employment . " the first victims of the crisis are business owners , the population and our young people , " billon said .
" we have eight million unemployed young people , that means eight million young people without a perspective and with nothing to do . "
bildunterschrift : a street in abidjan he describes it as an explosive situation .
and he is not the only one to feel it .
" if things go on like this , there will be an uprising .
prices are so high , we can hardly afford to keep ourselves , " mother of two , yeli , told deutsche welle .
" we 've had enough , we 're sick of it . "
like many others , she is furious with politicians for failing to tap into the country 's resources and allow it to be the flourishing west african nation of old .
new generation some observers , however , believe the resources are part of the current political status quo .
rebels in the north have secured access to diamonds , gold , ore and politicians across the spectrum benefit from the sale of cocoa .
against that backdrop , patrick n 'gouan , head of a collective of civil society groups , does n't hold out much hope for any grand post-electoral change in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillaume soro , prime minister of ivory coast " if the country is run like it is now after the elections , the crisis wo n't go away , " he told deutsche welle .
" it will just mean that the government and opposition share the riches while the rest of the population gets poorer . "
precisely that is what the people of the côte d 'ivoire , half of whom are under the age of 30 , do not want to see happen .
twenty-five year-old amadou traoré told deutsche welle that his country needs a new generation of politicians , leaders who look to the future rather than back into the past .
and if they are not forthcoming , he warned , there could well be more trouble on the horizon .
" i am certain that one day the young people will defend themselves against this elite , " he said .
" we have seen the events in niger , and i could imagine the same kind of development here . "

countries in eastern europe need capital , and china is willing to give it to them at unbeatable interest rates in order to achieve its geopolitical goals . the number of large-scale chinese projects in eastern european countries is growing , according to the committee on eastern european economic relations , ost-ausschuss der deutschen wirtschaf t -lrb- oa -rrb- .
this influential lobbying group for german industries involved in the region said such deals particularly focused on infrastructure .
according to an oa survey published earlier this month , chinese funding has enabled a slew of new ventures .
in serbia , the export-import bank of china -lrb- exim -rrb- has helped finance a 170-million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge project in belgrade .
china and croatia have agreed to build a new airport in zagreb , and a chinese industrial zone is to be constructed in bulgaria , near the capital sofia .
the china development bank has said it will help support the expansion of wind energy in romania , in addition to china 's plans to invest a total of some one billion euros in the romanian energy , agricultural and mining sectors .
in moldova , the china overseas engineering group -lrb- covec -rrb- is to conduct infrastructure projects with a total value of one billion euros - amounting to some 10 percent of moldova 's entire gdp .
eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from the german council on foreign relations dgap , said beijing is keen on securing resources and gaining access to markets in all of these countries .
but most importantly , china wants to gradually position itself strategically in the region , he said .
" such poor nations , which are easier to impress than other countries by the mass of chinese investment sums , are often grateful objects to enter into such policies , " sandschneider said .
distorting competition one project in particular has caused quite a stir .
last year , covec - the subsidiary of the state-owned chinese railway - won two public contracts in poland for the construction of two sections of the a2 motorway between warsaw and lodz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are also cashing in in eu countries the project is funded by a 500-million euro loan from the european investment bank .
it is the first time that such a major eu construction project has been awarded to a chinese contractor .
the european construction industry federation -lrb- fiec -rrb- in brussels said covec underbid the construction costs by 30 percent from the next bidder .
for fiec , it 's a clear case of distorting competition .
it suspects the chinese state is providing direct and thus unfair help for covec and will probably bear any losses which may result .
" if our companies were also supported with 500 million dollars in state aid , we could also offer cheaper prices , " said ulrich paetzold , fiec 's director general .
" but our companies can simply not compete fairly with the people 's republic of china . "
oa said in its survey it suspected that the project is also to serve as a reference for similar invitations to tender in bulgaria , romania and hungary .
dubious financing the oa survey found that china was taking advantage of the current economic climate , using aggressive financing methods .
" china of course has used the economic crisis in western europe in order to win market shares , " said oa chairman klaus mangold .
" there 's nothing to say against affordable financing , when they are in some way economically comprehensible .
but this is not the case . "
the exim deal with serbia , for example , involved a loan of 145 million euros at three percent interest for a period of 15 years .
the normal market interest rate for such a project , however , is a minimum of six percent over a period of five years , oa said .
" this can not be justified at all as an interest rate orientated to international markets , " mangold said .
oa said in its survey that the chinese credit institutions ' risk assessment appeared to correlate directly with the strategic interests of the political leadership in beijing .
" the greater the political interest , the lower the guarantees required , " the committee said .
regulatory measures many eastern european countries have no qualms taking advantage of china 's financing methods .
even crisis-plagued greece is happy to have a strong investor in times when western backers are showing reservations in pumping money to athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china controls part of piraeus , greece 's largest seaport greece already in 2007 entered into a " strategic partnership " with china .
the chinese maritime freight group cosco took over control of part of the container port in piraeus in 2008 .
the thessaloniki port is next on the agenda .
greece is the ideal bridgehead for chinese trade to europe , said christos alexakis , head of invest in greece , the agency that promotes and facilitates private investment there .
not only does his country profit from chinese capital , he said .
" there 's also a significant psychological aspect which benefits us , " alexakis said .
" it is very encouraging to underline china 's decisiveness in its course of action in greece .
where other fear turbulence and back down , chinese companies such as cosco decide to set out and profit from a strategically important transport project in europe . "
but not everyone is as happy as alexakis about china 's involvement in europe .
last month , german chancellor angela merkel recommended limiting chinese access to eu government contracts .
calling for more transparency , she said it had to be clear how much chinese companies were being supported by state institutions and banks when competing for contracts with european firms .
fiec 's paetzold said regulations needed to be sharpened so that such dumping offers could be ruled out .
but dgap 's sandschneider said critics should be careful talking about the distortion of competition considering the amount of official backing available for various sectors in the eu .
" as long as this level of subsidies exists in the eu , it 's difficult to truly attack the fact that the chinese government is trying to position its companies globally and come to their aid to a degree that it could have an effect , " sandschneider said .
meanwhile , the chinese government has now undertaken its latest investment at the doorway to europe with a 28-billion dollar railway project in turkey .

the number of attacks directed against europe , the us and russia itself is on the rise .
but so far the police are no match for the hackers . russia is considered a haven for cyber crime .
the country 's hackers are among the most professional in the world .
their tools are computers and the internet , which they skillfully use to spy , manipulate and rob bank accounts , attack websites or send spam e-mails .
the hackers are especially versatile when it comes to stealing data .
hundreds of attacks are registered daily from russia .
more than half of those are directed against the european union , canada and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : need 1,000 credit card details ?
for $ 400 they 're yours " they are a threat in particular to bank customers with more than 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- on their accounts and who use online banking , " said nikita kislizin , russian it specialist and editor-in-chief of the magazine " hacker . "
he said the target of such attacks were average internet users as well as financial institutions , corporations , media organizations and even security services .
russian hackers stole 100,000 euros from the accounts of us bank citibank in 1994 .
swedish bank nordea was targetted and lost around one million euros in 2007 .
the royal bank of scotland lost as much as seven million euros to hackers in 2008 .
and hackers are also busy attacking sites inside russia .
most of their capers are n't reported to the police or in the media , as most victims want to avoid public attention .
organized crime because high-speed internet connections are needed to carry out such activities , most of the country 's cyber criminals are said to live either in moscow or st. petersburg .
experts believe they are part of a highly organized back market .
the hackers meet with their clients in internet forums where services and prices can be discussed anonymously .
access to such a forum costs around $ 1,000 and requires a recommendation from at least three registered members .
the prices for various ' services ' are fixed .
bringing down a website costs around $ 300 per day .
for $ 400 a customer can obtain detailed data from 1,000 credit cards .
sending out a million spam e-mails costs about $ 200 .
should a job require a special skill set , the criminals often team up .
the annual turnover associated with illegal activities is estimated at around one billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through the internet hackers can access almost any computer in the world " they 're driving very big cars , " said yevgeny kaspersky , head of the internet security company kaspersky lab .
" money is their only goal , " he added .
it 's said that a gang of 10 hackers can earn around 10 million euros a year . in term of the necessary technology , the investment required is only around 20,000 euros .
and the hackers have reliable means of turning that dirty electronic money into clean cash .
the hackers spend at least 10 hours a day at the computer . they rarely take a weekend off .
should an attack require it , they will stay awake for days at a time .
and even if they 're not working on a deal , they still have to be online and check the latest anti-virus programs to see how they can be outsmarted .
the number of cyber criminals in russia is estimated at around 20,000 .
most are between 20 and 30 years old and are graduates of the country 's technical universities .
next to no fines police in russia lack both the personnel and the technology to effectively combat the hackers .
often , the authorities are simply powerless to deal with the attacks .
only around 10 percent of the crimes are ever solved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's police has little to match the hackers with also , the fight against cyber crime still is n't being made a top priority by police in russia .
there is no countrywide databank of computer-related crimes .
journalists from abroad are generally refused interviews with the branch of the russian police responsible for dealing with cyber crime .
not only that , but if a hacker does happen to get caught , he can usually expect to escape with a mild sentence .
victor pleshchuck was involved in the bank of scotland robbery .
in september 2010 he was sentenced to six years on probation and a fine .
" if you have someone in russia who earns more than a million dollars a year , he 's practically immune against prosecution , " said ilya sachkov , head of group-ib cyber crimes investigations , the only private security company trying to hunt down the hackers .
yevgeny kaspersky said it was the mindset that still needed to change .
" judges in russia just do n't get how big these crimes are - and how much money is involved . "

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .

recently , taiwan and china signed their largest free trade agreement ever and now there is talk of a " free travel " agreement . citizens from mainland china have been allowed to travel to taiwan since 2008 , but only on designated group tours and after tedious application and selection procedures .
negotiations about " ziyouxing " or " free travel " are now underway – this would allow tourists to come to taiwan on their own . wu zhengde from taiwan 's providence university says this could be possible as early as next year , but that it will start off as a trial run .
" in this concept there is also the question of numbers .
how many people are there and what are the capacities ?
and that is exactly the problem china is dealing with now .
we just have to work on the details and see if the existing structure will suffice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists love to visit taipei 101 , one of the world 's tallest skyscrapers wu believes both economies would benefit greatly from free travel , especially because an increasing number of people from the people ’ s republic want to travel to taiwan . tourism to taiwan is increasing by the day last year , the average number of mainland chinese traveling to taiwan each day was a little over 1,100 .
in the first half of 2010 alone , that number went up to 3,400 . with around 1.2 million visitors this year already , tourists from the chinese mainland constitute the largest chunk of taiwan 's tourism .
numbers will only grow when tourists are not restricted to group travel . but some , such as ru hongjin , believe this is a dangerous development .
he is currently running a survey for taiwan 's tourism bureau and thinks this is a further device china could use to bully taiwan at will . " it will damage the economy .
we ca n't treat china like any other country because other countries do n't have such a complex relationship with taiwan .
they will try to use the economy for their political purposes , " he says . ru is also worried that china is mainly concerned with making a good impression on taiwan but alice chen , a deputy director at the tourism bureau , does not see it that way . tourism can enhance communication she feels the main goal of tourism is to enhance communication and sees china 's interest in taiwan as genuine .
she says that tourists from the mainland like to watch taiwanese television shows , which are so different from their own , and get to know taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of taiwan 's national palace museum " we were separated for so many years , for decades , so they like to come and see everything , especially taipei 101 or the palace museum .
they have an itinerary of seven or eight days .
this means they go all over the island and try to see everything . " one of the taiwanese government 's largest fears is that too many people will come in illegally , which feeds into another stereotype : that the tour guides ' number one task is making sure the visitors do not run away . " actually they do bear some responsibility and we have to make sure they come to taiwan for purposes of tourism and not for other purposes .
if a chinese tourist goes missing , we will charge the travel agency 100,000 new taiwan dollars , " says alice chen . but surprisingly , the rate of runaway chinese tourists is low in taiwan .
on average just three out of 100,000 " go missing " on a tour .
for the taiwanese tourist industry , it is certainly a risk worth taking . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has already been met with opposition from several member states . chancellor angela merkel has defended a german-french proposal to impose stiffer penalties on european union countries that breach the criteria of the stability and growth pact .
speaking to the lower house of parliament on the eve of an eu summit in brussels on thursday , chancellor merkel said that germany and france would insist on tougher financial rules , even if it meant amending the lisbon treaty , which regulates how the 27-member block operates .
" we need a new , robust framework .
it must be legally watertight and this will happen only with a change of the european treaties , " she said .

his remarks came a day after a threat to france purported to be from al-qaeda leader osama bin laden was issued . a day after a direct threat was purportedly issued to france by al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , the country 's defense minister has said french troops could begin withdrawing from afghanistan from 2011 .
" there 's a fixed date for nato in the framework of its new strategy - that 's the start of 2011 , because in 2011 we 're going to transfer a whole series of districts to the afghans , " defense minister herve morin told rtl radio .
" at that moment , there could be the first movements or first withdrawals of allied forces from afghanistan .
in any case , that 's the calendar set by barack obama , that in 2011 the first american troops could quit afghanistan .
" and that 's what a certain number of european countries have started to say , " he explained , insisting that his comments were not related to the threat issued against france on wednesday by a voice claiming to be islamist militant osama bin laden .
asked whether the threat , contained in an audiotape broadcast by the arab satellite channel al-jazeera , was genuine , morin said : " we 're still in the course of trying to authenticate it .
it 's too soon to say . "
he added it was " not impossible " that such a tape existed and that " all of our services , and all of our allies believe osama bin laden is alive . "
audio threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western intelligence agencies believe bin laden is still alive the audio recording said france opened itself to retaliatory attacks by having sent troops into afghanistan and by having recently banned the islamic full-face veil .
" how could you take part in occupying our countries and support the americans in killing our children and women , and then expect to live in peace and security ? " the voice demanded .
" it is very simple : as you kill , you will be killed , as you take hostages , you will be taken hostage , and as you compromise our security , we will compromise your security , " the two-minute message said .
morin insisted that france 's decision to begin postulating an exit from afghanistan from next year had " absolutely no link " to the threat .
" radical islamist movements always invoke our presence in afghanistan ; it is a frequent demand , " he said .
french troops in afghanistan , which currently number at around 3,500 , have been on the ground since 2001 .
fifty french soldiers have died fighting the taliban and allied islamist insurgents , mainly in the hilly districts just east of the capital kabul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 28.10.2010 new digital german id cards arrive on november 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german id cards will be released november 1 new national id cards are coming to germany .
the new cards boast features designed to safeguard against the hazards of the internet age , including phishing and identity theft , but critics say there are still problems . national identification cards are nothing new to germans .
citizens have been required to show their id card or a passport to the authorities since 1939 , when the nazis first wrote it into law .
after world war ii , the various occupying powers kept the policy of national id cards for everyone over the age of 16 .
on november 1 , the german government is rolling out the latest incarnation of the german national id card , the so-called electronic id , or eid .
the new cards contain a microchip using radio frequency identification technology , or rfid .
this technology is already widely used in security systems for various buildings , as well as by retailers to inventory goods .
all citizens whose id cards are expiring this year can apply for new ones , as the government begins to phase them in .
" it 's an electronic means of identifying an item , in this case an id card , " said karsten nohl , an independent security expert , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the rfid capabilities of the new cards take the concept of identification further than current ids in germany , which are also used for international travel within the european union .
the cards can be used to identify the user on the internet , and even to authenticate digital signatures .
at first glance , these new ids do n't look different than the current analog cards .
they feature a photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance , just like the old ones .
but this data is also contained within the microchip in the card , and a digital biometric photograph of the cardholder .
reduced phishing the federal office for information security , better known by its german acronym , bsi , is developing the new cards . " we have a lot of features in the card which are very , very useful , " said manuel bach , the eid project manager .
" for example , the protection against phishing sites which are a big problem in germany and around the world , and we totally get rid of it using the germany id card . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club circumvented the eid 's security on television phishing websites often are set up to look like a legitimate online merchant in order to harvest personal or financial data .
bsi claims that eid card holders could use the card via a digital reader connected to their computer in order to detect when a website does n't have a correct security certificate .
another security measure on the card is the beefed-up encryption , which is based on elliptic curve cryptography and , according to bach , is essentially unbreakable .
chink in the armor hackers tend to agree that the encryption is not the weakness in the system .
the german hacker collective , the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , raked the new system over the coals in september when they went on television and hacked the new id using basic spyware .
but it was n't the card itself that made the hack so easy .
to take advantage of the online authentication perks for the computer , the card must be coupled with a peripheral card-reading piece of hardware .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model .
their hackers installed a keylogger on the user 's computer , enabling them to steal the pin and then rewrite data on the id card using that information .
it is disingenuous of the government to promote the new system as secure while such a hole exists , according to constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman .
“ if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , ” she said .
“ the hackers will always attack the weakest point and the weakest point is the user . ”
citizens need to protect themselves better bsi 's manuel bach agreed that the end-user was the weakest link in the chain , but demurred , saying that computers infected with trojan horses and other malware are already at risk of hemorrhaging data , even without the new id card .
" the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " bach said .
" so you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . "
despite this downside , security expert karsten nohl is convinced that the authentication and remote signature functions of the id are better than the alternatives .
" this , of course , promises much more security than some wobbly line of ink on a piece of paper , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with initiatives like stork , eids like germany 's could become very common leap of faith but nohl is not convinced that the system is being handled with all due care .
" people should n't start off using this card as if there 's nothing to steal from it , " nohl warned .
" once the card is stolen or can be emulated , any future application becomes vulnerable .
the awareness of future abuse potential has to be created today . "
concerns such as nohl 's and those of the ccc are underlined by the fact that the use of this style of identification is on the rise .
the european union is planning to launch a new initiative in 2011 called stork .
through this program , 17 participating european nations with electronic ids , including germany , would be able to cooperate across borders .
the program claims that in the future , users will be able to start a company , get a tax refund or obtain university admissions status online . author : stuart tiffen editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new cards boast features designed to safeguard against the hazards of the internet age , including phishing and identity theft , but critics say there are still problems . national identification cards are nothing new to germans .
citizens have been required to show their id card or a passport to the authorities since 1939 , when the nazis first wrote it into law .
after world war ii , the various occupying powers kept the policy of national id cards for everyone over the age of 16 .
on november 1 , the german government is rolling out the latest incarnation of the german national id card , the so-called electronic id , or eid .
the new cards contain a microchip using radio frequency identification technology , or rfid .
this technology is already widely used in security systems for various buildings , as well as by retailers to inventory goods .
all citizens whose id cards are expiring this year can apply for new ones , as the government begins to phase them in .
" it 's an electronic means of identifying an item , in this case an id card , " said karsten nohl , an independent security expert , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the rfid capabilities of the new cards take the concept of identification further than current ids in germany , which are also used for international travel within the european union .
the cards can be used to identify the user on the internet , and even to authenticate digital signatures .
at first glance , these new ids do n't look different than the current analog cards .
they feature a photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance , just like the old ones .
but this data is also contained within the microchip in the card , and a digital biometric photograph of the cardholder .
reduced phishing the federal office for information security , better known by its german acronym , bsi , is developing the new cards . " we have a lot of features in the card which are very , very useful , " said manuel bach , the eid project manager .
" for example , the protection against phishing sites which are a big problem in germany and around the world , and we totally get rid of it using the germany id card . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club circumvented the eid 's security on television phishing websites often are set up to look like a legitimate online merchant in order to harvest personal or financial data .
bsi claims that eid card holders could use the card via a digital reader connected to their computer in order to detect when a website does n't have a correct security certificate .
another security measure on the card is the beefed-up encryption , which is based on elliptic curve cryptography and , according to bach , is essentially unbreakable .
chink in the armor hackers tend to agree that the encryption is not the weakness in the system .
the german hacker collective , the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , raked the new system over the coals in september when they went on television and hacked the new id using basic spyware .
but it was n't the card itself that made the hack so easy .
to take advantage of the online authentication perks for the computer , the card must be coupled with a peripheral card-reading piece of hardware .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model .
their hackers installed a keylogger on the user 's computer , enabling them to steal the pin and then rewrite data on the id card using that information .
it is disingenuous of the government to promote the new system as secure while such a hole exists , according to constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman .
“ if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , ” she said .
“ the hackers will always attack the weakest point and the weakest point is the user . ”
citizens need to protect themselves better bsi 's manuel bach agreed that the end-user was the weakest link in the chain , but demurred , saying that computers infected with trojan horses and other malware are already at risk of hemorrhaging data , even without the new id card .
" the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " bach said .
" so you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . "
despite this downside , security expert karsten nohl is convinced that the authentication and remote signature functions of the id are better than the alternatives .
" this , of course , promises much more security than some wobbly line of ink on a piece of paper , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with initiatives like stork , eids like germany 's could become very common leap of faith but nohl is not convinced that the system is being handled with all due care .
" people should n't start off using this card as if there 's nothing to steal from it , " nohl warned .
" once the card is stolen or can be emulated , any future application becomes vulnerable .
the awareness of future abuse potential has to be created today . "
concerns such as nohl 's and those of the ccc are underlined by the fact that the use of this style of identification is on the rise .
the european union is planning to launch a new initiative in 2011 called stork .
through this program , 17 participating european nations with electronic ids , including germany , would be able to cooperate across borders .
the program claims that in the future , users will be able to start a company , get a tax refund or obtain university admissions status online . author : stuart tiffen editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .
the ever-present hesitancy of many smaller members to give up powers to brussels is also a factor in their opposition to the german-french plan .
british prime minister david cameron has also come out saying he would not support any major rewriting of the lisbon treaty .
puzzling behavior the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , said the plans by germany and france , europe 's two largest countries , would be an affront to european council president herman van rompuy , who has been called on to chair a special task force looking into eu economic governance .
" i ask myself if mr van rompuy can see the consequences here , " schulz said .
" he gets an order to detail important reforms , but before he can present anything france and germany say , ' no , we have already decided everything . " '
former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who now leads the liberal group in the european parliament , labeled germany 's backtrack on its original strict-sanctions goal as puzzling .
" i find this utterly incomprehensible , particularly from germany , " he said .
" for 10 months they have demanded stricter punishment , and then they move in the opposite direction . "
the summit opens thursday afternoon and is set to conclude friday .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

in the short time the law has been on the books , the government agency responsible for mediating legal disputes in the workplace has reported about 400 cases citing the new law .
that 's up to 15 reports per day , according to workplace legal consultant olga kicanovic , who works for the agency .
kicanovic told deutsche welle she was surprised how well-informed employees in serbia were over their legal rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic crisis has put employees who experience bullying in a tough spot " they sat there , even with the text of the law in their hands , and said , ' i have this problem that is defined in this paragraph of the law , " ' she said .
" i find that incredible , because most people do n't even read the traffic laws so closely . "
necessary protections workplace bullying can occur in all sectors of employment within a given company , kicanovic said , which is why reports of mistreatment have come as much from highly qualified as average-level employees .
there has also been little distinction between reports from private and public employers , she added .
attorney lena pelic said she welcomed both the theory behind and the application of the law .
" due to the economic crisis that is still affecting serbia , i believe employees really need protection , " she said .
" in recent years , people been exposed to several different forms of mistreatment at work . "
rush only temporary according to estimates by the serbian ministry for labor and social affairs , the huge number of claims is only temporary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law prescribes fines of up to 800,000 dinar " our foreign colleagues who already have experience with these kinds of laws warned that there would be numerous claims filed shortly after the law comes into effect , " said deputy labor minister radmila bukumiric katic .
" in about a year , these numbers are likely to level out at a much lower average . "
she added that in " definitely more than half of these reports " there has been no violation of the anti-bullying law , despite an employee 's claims .
unequal salaries , for example , are not covered under the law , katic said .
this has led critics to call for clarifications in a perceived vagueness of the law 's language .
criticism as unenforceable legal and human resource departments at various companies have also contacted the authorities for additional information on the law , which the government has given as evidence that employers are taking the law seriously .
all of the firms in serbia that deutsche welle contacted declined to comment on the law .
before the legislation came into effect , many critics dismissed it as practically unenforceable .
but lawmakers and government labor authorities defended it , saying it simplifies the mediation process and cuts it down to a month 's time .
as punishment , employers can be given fines of up to 800,000 dinar -lrb- 7,500 euros , $ 1,100 -rrb- .
serbia is the ninth european country to enact a law banning workplace bullying , following france , sweden , norway , finland , denmark , belgium , the netherlands and switzerland .

countries in eastern europe need capital , and china is willing to give it to them at unbeatable interest rates in order to achieve its geopolitical goals . the number of large-scale chinese projects in eastern european countries is growing , according to the committee on eastern european economic relations , ost-ausschuss der deutschen wirtschaf t -lrb- oa -rrb- .
this influential lobbying group for german industries involved in the region said such deals particularly focused on infrastructure .
according to an oa survey published earlier this month , chinese funding has enabled a slew of new ventures .
in serbia , the export-import bank of china -lrb- exim -rrb- has helped finance a 170-million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge project in belgrade .
china and croatia have agreed to build a new airport in zagreb , and a chinese industrial zone is to be constructed in bulgaria , near the capital sofia .
the china development bank has said it will help support the expansion of wind energy in romania , in addition to china 's plans to invest a total of some one billion euros in the romanian energy , agricultural and mining sectors .
in moldova , the china overseas engineering group -lrb- covec -rrb- is to conduct infrastructure projects with a total value of one billion euros - amounting to some 10 percent of moldova 's entire gdp .
eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from the german council on foreign relations dgap , said beijing is keen on securing resources and gaining access to markets in all of these countries .
but most importantly , china wants to gradually position itself strategically in the region , he said .
" such poor nations , which are easier to impress than other countries by the mass of chinese investment sums , are often grateful objects to enter into such policies , " sandschneider said .
distorting competition one project in particular has caused quite a stir .
last year , covec - the subsidiary of the state-owned chinese railway - won two public contracts in poland for the construction of two sections of the a2 motorway between warsaw and lodz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are also cashing in in eu countries the project is funded by a 500-million euro loan from the european investment bank .
it is the first time that such a major eu construction project has been awarded to a chinese contractor .
the european construction industry federation -lrb- fiec -rrb- in brussels said covec underbid the construction costs by 30 percent from the next bidder .
for fiec , it 's a clear case of distorting competition .
it suspects the chinese state is providing direct and thus unfair help for covec and will probably bear any losses which may result .
" if our companies were also supported with 500 million dollars in state aid , we could also offer cheaper prices , " said ulrich paetzold , fiec 's director general .
" but our companies can simply not compete fairly with the people 's republic of china . "
oa said in its survey it suspected that the project is also to serve as a reference for similar invitations to tender in bulgaria , romania and hungary .
dubious financing the oa survey found that china was taking advantage of the current economic climate , using aggressive financing methods .
" china of course has used the economic crisis in western europe in order to win market shares , " said oa chairman klaus mangold .
" there 's nothing to say against affordable financing , when they are in some way economically comprehensible .
but this is not the case . "
the exim deal with serbia , for example , involved a loan of 145 million euros at three percent interest for a period of 15 years .
the normal market interest rate for such a project , however , is a minimum of six percent over a period of five years , oa said .
" this can not be justified at all as an interest rate orientated to international markets , " mangold said .
oa said in its survey that the chinese credit institutions ' risk assessment appeared to correlate directly with the strategic interests of the political leadership in beijing .
" the greater the political interest , the lower the guarantees required , " the committee said .
regulatory measures many eastern european countries have no qualms taking advantage of china 's financing methods .
even crisis-plagued greece is happy to have a strong investor in times when western backers are showing reservations in pumping money to athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china controls part of piraeus , greece 's largest seaport greece already in 2007 entered into a " strategic partnership " with china .
the chinese maritime freight group cosco took over control of part of the container port in piraeus in 2008 .
the thessaloniki port is next on the agenda .
greece is the ideal bridgehead for chinese trade to europe , said christos alexakis , head of invest in greece , the agency that promotes and facilitates private investment there .
not only does his country profit from chinese capital , he said .
" there 's also a significant psychological aspect which benefits us , " alexakis said .
" it is very encouraging to underline china 's decisiveness in its course of action in greece .
where other fear turbulence and back down , chinese companies such as cosco decide to set out and profit from a strategically important transport project in europe . "
but not everyone is as happy as alexakis about china 's involvement in europe .
last month , german chancellor angela merkel recommended limiting chinese access to eu government contracts .
calling for more transparency , she said it had to be clear how much chinese companies were being supported by state institutions and banks when competing for contracts with european firms .
fiec 's paetzold said regulations needed to be sharpened so that such dumping offers could be ruled out .
but dgap 's sandschneider said critics should be careful talking about the distortion of competition considering the amount of official backing available for various sectors in the eu .
" as long as this level of subsidies exists in the eu , it 's difficult to truly attack the fact that the chinese government is trying to position its companies globally and come to their aid to a degree that it could have an effect , " sandschneider said .
meanwhile , the chinese government has now undertaken its latest investment at the doorway to europe with a 28-billion dollar railway project in turkey .

the new cards boast features designed to safeguard against the hazards of the internet age , including phishing and identity theft , but critics say there are still problems . national identification cards are nothing new to germans .
citizens have been required to show their id card or a passport to the authorities since 1939 , when the nazis first wrote it into law .
after world war ii , the various occupying powers kept the policy of national id cards for everyone over the age of 16 .
on november 1 , the german government is rolling out the latest incarnation of the german national id card , the so-called electronic id , or eid .
the new cards contain a microchip using radio frequency identification technology , or rfid .
this technology is already widely used in security systems for various buildings , as well as by retailers to inventory goods .
all citizens whose id cards are expiring this year can apply for new ones , as the government begins to phase them in .
" it 's an electronic means of identifying an item , in this case an id card , " said karsten nohl , an independent security expert , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the rfid capabilities of the new cards take the concept of identification further than current ids in germany , which are also used for international travel within the european union .
the cards can be used to identify the user on the internet , and even to authenticate digital signatures .
at first glance , these new ids do n't look different than the current analog cards .
they feature a photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance , just like the old ones .
but this data is also contained within the microchip in the card , and a digital biometric photograph of the cardholder .
reduced phishing the federal office for information security , better known by its german acronym , bsi , is developing the new cards . " we have a lot of features in the card which are very , very useful , " said manuel bach , the eid project manager .
" for example , the protection against phishing sites which are a big problem in germany and around the world , and we totally get rid of it using the germany id card . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club circumvented the eid 's security on television phishing websites often are set up to look like a legitimate online merchant in order to harvest personal or financial data .
bsi claims that eid card holders could use the card via a digital reader connected to their computer in order to detect when a website does n't have a correct security certificate .
another security measure on the card is the beefed-up encryption , which is based on elliptic curve cryptography and , according to bach , is essentially unbreakable .
chink in the armor hackers tend to agree that the encryption is not the weakness in the system .
the german hacker collective , the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , raked the new system over the coals in september when they went on television and hacked the new id using basic spyware .
but it was n't the card itself that made the hack so easy .
to take advantage of the online authentication perks for the computer , the card must be coupled with a peripheral card-reading piece of hardware .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model .
their hackers installed a keylogger on the user 's computer , enabling them to steal the pin and then rewrite data on the id card using that information .
it is disingenuous of the government to promote the new system as secure while such a hole exists , according to constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman .
“ if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , ” she said .
“ the hackers will always attack the weakest point and the weakest point is the user . ”
citizens need to protect themselves better bsi 's manuel bach agreed that the end-user was the weakest link in the chain , but demurred , saying that computers infected with trojan horses and other malware are already at risk of hemorrhaging data , even without the new id card .
" the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " bach said .
" so you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . "
despite this downside , security expert karsten nohl is convinced that the authentication and remote signature functions of the id are better than the alternatives .
" this , of course , promises much more security than some wobbly line of ink on a piece of paper , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with initiatives like stork , eids like germany 's could become very common leap of faith but nohl is not convinced that the system is being handled with all due care .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 28.10.2010 new digital german id cards arrive on november 1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german id cards will be released november 1 new national id cards are coming to germany .
the new cards boast features designed to safeguard against the hazards of the internet age , including phishing and identity theft , but critics say there are still problems . national identification cards are nothing new to germans .
citizens have been required to show their id card or a passport to the authorities since 1939 , when the nazis first wrote it into law .
after world war ii , the various occupying powers kept the policy of national id cards for everyone over the age of 16 .
on november 1 , the german government is rolling out the latest incarnation of the german national id card , the so-called electronic id , or eid .
the new cards contain a microchip using radio frequency identification technology , or rfid .
this technology is already widely used in security systems for various buildings , as well as by retailers to inventory goods .
all citizens whose id cards are expiring this year can apply for new ones , as the government begins to phase them in .
" it 's an electronic means of identifying an item , in this case an id card , " said karsten nohl , an independent security expert , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the rfid capabilities of the new cards take the concept of identification further than current ids in germany , which are also used for international travel within the european union .
the cards can be used to identify the user on the internet , and even to authenticate digital signatures .
at first glance , these new ids do n't look different than the current analog cards .
they feature a photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance , just like the old ones .
but this data is also contained within the microchip in the card , and a digital biometric photograph of the cardholder .
reduced phishing the federal office for information security , better known by its german acronym , bsi , is developing the new cards . " we have a lot of features in the card which are very , very useful , " said manuel bach , the eid project manager .
" for example , the protection against phishing sites which are a big problem in germany and around the world , and we totally get rid of it using the germany id card . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club circumvented the eid 's security on television phishing websites often are set up to look like a legitimate online merchant in order to harvest personal or financial data .
bsi claims that eid card holders could use the card via a digital reader connected to their computer in order to detect when a website does n't have a correct security certificate .
another security measure on the card is the beefed-up encryption , which is based on elliptic curve cryptography and , according to bach , is essentially unbreakable .
chink in the armor hackers tend to agree that the encryption is not the weakness in the system .
the german hacker collective , the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , raked the new system over the coals in september when they went on television and hacked the new id using basic spyware .
but it was n't the card itself that made the hack so easy .
to take advantage of the online authentication perks for the computer , the card must be coupled with a peripheral card-reading piece of hardware .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model .
their hackers installed a keylogger on the user 's computer , enabling them to steal the pin and then rewrite data on the id card using that information .
it is disingenuous of the government to promote the new system as secure while such a hole exists , according to constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman .
“ if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , ” she said .
“ the hackers will always attack the weakest point and the weakest point is the user . ”
citizens need to protect themselves better bsi 's manuel bach agreed that the end-user was the weakest link in the chain , but demurred , saying that computers infected with trojan horses and other malware are already at risk of hemorrhaging data , even without the new id card .
" the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " bach said .
" so you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . "
despite this downside , security expert karsten nohl is convinced that the authentication and remote signature functions of the id are better than the alternatives .
" this , of course , promises much more security than some wobbly line of ink on a piece of paper , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with initiatives like stork , eids like germany 's could become very common leap of faith but nohl is not convinced that the system is being handled with all due care .
" people should n't start off using this card as if there 's nothing to steal from it , " nohl warned .
" once the card is stolen or can be emulated , any future application becomes vulnerable .
the awareness of future abuse potential has to be created today . "
concerns such as nohl 's and those of the ccc are underlined by the fact that the use of this style of identification is on the rise .
the european union is planning to launch a new initiative in 2011 called stork .
through this program , 17 participating european nations with electronic ids , including germany , would be able to cooperate across borders .
the program claims that in the future , users will be able to start a company , get a tax refund or obtain university admissions status online . author : stuart tiffen editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new cards boast features designed to safeguard against the hazards of the internet age , including phishing and identity theft , but critics say there are still problems . national identification cards are nothing new to germans .
citizens have been required to show their id card or a passport to the authorities since 1939 , when the nazis first wrote it into law .
after world war ii , the various occupying powers kept the policy of national id cards for everyone over the age of 16 .
on november 1 , the german government is rolling out the latest incarnation of the german national id card , the so-called electronic id , or eid .
the new cards contain a microchip using radio frequency identification technology , or rfid .
this technology is already widely used in security systems for various buildings , as well as by retailers to inventory goods .
all citizens whose id cards are expiring this year can apply for new ones , as the government begins to phase them in .
" it 's an electronic means of identifying an item , in this case an id card , " said karsten nohl , an independent security expert , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the rfid capabilities of the new cards take the concept of identification further than current ids in germany , which are also used for international travel within the european union .
the cards can be used to identify the user on the internet , and even to authenticate digital signatures .
at first glance , these new ids do n't look different than the current analog cards .
they feature a photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance , just like the old ones .
but this data is also contained within the microchip in the card , and a digital biometric photograph of the cardholder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 28.10.2010 crisis-ridden ivory coast prepares for overdue presidential elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past records make the october elections uncertain eight years after a military coup , ivory coast citizens are hoping to finally vote in a new president .
but the elections have been postponed so many times in the past , that nobody is holding their breath . ivory coast or côte d 'ivoire is essentially a country of two halves .
the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .
yet he says those who come are not search of political guidance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian president laurent gbagbo " we all support president gbagbo 's program , " he said .
“ and we are willing to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , defend his life and our civil society one way or another . "
soukrou 's views are echoed by customers in a public bar not far from the sorbonne .
they say they want president laurent gbagbo to continue in office and want to see an end to the french influence in their country .
not everybody 's darling but the president , who has been in office since 2000 is not everybody 's favorite .
one man in abidjan told deutsche welle that gbagbo is holding the country back .
" in terms of politics he does whatever he can to stay in power , " the man said .
" we have been supposed to have elections for the past five years , but it 's never happened because the president blocks everything . "
the current head of state will be up against 13 other candidates , the most important of which are henri konan bedié and alassane dramane ouattara .
the three of them have been fighting one another for power since the 1990s , and are considered the old boys of ivory coast politics .
their parties are well-organized and between them they own several newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian press newspapers they use for aggressive tactics in campaigns which often concentrate more on making accusations about their respective opponents than on any real political program .
and consequently some doubt the ballot will even happen .
one such is jean louis billon , head of the country 's chamber of trade and industry .
" if you add it all up , we have had more peace agreements here than were necessary to end world war ii , " billon told deutsche welle .
" i truly doubt that there is enough political will to end this crisis , because if we really wanted to have elections , we 'd have had them long ago ! "
simple wishes what he and most of the population of the nation would like to see is the voting in of a president that can lead them back to the position of economic strength they enjoyed before the 2002 coup .
at the top of the general wish list are education and employment . " the first victims of the crisis are business owners , the population and our young people , " billon said .
" we have eight million unemployed young people , that means eight million young people without a perspective and with nothing to do . "
bildunterschrift : a street in abidjan he describes it as an explosive situation .
and he is not the only one to feel it .
" if things go on like this , there will be an uprising .
prices are so high , we can hardly afford to keep ourselves , " mother of two , yeli , told deutsche welle .
" we 've had enough , we 're sick of it . "
like many others , she is furious with politicians for failing to tap into the country 's resources and allow it to be the flourishing west african nation of old .
new generation some observers , however , believe the resources are part of the current political status quo .
rebels in the north have secured access to diamonds , gold , ore and politicians across the spectrum benefit from the sale of cocoa .
against that backdrop , patrick n 'gouan , head of a collective of civil society groups , does n't hold out much hope for any grand post-electoral change in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillaume soro , prime minister of ivory coast " if the country is run like it is now after the elections , the crisis wo n't go away , " he told deutsche welle .
" it will just mean that the government and opposition share the riches while the rest of the population gets poorer . "
precisely that is what the people of the côte d 'ivoire , half of whom are under the age of 30 , do not want to see happen .
twenty-five year-old amadou traoré told deutsche welle that his country needs a new generation of politicians , leaders who look to the future rather than back into the past .
and if they are not forthcoming , he warned , there could well be more trouble on the horizon .
" i am certain that one day the young people will defend themselves against this elite , " he said .
" we have seen the events in niger , and i could imagine the same kind of development here . "

but the elections have been postponed so many times in the past , that nobody is holding their breath . ivory coast or côte d 'ivoire is essentially a country of two halves .
the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .
yet he says those who come are not search of political guidance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian president laurent gbagbo " we all support president gbagbo 's program , " he said .
“ and we are willing to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , defend his life and our civil society one way or another . "
soukrou 's views are echoed by customers in a public bar not far from the sorbonne .
they say they want president laurent gbagbo to continue in office and want to see an end to the french influence in their country .
not everybody 's darling but the president , who has been in office since 2000 is not everybody 's favorite .
one man in abidjan told deutsche welle that gbagbo is holding the country back .
" in terms of politics he does whatever he can to stay in power , " the man said .
" we have been supposed to have elections for the past five years , but it 's never happened because the president blocks everything . "
the current head of state will be up against 13 other candidates , the most important of which are henri konan bedié and alassane dramane ouattara .
the three of them have been fighting one another for power since the 1990s , and are considered the old boys of ivory coast politics .
their parties are well-organized and between them they own several newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian press newspapers they use for aggressive tactics in campaigns which often concentrate more on making accusations about their respective opponents than on any real political program .
and consequently some doubt the ballot will even happen .
one such is jean louis billon , head of the country 's chamber of trade and industry .
" if you add it all up , we have had more peace agreements here than were necessary to end world war ii , " billon told deutsche welle .
" i truly doubt that there is enough political will to end this crisis , because if we really wanted to have elections , we 'd have had them long ago ! "
simple wishes what he and most of the population of the nation would like to see is the voting in of a president that can lead them back to the position of economic strength they enjoyed before the 2002 coup .
at the top of the general wish list are education and employment . " the first victims of the crisis are business owners , the population and our young people , " billon said .
" we have eight million unemployed young people , that means eight million young people without a perspective and with nothing to do . "
bildunterschrift : a street in abidjan he describes it as an explosive situation .
and he is not the only one to feel it .
" if things go on like this , there will be an uprising .
prices are so high , we can hardly afford to keep ourselves , " mother of two , yeli , told deutsche welle .
" we 've had enough , we 're sick of it . "
like many others , she is furious with politicians for failing to tap into the country 's resources and allow it to be the flourishing west african nation of old .
new generation some observers , however , believe the resources are part of the current political status quo .
rebels in the north have secured access to diamonds , gold , ore and politicians across the spectrum benefit from the sale of cocoa .
against that backdrop , patrick n 'gouan , head of a collective of civil society groups , does n't hold out much hope for any grand post-electoral change in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillaume soro , prime minister of ivory coast " if the country is run like it is now after the elections , the crisis wo n't go away , " he told deutsche welle .
" it will just mean that the government and opposition share the riches while the rest of the population gets poorer . "
precisely that is what the people of the côte d 'ivoire , half of whom are under the age of 30 , do not want to see happen .
twenty-five year-old amadou traoré told deutsche welle that his country needs a new generation of politicians , leaders who look to the future rather than back into the past .
and if they are not forthcoming , he warned , there could well be more trouble on the horizon .
" i am certain that one day the young people will defend themselves against this elite , " he said .
" we have seen the events in niger , and i could imagine the same kind of development here . "

but the elections have been postponed so many times in the past , that nobody is holding their breath . ivory coast or côte d 'ivoire is essentially a country of two halves .
the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .

the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .
yet he says those who come are not search of political guidance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian president laurent gbagbo " we all support president gbagbo 's program , " he said .
“ and we are willing to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , defend his life and our civil society one way or another . "
soukrou 's views are echoed by customers in a public bar not far from the sorbonne .
they say they want president laurent gbagbo to continue in office and want to see an end to the french influence in their country .
not everybody 's darling but the president , who has been in office since 2000 is not everybody 's favorite .
one man in abidjan told deutsche welle that gbagbo is holding the country back .
" in terms of politics he does whatever he can to stay in power , " the man said .
" we have been supposed to have elections for the past five years , but it 's never happened because the president blocks everything . "
the current head of state will be up against 13 other candidates , the most important of which are henri konan bedié and alassane dramane ouattara .
the three of them have been fighting one another for power since the 1990s , and are considered the old boys of ivory coast politics .
their parties are well-organized and between them they own several newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian press newspapers they use for aggressive tactics in campaigns which often concentrate more on making accusations about their respective opponents than on any real political program .
and consequently some doubt the ballot will even happen .
one such is jean louis billon , head of the country 's chamber of trade and industry .
" if you add it all up , we have had more peace agreements here than were necessary to end world war ii , " billon told deutsche welle .
" i truly doubt that there is enough political will to end this crisis , because if we really wanted to have elections , we 'd have had them long ago ! "
simple wishes what he and most of the population of the nation would like to see is the voting in of a president that can lead them back to the position of economic strength they enjoyed before the 2002 coup .
at the top of the general wish list are education and employment . " the first victims of the crisis are business owners , the population and our young people , " billon said .
" we have eight million unemployed young people , that means eight million young people without a perspective and with nothing to do . "

" if things go on like this , there will be an uprising .
prices are so high , we can hardly afford to keep ourselves , " mother of two , yeli , told deutsche welle .
" we 've had enough , we 're sick of it . "
like many others , she is furious with politicians for failing to tap into the country 's resources and allow it to be the flourishing west african nation of old .
new generation some observers , however , believe the resources are part of the current political status quo .
rebels in the north have secured access to diamonds , gold , ore and politicians across the spectrum benefit from the sale of cocoa .
against that backdrop , patrick n 'gouan , head of a collective of civil society groups , does n't hold out much hope for any grand post-electoral change in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillaume soro , prime minister of ivory coast " if the country is run like it is now after the elections , the crisis wo n't go away , " he told deutsche welle .
" it will just mean that the government and opposition share the riches while the rest of the population gets poorer . "
precisely that is what the people of the côte d 'ivoire , half of whom are under the age of 30 , do not want to see happen .
twenty-five year-old amadou traoré told deutsche welle that his country needs a new generation of politicians , leaders who look to the future rather than back into the past .
and if they are not forthcoming , he warned , there could well be more trouble on the horizon .

" pol pot was the prime minister of the khmer rouge .
he killed his own people , more than two out of seven million , " said un secretary-general ban ki-moon , as he was guided around the tuol sleng genocide museum at the tail end of his two-day official visit to cambodia . tuol sleng , the khmer rouge prison known as s-21 , was run by comrade duch , who was jailed earlier this year for 30 years by the un-backed war crimes tribunal in phnom penh . ban said duch 's conviction was a milestone in cambodia ’ s troubled history that had sent a powerful message to the world that crimes against humanity would not go unpunished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tuol sleng museum of genocidal crimes is housed in a former khmer rouge torture center " i will never forget my visit here today .
in this place of horror , ladies and gentlemen , let the human spirit triumph .
wars can not do justice , but we can .
thank you people of cambodia for leading the way . " bumpy ride overall overall , the un secretary-general 's visit was a bumpy one .
cambodia ’ s prime minister hun sen told him on wednesday that next year ’ s trial of four former khmer rouge leaders would be the court ’ s last . however , later the government appeared to backtrack , with the information minister saying that hun sen had only said he did not want more prosecutions – not that he would prevent them from going ahead . ban did not answer directly when asked what he understood hun sen ’ s final message to be .
" i had a good discussion on this matter twice with the prime minister hun sen , and also the deputy prime minister this morning , and i can tell you that the government of cambodia is committed to completion of the process .
the united nations will discuss this matter with the international community members , particularly donors .
that ’ s what i can tell you at this stage , " he said . ban 's spokesman later emailed clarification of that statement – in particular the phrase stating that the cambodian government is committed to completion of the judicial process .
he added it was for the court to decide independently which cases to pursue . human rights office might be shut down it seems less likely that mr ban will be able to counter hun sen ’ s demand to close the un ’ s human rights office here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon said that comrade duch 's conviction for war crimes was a milestone in cambodia 's troubled history " according to the memorandum of understanding , the un office of human rights in phnom penh has to work closely with the government to address human rights abuses , " said cambodian minister of information khieu kanharith . " but until now we have never had cooperation from this office .
we just get accusations .
this office acts like a mouthpiece for the opposition . " ban 's visit also ended controversially , when a group of residents facing eviction who had tried to protest peacefully near his final stop and to meet him personally , were attacked and beaten by police using electric shock batons and walkie-talkies . in an emailed statement , the deputy un high commissioner for human rights , kyung-wha kang , who is travelling with ban , said she had expressed her concern about the incident and the excessive use of force in person to the ministry of interior . she also said she had received a petition from the residents , although there was no word on whether she would meet them in his place . author : robert carmichael editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 28.10.2010 german parliament passes law to extend use of nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the life spans of nuclear plants was a campaign promise despite public protests and angry diatribes from the opposition , the german government on thursday took the first major hurdle in a parliamentary vote toward extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants . the bill passed comfortably 308 to 289 , but theoretically the government had 332 votes on its side .
the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

government expenditures will be slashed for the so-called family allowance and subsidies for " hartz iv " welfare recipients .
in addition , a new surcharge on air travel and a sharp increase in the tobacco tax have been approved .
business and industry will also face cuts in the subsidies to offset the environment tax on energy consumption .
the air travel surcharge next year will add between 8 and 45 euros to the price of an airplane ticket , depending on the destination .
the finance ministry expects to take in a billion euros annually from the air surcharge alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's majority ensured the drastic budget reforms were passed the tobacco tax is expected to raise an additional 200 million euros .
the wealthy will no longer receive the family allowance , if their incomes exceed 250,000 euros for singles and 500,000 for married couples .
the government expects savings of 3.5 billion euros next year , 5.4 billion in 2012 and nearly 5.7 billion in 2013 .
furthermore , banks face tougher risk management guidelines and will have to retain a larger amount of capital liquidity to cover potential defaults .
the opposition blasted the measures as a one-sided package that penalizes the poor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 28.10.2010 german parliament passes law to extend use of nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the life spans of nuclear plants was a campaign promise despite public protests and angry diatribes from the opposition , the german government on thursday took the first major hurdle in a parliamentary vote toward extending the lifespans of nuclear power plants . the bill passed comfortably 308 to 289 , but theoretically the government had 332 votes on its side .
the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .

other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .
the ever-present hesitancy of many smaller members to give up powers to brussels is also a factor in their opposition to the german-french plan .
british prime minister david cameron has also come out saying he would not support any major rewriting of the lisbon treaty .
puzzling behavior the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , said the plans by germany and france , europe 's two largest countries , would be an affront to european council president herman van rompuy , who has been called on to chair a special task force looking into eu economic governance .
" i ask myself if mr van rompuy can see the consequences here , " schulz said .
" he gets an order to detail important reforms , but before he can present anything france and germany say , ' no , we have already decided everything . " '
former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who now leads the liberal group in the european parliament , labeled germany 's backtrack on its original strict-sanctions goal as puzzling .
" i find this utterly incomprehensible , particularly from germany , " he said .
" for 10 months they have demanded stricter punishment , and then they move in the opposite direction . "
the summit opens thursday afternoon and is set to conclude friday .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

government expenditures will be slashed for the so-called family allowance and subsidies for " hartz iv " welfare recipients .
in addition , a new surcharge on air travel and a sharp increase in the tobacco tax have been approved .
business and industry will also face cuts in the subsidies to offset the environment tax on energy consumption .
the air travel surcharge next year will add between 8 and 45 euros to the price of an airplane ticket , depending on the destination .
the finance ministry expects to take in a billion euros annually from the air surcharge alone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's majority ensured the drastic budget reforms were passed the tobacco tax is expected to raise an additional 200 million euros .
the wealthy will no longer receive the family allowance , if their incomes exceed 250,000 euros for singles and 500,000 for married couples .
the government expects savings of 3.5 billion euros next year , 5.4 billion in 2012 and nearly 5.7 billion in 2013 .
furthermore , banks face tougher risk management guidelines and will have to retain a larger amount of capital liquidity to cover potential defaults .
the opposition blasted the measures as a one-sided package that penalizes the poor .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

a novel urban planning project is investing over two billion euros in an eco-friendly face-lift for one city in germany 's ruhr region .
five finalists are in the running - but there can be only one winner . the goal of the " innovationcity ruhr " project is n't to create a model green city from scratch .
its agenda is perhaps even more ambitious : it aims to take an existing city - with all of its industrial facilities , green spaces , swathes of fallow land and neighborhoods both old and new - and reshape it along more sustainable lines .
the competition was launched by the " initiativkreis ruhr , " an association of nearly 60 businesses , in the hope of encouraging the transition to the " green " economy of tomorrow .
at stake is a massive amount of investment - some 2.5 billion euros - which will be awarded to a city or district with an estimated population of 50,000 people on november 4 .
five finalists are looking to claim the " innovationcity ruhr " title , which would fund cutting-edge modernizations to the urban landscape aimed at slashing carbon emissions by half .
the decade-long series of renovations is seen as an opportunity to experiment on a massive scale with new technologies , building materials , forms of finance and ways of involving the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former ewald coal mine is now home to a hydrogen filling station driving innovation bochum , bottrop , essen , muelheim and gelsenkirchen / herten have been shortlisted for the competition , and these cities have taken their first steps to go green .
herten and the nearby city of gelsenkirchen , which joined forces for the application process , have pinned their hopes of winning on a high-tech hydrogen filling station .
based at the site of the former ewald coal mine , the location now provides hydrogen fuel for public transportation .
two buses are already running on fuel-cell technology , ferrying passengers between the cities of herten , bottrop and gladbeck . the gelsenkirchen / herten vision for the next 10 years involves a green transportation network , from fuel-cell-powered buses and cars to bicycles .
public utility companies are set to take on hydrogen production at the local level starting in 2011 - with the energy for this production phase coming from other sources of renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herten envisions a city of fuel-cell-powered vehicles the science of progress applicant cities have already found local partners in the business- and science-communities .
the fraunhofer institute for environmental , safety and energy technology -lrb- umsicht -rrb- is involved in coming up with ways to save on heat in bottrop .
scientists there worked to develop a system that uses excess warmth from mining waste to heat buildings .
stone that is brought up from more than 1,000 meters below ground during the mining process retains a great deal of heat .
josef robert of umsicht said the plan involves depositing the warm rock in bottrop 's schoettelheide mining dump .
" each day , it 's filled with 15,000 cubic meters , and that 's enough to heat a lot of homes , " he told deutsche welle .
another key component is the heat exchange system installed on the floor of the mining dump .
" the heat is transferred to the houses , and normally you need a heat pump there to turn up the temperature again , " robert said . disused mining facilities can also be repurposed to generate energy .
this includes plans for a 64-hectare solar power facility at the site .
the sun 's energy is a cost-effective source of power - but there 's still the expense of installing service lines from the facility .
money matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef robert from umsicht described the energy efficient heating project the move to transform city landscapes has one major sticking point : who pays the cost ?
herten 's mayor uli paetzel said the project involves a number of stakeholders .
" the large companies that jump-started the project and belong to the " initiativkreis ruhrgebiet " will contribute their share , " he said .
" private investment will follow , public investment , subsidies get added to it , and we want to use that to create innovative models . "
this includes new approaches to contracting and creating foundations and cooperatives .
paetzel underscored that taxpayers would not have to shoulder the costs , saying the focus was on providing them with attractive financing options .
under the scheme , energy prices for consumers would remain the same , and the savings generated through new technologies and efficiency-gains would be used to pay back the investors who financed the project .
" that 's basically the idea that we have , " paetzel told deutsche welle .
the effort hinges on local participation , but some residents worry that the updates will lead to rent increases , meaning they could no longer afford to live in the neighborhoods they call home .
to counter those fears , municipalities still in the running for the competition are trying to win over the hearts and minds of the public .
in bottrop , the city has collected some 20,000 signatures .
essen is organizing a street campaign , and bochum has scheduled town hall meetings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herten mayor uli paetzel says the focus is on innovative ways of raising funds low-carbon shopping but some innovations started even before the competition began .
in 2008 , muelheim became the first city in germany with a carbon-neutral supermarket .
two years ago , the retailer tengelmann renovated one of the company 's older stores , which was originally built in the 1980s .
this meant putting a photovoltaic system on the roof , drawing on geothermal power , and installing wind turbines and led lamps , as well as sensors that regulate lighting and ventilation .
the company also seized upon tried-and-true methods to get the job done .
tengelmann spokeswoman jutta meister said a simple invention , glass doors , can save a lot of energy .
the store put its meats , cheeses and perishables behind glass to prevent cool air from escaping .
" even the back of the service counters are equipped with sliding doors so that no cold air escapes , " she said , adding that it 's a bit of a hindrance for the staff but saves energy . the excess warmth generated by the refrigerated counters heats the supermarket – so well so that the geothermal power system was hardly necessary .
tengelmann plans to incorporate the lessons learned in mülheim for future renovations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tengelmann utilized solar and geothermal power for its market in muelheim a winning approach despite the cities ' efforts to implement ecologically friendly technologies , one question remains : what happens to these ideas and initiatives in cities that do n't win the " innovationcity ruhr " prize ?
many municipalities in the area are cash-strapped , but the competition 's finalists have agreed to push forward with modernization projects , win or lose .
without the extra funding , their projects might not be as ambitious or happen as quickly , but bottrop 's head of city planning christina kleinheins said the application process has already paid off . " we 've brought together all these projects and ideas and have already started to create a network between different companies and city administration , " she said .
" and that will certainly continue . "

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

'
ahead of december 's presidential ballot in belarus , free elections in the country are an ongoing concern .
olga karatch talked with deutsche welle about the push for democracy . olga karatch is a young civil rights activist and lawyer in belarus .
she runs a human rights network called " nash dom " and is the publisher of one of the largest independent weekly newspapers in belarus , " vitebsk kurier . "
karatch has been jailed several times because of her political activities – not uncommon in belarus , where politically active students are expelled from universities and their relatives are threatened .
the german city of radebeul recently awarded karatch its " courage prize , " promising solidarity and support in her push for freedom in belarus .
peter zimmermann spoke with karatch in radebeul .
deutsche welle : olga , you have created a network in belarus called " nash dom , " which if i 'm not mistaken means " our house . "
why did you choose the name ?
what 's wrong with the house ?
olga karatch : it was created at the end of 2005 before the last presidential elections , and the common idea was that belarus is our common house , and we have to be owners in our country , and we have to be decision-makers .
because it 's a very strange situation now , but nobody decides in belarus except one person about everything ... about governmental budget , about post of main editors , of governmental newspapers , judges , chiefs of local government , members of parliament , members of city councils and many , many other things .
and so for us ... it 's some questions : the first question is local self-management – how people can be decision-makers at the local level .
and , of course , in the case for us , it 's very interesting to know more about how government spends money .
the second question is about free elections , because we think that it 's impossible that the government decides who will be members of local councils , national parliament – and of course , who would be a president , of course .
and very important for us is the question about free mass media .
because if we want to change something , we need communication , places to speak with people .
to speak with potential voters or potential supporters of ours .
and , of course , now we have several independent newspapers , which work with us very closely .
our own newspaper , of course , is called " our house , " it 's not surprising -lrb- laughs -rrb- ... very easy .
but we have 150,000 copies per month .
so this is the biggest independent newspaper in belarus .
we distribute the newspaper free in post-boxes and have a special network of our volunteers who distribute it .
i 'm glad to see that you have n't lost your sense of humor with all the criticism you have .
you have networked something like 15 cities , and you are a lawyer yourself , a political scientist , a whole lot of other things , you publish an independent weekly newspaper – what exactly does your organization do for the people ?
we help people to partake themselves .
we organize advocacy campaigns .
we are interested in everything where we can find the conflict between government and citizen .
many people can not use the law .
especially against authority .
because if they try to say , " ok , my child is ill , and i need some help from government , " but the government is very aggressive if you ask about help … we have the situations when a mother goes to a doctor and says , " i need help for my child , " and afterwards she has problems in her job because the doctor calls to boss and says , " oh , this woman is very active .
you have to do something with her . "
and you know – even for these very small questions .
if you say about political questions , of course the situation is much , much , much harder .
and we had horrible situations in our organizations when , for example , the kgb stole our activists in the street and put them into a crazy-house -lsb- mental hospital -rsb- , and used some medicines , such as in the soviet union .
it 's a reality in belarus , you know .
if authorities threaten you that badly , they threaten others who fight for their liberty .
what do you say to these people to encourage them ?
they are scared .
yeah .
but the rain can not go on forever , you know -lrb- laughs -rrb- .
the system can be broken only if we fight .
and we have a lot of victories , to be honest .
i understand one thing : nobody can feel the pressure of the system alone .
if you feel the pressure , you could be broken if you are alone .
it 's impossible .
because the system is so strong .
but if we are together , if we help each other , if we build a network and protect each other and feel our solidarity , it 's possible .
and we can win in this case .
you were awarded the courage prize of the city of radebeul for your courage .
what would you say to people all over the world – in the usa , in western europe , in africa , asia – about the situation in belarus and your government ?
is there any kind of help you would ask for ?
is there something you would want them to do ?
we need solidarity .
it 's very important for us .
and when people fight and have so many risks to be in prison , to be stolen , to be under stress , to lose job and many other problems . we need solidarity .
we want to know that we are not alone .
we want to be a part of a european family , and we believe that democracy can go to belarus .
because so many people await it .

but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .
when there was an outcry against what he did , his response was to appoint a commission to look at the history of the foreign office and draw up a balance sheet of what actually had happened and had not happened and why an examination of what had happened had not been thorough in the postwar years .
that 's where we came in , and we 've done that now .
now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .
bildunterschrift : foreign minister guido westerwelle -lrb- center -rrb- , receives a report by peter hayes -lrb- from left -rrb- , eckart conze , moshe zimmermann , and norbert frei about the foreign office 's nazi past the head of the commission that compiled the study , german professor eckart conze , told the media that he considered the foreign office at the time a criminal organization .
other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .
as a result , you have people in charge of the archives who have a conflict of interest , if you will .
they have double obligations .
they are officials of the diplomatic service , and on the other hand they are archivists .
this produces very difficult tensions .
we had a couple of difficulties in obtaining certain records .
we were not informed of the existence of some records .
we had to find out about them and then ask directly for them .
there were a few moments where it came to extremely vigorous conversations with the archive staff .
but i think , although we can not be 100 percent sure that we 've seen everything , we 're reasonably confident that we have the broad outline of the picture .

but train and plane travel continued to be disrupted . hundreds of thousands of french strikers took to the streets on thursday in a desperate last ditch bid to force president nicolas sarkozy to scrap a just-passed law raising the retirement age .
" what 's impressive is that this is doubtless the first time that the day after a law is voted we have had such large demonstrations , " said the head of the cgt union bernard thibault .
although he did admit that there were fewer participants on thursday than in previous protests .
officials said that fewer than 200,000 had taken part by midday in what was a ninth one-day protest , compared to 480,000 on october 19 . jean-claude mailly , head of the force ouvriere trade union acknowledged that the protest movement was losing some of its previous punch . the protest movement was starting to show " a little fatigue " , he said on france 2 television . travel disruptions thursday 's protests came after france 's national assembly approved the final draft of pension reform legislation on wednesday .
the strikes were a last ditch bid to persuade president nicolas sarkozy not to enact the bill .
the strikes disrupted rail and air transport in france on thursday .
flights in and out of french airports were reduced by 30 to 50 percent due to a one-day stoppage by air traffic controllers , and a rolling strike by rail workers halved some services but caused less disruption than previously to high-speed links .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike at fos sur mer is expected to become sarkozy 's next main focus work stoppages that began on october 12 to protest against the pension reform have forced the closure of petrol refineries and disrupted the country 's transport network and cost france an estimated three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.17 billion -rrb- . a separate month-old strike at the port of fos-lavera near the southern city of marseille may now become the government 's main focus .
it is starving many french refineries of crude oil even after workers at several of them voted to resume work after weeks of being off the job .
petrol station shortages have eased after the government cleared fuel depot blockades and increased imports in recent days .
a necessary evil president nicolas sarkozy refused to back down over his flagship pensions reform after unions mounted wave after wave of strikes and nationwide street rallies in the past two months .
sarkozy says the legislation to raise the minimum and full retirement ages by two years to 62 and 67 is vital to rein in a ballooning pension shortfall and safeguard the aaa credit rating that lets france service its debt at the lowest market rates .
the government 's controversial pension reform , though passed by france 's national assembly , still needs to be reviewed by the constitutional council where a last-minute challenge by the opposition socialists could mean a delay of a few days but is not expected to overturn it .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

but the elections have been postponed so many times in the past , that nobody is holding their breath . ivory coast or côte d 'ivoire is essentially a country of two halves .
the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .
yet he says those who come are not search of political guidance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian president laurent gbagbo " we all support president gbagbo 's program , " he said .
“ and we are willing to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , defend his life and our civil society one way or another . "
soukrou 's views are echoed by customers in a public bar not far from the sorbonne .
they say they want president laurent gbagbo to continue in office and want to see an end to the french influence in their country .
not everybody 's darling but the president , who has been in office since 2000 is not everybody 's favorite .
one man in abidjan told deutsche welle that gbagbo is holding the country back .
" in terms of politics he does whatever he can to stay in power , " the man said .
" we have been supposed to have elections for the past five years , but it 's never happened because the president blocks everything . "
the current head of state will be up against 13 other candidates , the most important of which are henri konan bedié and alassane dramane ouattara .
the three of them have been fighting one another for power since the 1990s , and are considered the old boys of ivory coast politics .
their parties are well-organized and between them they own several newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian press newspapers they use for aggressive tactics in campaigns which often concentrate more on making accusations about their respective opponents than on any real political program .
and consequently some doubt the ballot will even happen .
one such is jean louis billon , head of the country 's chamber of trade and industry .
" if you add it all up , we have had more peace agreements here than were necessary to end world war ii , " billon told deutsche welle .
" i truly doubt that there is enough political will to end this crisis , because if we really wanted to have elections , we 'd have had them long ago ! "
simple wishes what he and most of the population of the nation would like to see is the voting in of a president that can lead them back to the position of economic strength they enjoyed before the 2002 coup .
at the top of the general wish list are education and employment . " the first victims of the crisis are business owners , the population and our young people , " billon said .
" we have eight million unemployed young people , that means eight million young people without a perspective and with nothing to do . "
bildunterschrift : a street in abidjan he describes it as an explosive situation .
and he is not the only one to feel it .
" if things go on like this , there will be an uprising .
prices are so high , we can hardly afford to keep ourselves , " mother of two , yeli , told deutsche welle .
" we 've had enough , we 're sick of it . "
like many others , she is furious with politicians for failing to tap into the country 's resources and allow it to be the flourishing west african nation of old .
new generation some observers , however , believe the resources are part of the current political status quo .
rebels in the north have secured access to diamonds , gold , ore and politicians across the spectrum benefit from the sale of cocoa .
against that backdrop , patrick n 'gouan , head of a collective of civil society groups , does n't hold out much hope for any grand post-electoral change in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillaume soro , prime minister of ivory coast " if the country is run like it is now after the elections , the crisis wo n't go away , " he told deutsche welle .
" it will just mean that the government and opposition share the riches while the rest of the population gets poorer . "
precisely that is what the people of the côte d 'ivoire , half of whom are under the age of 30 , do not want to see happen .
twenty-five year-old amadou traoré told deutsche welle that his country needs a new generation of politicians , leaders who look to the future rather than back into the past .
and if they are not forthcoming , he warned , there could well be more trouble on the horizon .
" i am certain that one day the young people will defend themselves against this elite , " he said .
" we have seen the events in niger , and i could imagine the same kind of development here . "

government expenditures will be slashed for the so-called family allowance and subsidies for " hartz iv " welfare recipients .
in addition , a new surcharge on air travel and a sharp increase in the tobacco tax have been approved .
business and industry will also face cuts in the subsidies to offset the environment tax on energy consumption .
the air travel surcharge next year will add between 8 and 45 euros to the price of an airplane ticket , depending on the destination .
the finance ministry expects to take in a billion euros annually from the air surcharge alone .

the government expects savings of 3.5 billion euros next year , 5.4 billion in 2012 and nearly 5.7 billion in 2013 .
furthermore , banks face tougher risk management guidelines and will have to retain a larger amount of capital liquidity to cover potential defaults .
the opposition blasted the measures as a one-sided package that penalizes the poor .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

countries in eastern europe need capital , and china is willing to give it to them at unbeatable interest rates in order to achieve its geopolitical goals . the number of large-scale chinese projects in eastern european countries is growing , according to the committee on eastern european economic relations , ost-ausschuss der deutschen wirtschaf t -lrb- oa -rrb- .
this influential lobbying group for german industries involved in the region said such deals particularly focused on infrastructure .
according to an oa survey published earlier this month , chinese funding has enabled a slew of new ventures .
in serbia , the export-import bank of china -lrb- exim -rrb- has helped finance a 170-million euro -lrb- $ 235 million -rrb- bridge project in belgrade .
china and croatia have agreed to build a new airport in zagreb , and a chinese industrial zone is to be constructed in bulgaria , near the capital sofia .
the china development bank has said it will help support the expansion of wind energy in romania , in addition to china 's plans to invest a total of some one billion euros in the romanian energy , agricultural and mining sectors .
in moldova , the china overseas engineering group -lrb- covec -rrb- is to conduct infrastructure projects with a total value of one billion euros - amounting to some 10 percent of moldova 's entire gdp .
eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from the german council on foreign relations dgap , said beijing is keen on securing resources and gaining access to markets in all of these countries .
but most importantly , china wants to gradually position itself strategically in the region , he said .
" such poor nations , which are easier to impress than other countries by the mass of chinese investment sums , are often grateful objects to enter into such policies , " sandschneider said .
distorting competition one project in particular has caused quite a stir .
last year , covec - the subsidiary of the state-owned chinese railway - won two public contracts in poland for the construction of two sections of the a2 motorway between warsaw and lodz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese companies are also cashing in in eu countries the project is funded by a 500-million euro loan from the european investment bank .
it is the first time that such a major eu construction project has been awarded to a chinese contractor .
the european construction industry federation -lrb- fiec -rrb- in brussels said covec underbid the construction costs by 30 percent from the next bidder .
for fiec , it 's a clear case of distorting competition .
it suspects the chinese state is providing direct and thus unfair help for covec and will probably bear any losses which may result .
" if our companies were also supported with 500 million dollars in state aid , we could also offer cheaper prices , " said ulrich paetzold , fiec 's director general .
" but our companies can simply not compete fairly with the people 's republic of china . "
oa said in its survey it suspected that the project is also to serve as a reference for similar invitations to tender in bulgaria , romania and hungary .
dubious financing the oa survey found that china was taking advantage of the current economic climate , using aggressive financing methods .
" china of course has used the economic crisis in western europe in order to win market shares , " said oa chairman klaus mangold .
" there 's nothing to say against affordable financing , when they are in some way economically comprehensible .
but this is not the case . "
the exim deal with serbia , for example , involved a loan of 145 million euros at three percent interest for a period of 15 years .
the normal market interest rate for such a project , however , is a minimum of six percent over a period of five years , oa said .
" this can not be justified at all as an interest rate orientated to international markets , " mangold said .
oa said in its survey that the chinese credit institutions ' risk assessment appeared to correlate directly with the strategic interests of the political leadership in beijing .
" the greater the political interest , the lower the guarantees required , " the committee said .
regulatory measures many eastern european countries have no qualms taking advantage of china 's financing methods .
even crisis-plagued greece is happy to have a strong investor in times when western backers are showing reservations in pumping money to athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china controls part of piraeus , greece 's largest seaport greece already in 2007 entered into a " strategic partnership " with china .
the chinese maritime freight group cosco took over control of part of the container port in piraeus in 2008 .
the thessaloniki port is next on the agenda .
greece is the ideal bridgehead for chinese trade to europe , said christos alexakis , head of invest in greece , the agency that promotes and facilitates private investment there .
not only does his country profit from chinese capital , he said .
" there 's also a significant psychological aspect which benefits us , " alexakis said .
" it is very encouraging to underline china 's decisiveness in its course of action in greece .
where other fear turbulence and back down , chinese companies such as cosco decide to set out and profit from a strategically important transport project in europe . "
but not everyone is as happy as alexakis about china 's involvement in europe .
last month , german chancellor angela merkel recommended limiting chinese access to eu government contracts .
calling for more transparency , she said it had to be clear how much chinese companies were being supported by state institutions and banks when competing for contracts with european firms .
fiec 's paetzold said regulations needed to be sharpened so that such dumping offers could be ruled out .
but dgap 's sandschneider said critics should be careful talking about the distortion of competition considering the amount of official backing available for various sectors in the eu .
" as long as this level of subsidies exists in the eu , it 's difficult to truly attack the fact that the chinese government is trying to position its companies globally and come to their aid to a degree that it could have an effect , " sandschneider said .
meanwhile , the chinese government has now undertaken its latest investment at the doorway to europe with a 28-billion dollar railway project in turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 28.10.2010 crisis-ridden ivory coast prepares for overdue presidential elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past records make the october elections uncertain eight years after a military coup , ivory coast citizens are hoping to finally vote in a new president .
but the elections have been postponed so many times in the past , that nobody is holding their breath . ivory coast or côte d 'ivoire is essentially a country of two halves .
the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .
yet he says those who come are not search of political guidance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian president laurent gbagbo " we all support president gbagbo 's program , " he said .
“ and we are willing to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , defend his life and our civil society one way or another . "
soukrou 's views are echoed by customers in a public bar not far from the sorbonne .
they say they want president laurent gbagbo to continue in office and want to see an end to the french influence in their country .
not everybody 's darling but the president , who has been in office since 2000 is not everybody 's favorite .
one man in abidjan told deutsche welle that gbagbo is holding the country back .
" in terms of politics he does whatever he can to stay in power , " the man said .
" we have been supposed to have elections for the past five years , but it 's never happened because the president blocks everything . "
the current head of state will be up against 13 other candidates , the most important of which are henri konan bedié and alassane dramane ouattara .
the three of them have been fighting one another for power since the 1990s , and are considered the old boys of ivory coast politics .
their parties are well-organized and between them they own several newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian press newspapers they use for aggressive tactics in campaigns which often concentrate more on making accusations about their respective opponents than on any real political program .
and consequently some doubt the ballot will even happen .
one such is jean louis billon , head of the country 's chamber of trade and industry .
" if you add it all up , we have had more peace agreements here than were necessary to end world war ii , " billon told deutsche welle .
" i truly doubt that there is enough political will to end this crisis , because if we really wanted to have elections , we 'd have had them long ago ! "
simple wishes what he and most of the population of the nation would like to see is the voting in of a president that can lead them back to the position of economic strength they enjoyed before the 2002 coup .
at the top of the general wish list are education and employment . " the first victims of the crisis are business owners , the population and our young people , " billon said .
" we have eight million unemployed young people , that means eight million young people without a perspective and with nothing to do . "
bildunterschrift : a street in abidjan he describes it as an explosive situation .
and he is not the only one to feel it .
" if things go on like this , there will be an uprising .
prices are so high , we can hardly afford to keep ourselves , " mother of two , yeli , told deutsche welle .
" we 've had enough , we 're sick of it . "
like many others , she is furious with politicians for failing to tap into the country 's resources and allow it to be the flourishing west african nation of old .
new generation some observers , however , believe the resources are part of the current political status quo .
rebels in the north have secured access to diamonds , gold , ore and politicians across the spectrum benefit from the sale of cocoa .
against that backdrop , patrick n 'gouan , head of a collective of civil society groups , does n't hold out much hope for any grand post-electoral change in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillaume soro , prime minister of ivory coast " if the country is run like it is now after the elections , the crisis wo n't go away , " he told deutsche welle .
" it will just mean that the government and opposition share the riches while the rest of the population gets poorer . "
precisely that is what the people of the côte d 'ivoire , half of whom are under the age of 30 , do not want to see happen .
twenty-five year-old amadou traoré told deutsche welle that his country needs a new generation of politicians , leaders who look to the future rather than back into the past .
and if they are not forthcoming , he warned , there could well be more trouble on the horizon .
" i am certain that one day the young people will defend themselves against this elite , " he said .
" we have seen the events in niger , and i could imagine the same kind of development here . "

the number of attacks directed against europe , the us and russia itself is on the rise .
but so far the police are no match for the hackers . russia is considered a haven for cyber crime .
the country 's hackers are among the most professional in the world .
their tools are computers and the internet , which they skillfully use to spy , manipulate and rob bank accounts , attack websites or send spam e-mails .
the hackers are especially versatile when it comes to stealing data .
hundreds of attacks are registered daily from russia .
more than half of those are directed against the european union , canada and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : need 1,000 credit card details ?
for $ 400 they 're yours " they are a threat in particular to bank customers with more than 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- on their accounts and who use online banking , " said nikita kislizin , russian it specialist and editor-in-chief of the magazine " hacker . "
he said the target of such attacks were average internet users as well as financial institutions , corporations , media organizations and even security services .
russian hackers stole 100,000 euros from the accounts of us bank citibank in 1994 .
swedish bank nordea was targetted and lost around one million euros in 2007 .
the royal bank of scotland lost as much as seven million euros to hackers in 2008 .
and hackers are also busy attacking sites inside russia .
most of their capers are n't reported to the police or in the media , as most victims want to avoid public attention .
organized crime because high-speed internet connections are needed to carry out such activities , most of the country 's cyber criminals are said to live either in moscow or st. petersburg .
experts believe they are part of a highly organized back market .
the hackers meet with their clients in internet forums where services and prices can be discussed anonymously .
access to such a forum costs around $ 1,000 and requires a recommendation from at least three registered members .
the prices for various ' services ' are fixed .
bringing down a website costs around $ 300 per day .
for $ 400 a customer can obtain detailed data from 1,000 credit cards .
sending out a million spam e-mails costs about $ 200 .
should a job require a special skill set , the criminals often team up .
the annual turnover associated with illegal activities is estimated at around one billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through the internet hackers can access almost any computer in the world " they 're driving very big cars , " said yevgeny kaspersky , head of the internet security company kaspersky lab .
" money is their only goal , " he added .
it 's said that a gang of 10 hackers can earn around 10 million euros a year . in term of the necessary technology , the investment required is only around 20,000 euros .
and the hackers have reliable means of turning that dirty electronic money into clean cash .
the hackers spend at least 10 hours a day at the computer . they rarely take a weekend off .
should an attack require it , they will stay awake for days at a time .
and even if they 're not working on a deal , they still have to be online and check the latest anti-virus programs to see how they can be outsmarted .
the number of cyber criminals in russia is estimated at around 20,000 .
most are between 20 and 30 years old and are graduates of the country 's technical universities .
next to no fines police in russia lack both the personnel and the technology to effectively combat the hackers .
often , the authorities are simply powerless to deal with the attacks .
only around 10 percent of the crimes are ever solved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's police has little to match the hackers with also , the fight against cyber crime still is n't being made a top priority by police in russia .
there is no countrywide databank of computer-related crimes .
journalists from abroad are generally refused interviews with the branch of the russian police responsible for dealing with cyber crime .
not only that , but if a hacker does happen to get caught , he can usually expect to escape with a mild sentence .
victor pleshchuck was involved in the bank of scotland robbery .
in september 2010 he was sentenced to six years on probation and a fine .
" if you have someone in russia who earns more than a million dollars a year , he 's practically immune against prosecution , " said ilya sachkov , head of group-ib cyber crimes investigations , the only private security company trying to hunt down the hackers .
yevgeny kaspersky said it was the mindset that still needed to change .
" judges in russia just do n't get how big these crimes are - and how much money is involved . "

the new cards boast features designed to safeguard against the hazards of the internet age , including phishing and identity theft , but critics say there are still problems . national identification cards are nothing new to germans .
citizens have been required to show their id card or a passport to the authorities since 1939 , when the nazis first wrote it into law .
after world war ii , the various occupying powers kept the policy of national id cards for everyone over the age of 16 .
on november 1 , the german government is rolling out the latest incarnation of the german national id card , the so-called electronic id , or eid .
the new cards contain a microchip using radio frequency identification technology , or rfid .
this technology is already widely used in security systems for various buildings , as well as by retailers to inventory goods .
all citizens whose id cards are expiring this year can apply for new ones , as the government begins to phase them in .
" it 's an electronic means of identifying an item , in this case an id card , " said karsten nohl , an independent security expert , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the rfid capabilities of the new cards take the concept of identification further than current ids in germany , which are also used for international travel within the european union .
the cards can be used to identify the user on the internet , and even to authenticate digital signatures .
at first glance , these new ids do n't look different than the current analog cards .
they feature a photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance , just like the old ones .
but this data is also contained within the microchip in the card , and a digital biometric photograph of the cardholder .
reduced phishing the federal office for information security , better known by its german acronym , bsi , is developing the new cards . " we have a lot of features in the card which are very , very useful , " said manuel bach , the eid project manager .
" for example , the protection against phishing sites which are a big problem in germany and around the world , and we totally get rid of it using the germany id card . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club circumvented the eid 's security on television phishing websites often are set up to look like a legitimate online merchant in order to harvest personal or financial data .
bsi claims that eid card holders could use the card via a digital reader connected to their computer in order to detect when a website does n't have a correct security certificate .
another security measure on the card is the beefed-up encryption , which is based on elliptic curve cryptography and , according to bach , is essentially unbreakable .
chink in the armor hackers tend to agree that the encryption is not the weakness in the system .
the german hacker collective , the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , raked the new system over the coals in september when they went on television and hacked the new id using basic spyware .
but it was n't the card itself that made the hack so easy .
to take advantage of the online authentication perks for the computer , the card must be coupled with a peripheral card-reading piece of hardware .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model .
their hackers installed a keylogger on the user 's computer , enabling them to steal the pin and then rewrite data on the id card using that information .
it is disingenuous of the government to promote the new system as secure while such a hole exists , according to constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman .
“ if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , ” she said .
“ the hackers will always attack the weakest point and the weakest point is the user . ”
citizens need to protect themselves better bsi 's manuel bach agreed that the end-user was the weakest link in the chain , but demurred , saying that computers infected with trojan horses and other malware are already at risk of hemorrhaging data , even without the new id card .
" the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " bach said .
" so you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . "
despite this downside , security expert karsten nohl is convinced that the authentication and remote signature functions of the id are better than the alternatives .
" this , of course , promises much more security than some wobbly line of ink on a piece of paper , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with initiatives like stork , eids like germany 's could become very common leap of faith but nohl is not convinced that the system is being handled with all due care .
" people should n't start off using this card as if there 's nothing to steal from it , " nohl warned .
" once the card is stolen or can be emulated , any future application becomes vulnerable .
the awareness of future abuse potential has to be created today . "
concerns such as nohl 's and those of the ccc are underlined by the fact that the use of this style of identification is on the rise .

the new cards boast features designed to safeguard against the hazards of the internet age , including phishing and identity theft , but critics say there are still problems . national identification cards are nothing new to germans .
citizens have been required to show their id card or a passport to the authorities since 1939 , when the nazis first wrote it into law .
after world war ii , the various occupying powers kept the policy of national id cards for everyone over the age of 16 .
on november 1 , the german government is rolling out the latest incarnation of the german national id card , the so-called electronic id , or eid .
the new cards contain a microchip using radio frequency identification technology , or rfid .
this technology is already widely used in security systems for various buildings , as well as by retailers to inventory goods .
all citizens whose id cards are expiring this year can apply for new ones , as the government begins to phase them in .
" it 's an electronic means of identifying an item , in this case an id card , " said karsten nohl , an independent security expert , in an interview with deutsche welle .
the rfid capabilities of the new cards take the concept of identification further than current ids in germany , which are also used for international travel within the european union .
the cards can be used to identify the user on the internet , and even to authenticate digital signatures .
at first glance , these new ids do n't look different than the current analog cards .
they feature a photo , name , address , date of birth , height , eye and hair color and location of issuance , just like the old ones .
but this data is also contained within the microchip in the card , and a digital biometric photograph of the cardholder .
reduced phishing the federal office for information security , better known by its german acronym , bsi , is developing the new cards . " we have a lot of features in the card which are very , very useful , " said manuel bach , the eid project manager .
" for example , the protection against phishing sites which are a big problem in germany and around the world , and we totally get rid of it using the germany id card . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos computer club circumvented the eid 's security on television phishing websites often are set up to look like a legitimate online merchant in order to harvest personal or financial data .
bsi claims that eid card holders could use the card via a digital reader connected to their computer in order to detect when a website does n't have a correct security certificate .
another security measure on the card is the beefed-up encryption , which is based on elliptic curve cryptography and , according to bach , is essentially unbreakable .
chink in the armor hackers tend to agree that the encryption is not the weakness in the system .
the german hacker collective , the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- , raked the new system over the coals in september when they went on television and hacked the new id using basic spyware .
but it was n't the card itself that made the hack so easy .
to take advantage of the online authentication perks for the computer , the card must be coupled with a peripheral card-reading piece of hardware .
card readers come in a variety of models , and the ccc circumvented the most basic model .
their hackers installed a keylogger on the user 's computer , enabling them to steal the pin and then rewrite data on the id card using that information .
it is disingenuous of the government to promote the new system as secure while such a hole exists , according to constanze kurz , a ccc spokeswoman .
“ if you pretend that all your citizens are really good with computers , and that they can manage their own it security on their systems , then you are definitely wrong , ” she said .
“ the hackers will always attack the weakest point and the weakest point is the user . ”
citizens need to protect themselves better bsi 's manuel bach agreed that the end-user was the weakest link in the chain , but demurred , saying that computers infected with trojan horses and other malware are already at risk of hemorrhaging data , even without the new id card .
" the germany id card ca n't protect you from trojan horses , it 's just a piece of plastic with a microchip inside , " bach said .
" so you as a citizen or computer user have a responsibility to secure your system .
if you do that you 're very safe , even with a basic card reader . "
despite this downside , security expert karsten nohl is convinced that the authentication and remote signature functions of the id are better than the alternatives .
" this , of course , promises much more security than some wobbly line of ink on a piece of paper , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with initiatives like stork , eids like germany 's could become very common leap of faith but nohl is not convinced that the system is being handled with all due care .
" people should n't start off using this card as if there 's nothing to steal from it , " nohl warned .
" once the card is stolen or can be emulated , any future application becomes vulnerable .
the awareness of future abuse potential has to be created today . "
concerns such as nohl 's and those of the ccc are underlined by the fact that the use of this style of identification is on the rise .
the european union is planning to launch a new initiative in 2011 called stork .
through this program , 17 participating european nations with electronic ids , including germany , would be able to cooperate across borders .
the program claims that in the future , users will be able to start a company , get a tax refund or obtain university admissions status online . author : stuart tiffen editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.10.2010 eu leaders take on lisbon amendments at two-day summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy will likely face an uphill battle at the summit as european union leaders lock horns in brussels over controversial franco-german plans to reform the lisbon treaty , german chancellor angela merkel was standing by her demands to revamp the bloc 's financial rules . leaders of the european union 's 27 member states kicked off a two-day summit in brussels on thursday , with chancellor merkel looking to push through changes to the bloc 's lisbon treaty .
news reports thursday night quoted diplomatic sources as saying the leaders had reached a " general agreement " on a " limited treaty change , " but there was no immediate elaboration or public confirmation .
the alterations proposed by germany would be aimed at preventing a repeat of the greek debt crisis , which threatened to bring down the euro single currency zone earlier this year .
" we need a mechanism that also includes banks and funds that earn high interest , so that it is not just the taxpayer who has sole responsibility , " merkel told reporters as she arrived at the summit .
widespread disagreement merkel , along with french president nicolas sarkozy , wants stiffer penalties against eu countries that breach the criteria of the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires eurozone countries to keep their budget deficits below three percent of gross domestic product .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek debt crisis led to mass protests around the country the penalties for failing to do so would involve tough sanctions or stripping countries that break euro rules of their voting rights in the eu council of ministers .
merkel originally had been pushing for even stricter sanctions against offenders of the pact , but was forced to compromise in order to reach agreement on the matter with france .
still , several smaller eu states may push for even softer sanctions .
also under discussion at the summit will be whether a temporary , three-year fund of emergency loans for eu states that fail to keep their books in order should be turned into a permanent crisis mechanism .
berlin paid the lion 's share into a fund to help bailout debt-laden greece earlier this year , but the measure was highly unpopular in germany .
furthermore , merkel 's government said it would not be able to contribute to any such fund under the current rules of the lisbon treaty without risking action from the the country 's constitutional court .
' pandora 's box ' germany and france have found themselves increasingly isolated on the issue , as opposition grows to freezing voting rights , in particular , among potential violators , but also among countries worried about the negative impact of the eu 's incessant bickering . many member countries have expressed fears of a repeat of the recently enacted lisbon treaty 's difficult birth , which took eight years after failed referendum campaigns in france , ireland and the netherlands .
eu justice commissioner viviane reding maintained recently that trying to force treaty change would only reopen a " pandora 's box " after a " decade " of navel-gazing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herman van rompuy may be forced to pick up the pieces a collection of smaller eu states have also raised their reluctance to be bullied into any treaty amendments by france and germany , which , as the largest countries , have a reputation for dominating eu affairs .
the ever-present hesitancy of many smaller members to give up powers to brussels is also a factor in their opposition to the german-french plan .
british prime minister david cameron has also come out saying he would not support any major rewriting of the lisbon treaty .
puzzling behavior the socialist leader in the european parliament , martin schulz , said the plans by germany and france , europe 's two largest countries , would be an affront to european council president herman van rompuy , who has been called on to chair a special task force looking into eu economic governance .
" i ask myself if mr van rompuy can see the consequences here , " schulz said .
" he gets an order to detail important reforms , but before he can present anything france and germany say , ' no , we have already decided everything . " '
former belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who now leads the liberal group in the european parliament , labeled germany 's backtrack on its original strict-sanctions goal as puzzling .
" i find this utterly incomprehensible , particularly from germany , " he said .
" for 10 months they have demanded stricter punishment , and then they move in the opposite direction . "
the summit opens thursday afternoon and is set to conclude friday .

recently , taiwan and china signed their largest free trade agreement ever and now there is talk of a " free travel " agreement . citizens from mainland china have been allowed to travel to taiwan since 2008 , but only on designated group tours and after tedious application and selection procedures .
negotiations about " ziyouxing " or " free travel " are now underway – this would allow tourists to come to taiwan on their own . wu zhengde from taiwan 's providence university says this could be possible as early as next year , but that it will start off as a trial run .
" in this concept there is also the question of numbers .
how many people are there and what are the capacities ?
and that is exactly the problem china is dealing with now .
we just have to work on the details and see if the existing structure will suffice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists love to visit taipei 101 , one of the world 's tallest skyscrapers wu believes both economies would benefit greatly from free travel , especially because an increasing number of people from the people ’ s republic want to travel to taiwan . tourism to taiwan is increasing by the day last year , the average number of mainland chinese traveling to taiwan each day was a little over 1,100 .
in the first half of 2010 alone , that number went up to 3,400 . with around 1.2 million visitors this year already , tourists from the chinese mainland constitute the largest chunk of taiwan 's tourism .
numbers will only grow when tourists are not restricted to group travel . but some , such as ru hongjin , believe this is a dangerous development .
he is currently running a survey for taiwan 's tourism bureau and thinks this is a further device china could use to bully taiwan at will . " it will damage the economy .
we ca n't treat china like any other country because other countries do n't have such a complex relationship with taiwan .
they will try to use the economy for their political purposes , " he says . ru is also worried that china is mainly concerned with making a good impression on taiwan but alice chen , a deputy director at the tourism bureau , does not see it that way . tourism can enhance communication she feels the main goal of tourism is to enhance communication and sees china 's interest in taiwan as genuine .
she says that tourists from the mainland like to watch taiwanese television shows , which are so different from their own , and get to know taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of taiwan 's national palace museum " we were separated for so many years , for decades , so they like to come and see everything , especially taipei 101 or the palace museum .
they have an itinerary of seven or eight days .
this means they go all over the island and try to see everything . " one of the taiwanese government 's largest fears is that too many people will come in illegally , which feeds into another stereotype : that the tour guides ' number one task is making sure the visitors do not run away . " actually they do bear some responsibility and we have to make sure they come to taiwan for purposes of tourism and not for other purposes .
if a chinese tourist goes missing , we will charge the travel agency 100,000 new taiwan dollars , " says alice chen . but surprisingly , the rate of runaway chinese tourists is low in taiwan .
on average just three out of 100,000 " go missing " on a tour .
for the taiwanese tourist industry , it is certainly a risk worth taking . author : sarah berning editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 28.10.2010 russian hackers rake in millions with little fear of the law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hackers are usually one step ahead of the police cyber crime in russia is booming .
the number of attacks directed against europe , the us and russia itself is on the rise .
but so far the police are no match for the hackers . russia is considered a haven for cyber crime .
the country 's hackers are among the most professional in the world .
their tools are computers and the internet , which they skillfully use to spy , manipulate and rob bank accounts , attack websites or send spam e-mails .
the hackers are especially versatile when it comes to stealing data .
hundreds of attacks are registered daily from russia .
more than half of those are directed against the european union , canada and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : need 1,000 credit card details ?
for $ 400 they 're yours " they are a threat in particular to bank customers with more than 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- on their accounts and who use online banking , " said nikita kislizin , russian it specialist and editor-in-chief of the magazine " hacker . "
he said the target of such attacks were average internet users as well as financial institutions , corporations , media organizations and even security services .
russian hackers stole 100,000 euros from the accounts of us bank citibank in 1994 .
swedish bank nordea was targetted and lost around one million euros in 2007 .
the royal bank of scotland lost as much as seven million euros to hackers in 2008 .
and hackers are also busy attacking sites inside russia .
most of their capers are n't reported to the police or in the media , as most victims want to avoid public attention .
organized crime because high-speed internet connections are needed to carry out such activities , most of the country 's cyber criminals are said to live either in moscow or st. petersburg .
experts believe they are part of a highly organized back market .
the hackers meet with their clients in internet forums where services and prices can be discussed anonymously .
access to such a forum costs around $ 1,000 and requires a recommendation from at least three registered members .
the prices for various ' services ' are fixed .
bringing down a website costs around $ 300 per day .
for $ 400 a customer can obtain detailed data from 1,000 credit cards .
sending out a million spam e-mails costs about $ 200 .
should a job require a special skill set , the criminals often team up .
the annual turnover associated with illegal activities is estimated at around one billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through the internet hackers can access almost any computer in the world " they 're driving very big cars , " said yevgeny kaspersky , head of the internet security company kaspersky lab .
" money is their only goal , " he added .
it 's said that a gang of 10 hackers can earn around 10 million euros a year . in term of the necessary technology , the investment required is only around 20,000 euros .
and the hackers have reliable means of turning that dirty electronic money into clean cash .
the hackers spend at least 10 hours a day at the computer . they rarely take a weekend off .
should an attack require it , they will stay awake for days at a time .
and even if they 're not working on a deal , they still have to be online and check the latest anti-virus programs to see how they can be outsmarted .
the number of cyber criminals in russia is estimated at around 20,000 .
most are between 20 and 30 years old and are graduates of the country 's technical universities .
next to no fines police in russia lack both the personnel and the technology to effectively combat the hackers .
often , the authorities are simply powerless to deal with the attacks .
only around 10 percent of the crimes are ever solved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's police has little to match the hackers with also , the fight against cyber crime still is n't being made a top priority by police in russia .
there is no countrywide databank of computer-related crimes .
journalists from abroad are generally refused interviews with the branch of the russian police responsible for dealing with cyber crime .
not only that , but if a hacker does happen to get caught , he can usually expect to escape with a mild sentence .
victor pleshchuck was involved in the bank of scotland robbery .
in september 2010 he was sentenced to six years on probation and a fine .
" if you have someone in russia who earns more than a million dollars a year , he 's practically immune against prosecution , " said ilya sachkov , head of group-ib cyber crimes investigations , the only private security company trying to hunt down the hackers .
yevgeny kaspersky said it was the mindset that still needed to change .
" judges in russia just do n't get how big these crimes are - and how much money is involved . "

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .

" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .

lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .

the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .

rhineland-palatinate is home to frankfurt-hahn airport – a major regional hub for budget airlines .
one of them , ryanair , has already announced the levy would force it to cancel services and downsize its local fleet of aircraft next year .
rhineland-palatinate economics minister hendrik hering told the handelsblatt business daily he was determined to sue because the levy would " clearly harm the regional economy " .
hering said independent evaluations commissioned by the state government showed that while the levy would generate one billion euros in revenue , its knock-on effects would ultimately burn a 500-million-euro hole in the public purse .
ryanair reductions ryanair announced on wednesday that it would cancel nine routes from frankfurt-hahn airport beginning next summer as a direct result of the tax .
the number of flights flying from hahn will fall roughly 30 percent from 532 per week to 382 , the irish low-cost carrier said on wednesday .
the cancellation of services to cities including seville , danzig , prague and gothenburg would see the airline reduce its frankfurt-hahn-based fleet from 11 aircraft to eight .
" as a business , we have to look at those flights which are profitable for us , " henrike schmidt , a spokeswoman for ryanair , told deutsche welle .
" we have cut routes that we think are traveled mostly by passengers who will not want to pay this new surcharge . "
ryanair said it had a million passengers who are not willing to pay eight euros more per ticket - the amount to be levied on short-haul flights .
the new air passenger tax , which goes into effect on january 1 , will impose a charge of 45 euros on long-haul passengers and 25 euros on medium-haul flights .
filling government coffers the controversial tax , or " ecological air travel levy , " was included in a package of public spending cuts introduced by chancellor angela merkel earlier this year .
the government has said it needs to slash spending by 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- by 2014 to stabilize the country 's economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt-hahn airport is a major regional hub for budget airlines but the tax has been slammed by airlines and industry groups , who say it will cost jobs , hurt the tourist industry and encourage international passengers to bypass germany completely .
in 2009 , there were 182 million air passengers in germany .
" we think it could cost the country 16,000 jobs and germany could lose up to five million passengers , " carola scheffler of the german airline group bdf told deutsche welle .
" it also will result in more auto traffic , so we do n't think it has much to do with environmental protection , even though it has been couched in those terms , " she added .
industry-wide criticism other airlines have slammed the tax plan .
lufthansa has said its " global connections " will take a hit because passengers will look to avoid transferring at german hubs to bypass the fee .
air berlin ceo joachim hunold told reuters that " if a four-member family has to pay 120 euros more for a holiday in egypt , then the little man is being burdened again . "
" most german airlines have spoken out against this tax , " said ryanair 's schmidt .
" it 's going to result in further reductions in routes , especially domestic german routes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the tax will scare some 5 million air passengers away from germany berlin has dismissed the criticism , saying it is overblown .
this summer , michael offer , a spokesman for germany 's finance ministry , rejected the numbers cited about job losses , saying : " we do not understand where these figures come from and they do not correspond to what we foresee . "
airlines " should not suffer large losses " from the tax , which is expected to be passed on to passengers , offer added .
a similar airline passenger tax exists in ireland , belgium and the uk .
the netherlands and denmark both tried similar taxes but dropped them after seeing travelers bypass their airports in favor of lower-cost alternatives in neighboring countries .
hartmut fricke , director the institute of logistics and aviation at the technical university of dresden , agreed with ryanair that the profit margins for tickets on short-haul flights are extremely narrow , but he told deutsche welle he doubted that an 8 euro surcharge would lead to a drastic fall in passenger volumes .
he said one aspect of the tax is to encourage people to take the train or less-polluting forms of transportation instead of hopping on a plane .
" but whether it will really contribute to the environmental goals of this government , well , i 'm pretty skeptical , " he said .

that he made so little fuss about it sums up a striker who has quietly gone about his business . as befitting a man who shies away from the kind of spotlights that follow soccer stars in this day and age , pizarro celebrated the fact that he had become the highest-scoring foreign player in the bundesliga 's history last weekend in low-key fashion .
the peruvian international didn ’ t throw a party or release 134 white doves over the weserstadion , he commemorated the record by sitting down with his kids on the couch to watch a dvd of every one of his record-breaking 134 goals .
" they cheered for each goal all over again , " the 32-year-old striker told reporters after he went back to work .
and so they should .
their dad had just eclipsed one of the bundesliga 's towering attacking icons , giovane elber - the brazilian forward who made his name during his nine-year stint at stuttgart and bayern munich .
pizarro 's 75th minute strike during werder bremen 's 4-1 win over borussia moenchengladbach last saturday echoed across the continents with fans in his home country waiting on the moment that the former bayern and chelsea striker wrote his name in the history books .
" even my friends in peru had been waiting for this moment , " pizarro admitted .
" they are proud and happy that i overtook giovane elber , as am i. "
two spells in germany , one impressive record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six years at bayern brought pizarro goals and silverware the peruvian 's return to bremen after a less-than-auspicious spell in london has seen the striker recapture the form which persuaded werder to bring him to germany in 1999 from alianza lima .
he scored 29 goals in the two seasons which made up his first spell at the northern german club before heading south for sixth seasons where he netted 71 goals for bayern munich , winning three bundesliga titles , three german cups and a league cup in the process .
free to leave after his contract expired at bayern , pizarro joined chelsea in the summer of 2007 , scoring on his premier league debut .
all signs pointed to a successful premiership career .
but when the man who signed him for the english champions , jose mourinho , left the club , pizarro fell out of favor .
he was never going to dislodge chelsea legend didier drogba in the stamford bridge pecking order , and as the season wore on avram grant preferred his own signing , nicolas anelka .
after just one season in london the peruvian was loaned back to werder bremen for the 2008 season with just two chelsea goals to his name - the other coming in an fa cup match against birmingham city .
in the bremen fold , peruvian finds the scoring groove again back in germany with werder , pizarro was welcomed as a returning hero and he contributed 17 goals to the club 's 2008/09 campaign , helping them to reach the europa league final where they were beaten 2-1 by shahktar donetsk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen expect the andean bomber to keep on scoring pizarro 's official transfer back to bremen was agreed the following season and he scored a further 16 goals for the club , adding another dfb cup winners medal to his collection as werder beat bayer leverkusen 1-0 in the final .
his record-breaking goal last weekend was only his first strike of a season which has seen him slowly return to fitness after a long-term injury , but he followed that up with a goal in bremen 's dfb cup second round defeat to bayern munich in mid-week .
despite having had a tough time with injuries since the end of last season , pizarro is still regarded as an integral part of the werder bremen squad and - as his record proves - can be relied upon to get goals when charged with the responsibility .
something his coach appreciates highly .
" he 's an outstanding player with fantastic skills .
it was only a matter of time before he scored again , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf after pizarro 's historic strike saw him pass the 133 mark he set back in may .
" i hope he plays for a long time here .
he 'll score many more goals .
that 's his job . "
one has he has done with minimum fuss and maximum impact .

but the fact that you and three other historians were commissioned in 2005 by the then german foreign minister , joschka fischer , to come up with a comprehensive report on this topic seems to indicate that this is not true .
now that your book is out , the question remains , though , why such a detailed look at german diplomats ' involvement in nazi crimes comes so late .
peter hayes : as you indicated , the immediate occasion was joschka fischer 's discovery that the foreign ministry 's internal organizations continued to publish laudatory obituaries of individuals who had dubious pasts , and he wanted to put a stop to that .

now that your research is finished , what revelations would you single out as having been completely new to you ?
there were a number of things that were new to me .
i was not aware of how consciously some people in the late 1940s set about building an alibi legend for the foreign office .
the broad picture of the nazi-era events that have attracted the most attention in the press , however , was already known to specialists , particularly the involvement of the foreign office in the holocaust , and especially in dealing with allied states with whom nazi germany had to negotiate in order to obtain the jews to deport .
the involvement of german diplomats in that process was not so well known , especially not to the general public .

other scholars believe that 's an exaggeration .
what 's your take on it ?
i would n't have put it exactly as professor conze did .
i would have said that the foreign office was a part of a criminal regime rather than directly calling the office a criminal organization .
but if you think it over carefully , it looks like a distinction without a difference .
if the organization in question is part of a criminal operation , if it is an active part promoting the agenda of that operation , then , you know , in the end it 's a criminal organization .
in the past , researchers were quoted as having had enormous difficulties in trying to actually get hold of documents highlighting german diplomats ' activities under the nazis .
how hard - or how easy - was it for you to obtain the material that you needed for the book ?
one of the oddest features of the foreign office in germany is that it has its own archives , and they are kept separate from the federal archives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 28.10.2010 danish proposal could give tax authorities ability to copy corporate hard drives at any time großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anders hoeg nissen is the host of harddisken in a dw interview , a danish tech journalist explains that the proposal has gone through a hearing , and now the tax authority is drafting a response .
computer security experts and privacy advocates are very concerned . last month , the danish ministry of taxation proposed a new bill that would allow them to copy any corporate hard drive , without warning , for the purpose of verifying that the company was paying appropriate taxes .
some conservative politicians have supported the bill in recent weeks , and while the move has n't gotten much attention outside of denmark , it could set a precedent for corporate privacy and security .
to learn more , deutsche welle spoke with anders hoeg nissen , the host of the danish broadcasting corporation 's radio program , harddisken .
deutsche welle : this plan , this proposal is to have the tax authorities keep mirror copies of corporate hard disks .
is that right ?
well , the suggestion is that they are not going to be able to keep real-time , updated , mirrors of company servers , but the idea is that they will be able to make copies of all the content of company servers whenever they want to , to be able to perform some type of control to check that the danish companies are paying their taxes and so on .
that 's how it 's worked until now , with a warrant , they could come with a couple of big hard drives in a bag and start copying .
the new law proposal suggests that they would be able to do this without a warrant at any time .
now i imagine that this would raise a lot of questions in the corporate , privacy and computer security communities , no ?
it has raised a lot of questions .
from the tech community it 's very much a data privacy discussion .
it goes against what we believe , that we are alowed to have our own data and not have the authorities be able to snoop into them at their discretion .
but the industry , the representatives of the danish companies , for example , the confederation of the danish industries ' ict department has called this worthy of a banana republic .
there 's been some very strong reactions and strong language at this presentation of this proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could takes months for this proposal to pass the danish parliament now , i understand that the tax authorities want to be able to control that people are paying their taxes .
but at the same time , allowing a government entity to have access to secure , private information , clients and other kinds of things , it just seems like you 're asking for trouble .
i would think so , yes .
what some of the companies that have reacted to this are saying is that : we have a lot of confidential information , business secrets , contacts and lots of stuff that has nothing to do with whether or not we 're paying our taxes or not , and it makes no sense that the tax authorities should gain access to all this information without some kind of warrant or some kind of suspicion that the company is not paying the taxes that they 're supposed to .
this is obviously a huge breach of the company 's private information .
who is supporting this ?
is this just an idea that has come from the tax authority itself ?
has this been supported by any political parties ?
as far as i can make out , this came from the tax authorities , but with the minister for taxes here in denmark is sanctioning this proposal that initially came from the tax authorities .
it seems that both the liberal party and the conservative party that make up the government in denmark at the moment are supporting this not as a proposal , but some of the thoughts in the proposal .
it 's not at the stage where it 's ready to be made into a law .
it 's just gone into a hearing , and they 're looking at the answers .
so what would it take for this to actually become law in denmark , and do you think it actually has a chance that it could become law ?
i just spoke to the tax authorities press office and they said that they 've received the answers from the hearing process and they 're going over those answers and trying to see if the original proposal should be somehow modified or perhaps completely taken off the table .
they would n't divulge what kind of answers they 've gotten , but we can only speculate after having read the reception in the press .
but i would guess that this will not come to an actual law , in the form that we 've seen it so far .

the discrepancy is indicative of how divisive the issue is .
in the parliamentary debate prior to the vote on extending the lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants , the government of chancellor angela merkel and the opposition engaged in a no-holds-barred exchange of accusations and counter-accusations .
the chairman of the opposition social democrats , sigmar gabriel , blasted the center-right coalition government of merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats for not having a real energy concept for the future and unnecessarily “ dividing society where it was already united . ”
he said the plans to extend the lifetimes of germany 's 17 existing reactors by an average of 12 years only benefitted a few large companies and would cut into investment in renewable energies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear policy is ' divisive , ' said the spd party leader “ instead of helping to add another 300,000 jobs in this sector to the 300,000 already there , and instead of ensuring that climate protection and economic progress can really work together , you are going to stop progress , ” gabriel said .
the green party 's parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused the coalition of “ pork barrel politics ” and “ of watering down safety standards . ”
“ the government promised an energy revolution , but this is a coup d 'etat , ” he said .
government defends energy plan environment minister norbert roettgen , called the criticism a bunch of “ battle cries without arguments ” and labeled opposition demands an “ energy policy dud ” with “ nothing to offer . ”
roettgen defended the government 's plan , arguing that it would actually increase the amount of renewable energy used across germany from the current level of about 20 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters do n't want partisan bickering , said the minister “ our aim is to generate 80 percent of german electricity from renewable sources by 2050 .
we want to lower carbon emissions by at least 80 percent and plan to raise energy efficiency by 50 percent .
this is the future we are working on , ” the minister said .
“ voters want future-oriented policies and not partisan bickering , ” roettgen shouted at the opposition .
law faces uncertain future while the politicians were debating the issue inside , outside on thursday , around 2,000 protesters formed a human chain around the bundestag .
nearby , greenpeace activists mounted a giant anti-nuclear poster on the glass facade of merkel 's christian democrat party headquarters .
the legislation , as passed , now means that germany will have nuclear power as part of its energy mix beyond 2021 , the date merkel 's predecessor gerhard schroeder had pledged to turn them off for good .
the law could still face a tough fight in the bundesrat , or upper house of parliament , where merkel 's coalition lost its majority in may - as well as court challenges promised by the opposition .

" the agreement with thailand 's prime minister abhisit was that central bankers and finance ministers talk a little bit more frequently because right now the action have been taken on an individual rather than a coordinated basis , " a spokesman for the philippine president aquino said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the asean summit in hanoi will last three days the exchange rate issue comes at a time when southeast asian economies are worried about the possibilities of getting sandwiched by a currency war between china and the united states . capital inflows are pushing asian currencies higher still and have led to steep gains in stocks and property prices , fuelling fears of inflation and speculative bubbles . pressure on myanmar to release aung san su kyi the leaders also worked on ambitious plans for political and economic union by 2015 .
however , analysts say that transforming the bloc of 580 million people into a political , economic and security community is easier said than done . moreover , political divisions over myanmar and its poor human rights record continue to exist .
the philippines has described the myanmar election that is due on nov .

but the elections have been postponed so many times in the past , that nobody is holding their breath . ivory coast or côte d 'ivoire is essentially a country of two halves .
the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .
yet he says those who come are not search of political guidance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian president laurent gbagbo " we all support president gbagbo 's program , " he said .
“ and we are willing to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , defend his life and our civil society one way or another . "
soukrou 's views are echoed by customers in a public bar not far from the sorbonne .
they say they want president laurent gbagbo to continue in office and want to see an end to the french influence in their country .
not everybody 's darling but the president , who has been in office since 2000 is not everybody 's favorite .
one man in abidjan told deutsche welle that gbagbo is holding the country back .
" in terms of politics he does whatever he can to stay in power , " the man said .
" we have been supposed to have elections for the past five years , but it 's never happened because the president blocks everything . "
the current head of state will be up against 13 other candidates , the most important of which are henri konan bedié and alassane dramane ouattara .
the three of them have been fighting one another for power since the 1990s , and are considered the old boys of ivory coast politics .
their parties are well-organized and between them they own several newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian press newspapers they use for aggressive tactics in campaigns which often concentrate more on making accusations about their respective opponents than on any real political program .
and consequently some doubt the ballot will even happen .
one such is jean louis billon , head of the country 's chamber of trade and industry .
" if you add it all up , we have had more peace agreements here than were necessary to end world war ii , " billon told deutsche welle .
" i truly doubt that there is enough political will to end this crisis , because if we really wanted to have elections , we 'd have had them long ago ! "
simple wishes what he and most of the population of the nation would like to see is the voting in of a president that can lead them back to the position of economic strength they enjoyed before the 2002 coup .
at the top of the general wish list are education and employment . " the first victims of the crisis are business owners , the population and our young people , " billon said .
" we have eight million unemployed young people , that means eight million young people without a perspective and with nothing to do . "
bildunterschrift : a street in abidjan he describes it as an explosive situation .
and he is not the only one to feel it .
" if things go on like this , there will be an uprising .
prices are so high , we can hardly afford to keep ourselves , " mother of two , yeli , told deutsche welle .
" we 've had enough , we 're sick of it . "
like many others , she is furious with politicians for failing to tap into the country 's resources and allow it to be the flourishing west african nation of old .
new generation some observers , however , believe the resources are part of the current political status quo .
rebels in the north have secured access to diamonds , gold , ore and politicians across the spectrum benefit from the sale of cocoa .
against that backdrop , patrick n 'gouan , head of a collective of civil society groups , does n't hold out much hope for any grand post-electoral change in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillaume soro , prime minister of ivory coast " if the country is run like it is now after the elections , the crisis wo n't go away , " he told deutsche welle .
" it will just mean that the government and opposition share the riches while the rest of the population gets poorer . "
precisely that is what the people of the côte d 'ivoire , half of whom are under the age of 30 , do not want to see happen .
twenty-five year-old amadou traoré told deutsche welle that his country needs a new generation of politicians , leaders who look to the future rather than back into the past .
and if they are not forthcoming , he warned , there could well be more trouble on the horizon .
" i am certain that one day the young people will defend themselves against this elite , " he said .
" we have seen the events in niger , and i could imagine the same kind of development here . "

but the elections have been postponed so many times in the past , that nobody is holding their breath . ivory coast or côte d 'ivoire is essentially a country of two halves .
the north is controlled by rebels under guillame soro and the south by the official government under president , laurent gbagbo .
the two men signed a ceasefire in 2007 , soro became prime minister , elections were called for the following year but cancelled before they happened .
they have been cancelled again since and are now finally scheduled for this sunday .
against that backdrop , the ballot is very much the talking point of the moment on both sides of what is still a north-south divide .
one place where that talking is particularly loud is in the southern city and political and economic center , abidjan .
there , on a busy market square is an open space known as the sorbonne , where for three hours every day anyone who wants to deliver a speech in public , can .
many do and many more come along to listen .
president of the sorbonne jeremy soukrou told deutsche welle how important the platform is as a means of getting information to the country 's residents and that politics is particularly high on the agenda at the moment .
yet he says those who come are not search of political guidance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian president laurent gbagbo " we all support president gbagbo 's program , " he said .
“ and we are willing to support him , to protect the institutions of our country , defend his life and our civil society one way or another . "
soukrou 's views are echoed by customers in a public bar not far from the sorbonne .
they say they want president laurent gbagbo to continue in office and want to see an end to the french influence in their country .
not everybody 's darling but the president , who has been in office since 2000 is not everybody 's favorite .
one man in abidjan told deutsche welle that gbagbo is holding the country back .
" in terms of politics he does whatever he can to stay in power , " the man said .
" we have been supposed to have elections for the past five years , but it 's never happened because the president blocks everything . "
the current head of state will be up against 13 other candidates , the most important of which are henri konan bedié and alassane dramane ouattara .
the three of them have been fighting one another for power since the 1990s , and are considered the old boys of ivory coast politics .
their parties are well-organized and between them they own several newspapers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivorian press newspapers they use for aggressive tactics in campaigns which often concentrate more on making accusations about their respective opponents than on any real political program .
and consequently some doubt the ballot will even happen .
one such is jean louis billon , head of the country 's chamber of trade and industry .
" if you add it all up , we have had more peace agreements here than were necessary to end world war ii , " billon told deutsche welle .
" i truly doubt that there is enough political will to end this crisis , because if we really wanted to have elections , we 'd have had them long ago ! "
simple wishes what he and most of the population of the nation would like to see is the voting in of a president that can lead them back to the position of economic strength they enjoyed before the 2002 coup .
at the top of the general wish list are education and employment . " the first victims of the crisis are business owners , the population and our young people , " billon said .
" we have eight million unemployed young people , that means eight million young people without a perspective and with nothing to do . "
bildunterschrift : a street in abidjan he describes it as an explosive situation .
and he is not the only one to feel it .
" if things go on like this , there will be an uprising .
prices are so high , we can hardly afford to keep ourselves , " mother of two , yeli , told deutsche welle .
" we 've had enough , we 're sick of it . "
like many others , she is furious with politicians for failing to tap into the country 's resources and allow it to be the flourishing west african nation of old .
new generation some observers , however , believe the resources are part of the current political status quo .
rebels in the north have secured access to diamonds , gold , ore and politicians across the spectrum benefit from the sale of cocoa .
against that backdrop , patrick n 'gouan , head of a collective of civil society groups , does n't hold out much hope for any grand post-electoral change in ivory coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillaume soro , prime minister of ivory coast " if the country is run like it is now after the elections , the crisis wo n't go away , " he told deutsche welle .
" it will just mean that the government and opposition share the riches while the rest of the population gets poorer . "
precisely that is what the people of the côte d 'ivoire , half of whom are under the age of 30 , do not want to see happen .
twenty-five year-old amadou traoré told deutsche welle that his country needs a new generation of politicians , leaders who look to the future rather than back into the past .
and if they are not forthcoming , he warned , there could well be more trouble on the horizon .
" i am certain that one day the young people will defend themselves against this elite , " he said .
" we have seen the events in niger , and i could imagine the same kind of development here . "
