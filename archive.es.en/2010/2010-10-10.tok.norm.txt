" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2010 germany 's first university course for imams opens in osnabrueck großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most imams in germany have been trained abroad osnabrueck university is paving the way for a growth in islamic studies with the aim of better integrating muslims into german society .
on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2010 germany 's first university course for imams opens in osnabrueck großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most imams in germany have been trained abroad osnabrueck university is paving the way for a growth in islamic studies with the aim of better integrating muslims into german society .
on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 10.10.2010 israeli writer david grossman wins german book trade peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grossman 's debut novel follows an israeli soldier and a palestinian storyteller his work often deals with the relationship between israel and palestine - an issue that became especially tragic for the author in 2006 .
david grossman is the winner of this year 's peace prize of the german book trade . on sunday , as part of the frankfurt book fair , david grossman is to receive this year 's peace prize of the german book trade , an annual award honoring figures whose work advances the cause of peace .
" the committee honors the israeli writer david grossman , who has actively shown his commitment to the cause of reconciliation between the israelis and the palestinians , " the judge 's association said .
" in his novels , essays and short stories he seeks to understand and to describe the attitude of the unlike-minded and not just his own view .
david grossmann gives a literary voice to the difficult task of living together , a voice that is heard around the world . "
grossman makes the impression of being shy and writes constantly , no matter where he is .
" writing a novel is the most complete experience that i know , and it takes three or four years .
it allows me to explore any possible place - whether in myself or even within other people that would otherwise be inaccessible to me , " he said .
although his books explore a variety of perspectives and have clear social dimensions , grossman said the audience plays no role in his writing process .
" when i write novels , i write them as though no one would read them .
that 's a very , very intimate act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grossman 's most recent publication in english is called " to the end of the land " a broad spectrum the peace prize of the german book trade is awarded to individuals active across a range of fictional , artistic or academic genres and is endowed with a 25,000 euro -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- prize .
winners within the last decade include philosopher juergen habermas , nigerian author chinua achebe and the german painter and sculptor anselm kiefer .
david grossman 's own career has ranged across several fields .
the son of a bus driver , he studied philosophy and theater before beginning a career in radio in israel .
for 14 years , he worked on a popular children 's radio program and published children 's books .
grossman first published a novel titled " the smile of the lamb " in 1983 that took up what later became the central theme of his engagement as an author and public figure : the relationship between israelis and palestinians .
from fiction to personal tragedy in may 2003 , grossman began a novel with a storyline that would eventually become the basis of tragedy within the author 's own family .
the book dealt with fears shared by many israeli parents about the lives of their sons .
grossman 's son jonathan had just finished his military service in 2003 , while his youngest son uri was preparing to begin service half of a year later .
the novel was still unfinished in 2006 , when uri was killed by hezbollah forces just before the end of the second lebanon war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellow israeli author amos oz won the german book trade peace prize in 1992 after his son 's death , grossman did n't know if he could bring himself to finish the book .
he shared that with his friend , colleague and fellow peace prize-winner amos oz , who told him , " the book will save you , david . "
in november 2006 , grossman stood before tens of thousands of demonstrators in tel aviv and gave expression to a dominant sentiment in the country : " one of the worst things the war did was to make it seem even more as though there is no king in israel these days and that our leadership is hollow , " he said .
" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
due to the holocaust , it was difficult for me to hear the language and travel there , " the writer said .
" when i began writing in israel , i said to myself , i can come to germany once a book has been published there under my name .
in my eyes , one of the most terrible things that happened during the holocaust is that the people were murdered anonymously and had no names . "

david grossman is the winner of this year 's peace prize of the german book trade . on sunday , as part of the frankfurt book fair , david grossman is to receive this year 's peace prize of the german book trade , an annual award honoring figures whose work advances the cause of peace .
" the committee honors the israeli writer david grossman , who has actively shown his commitment to the cause of reconciliation between the israelis and the palestinians , " the judge 's association said .
" in his novels , essays and short stories he seeks to understand and to describe the attitude of the unlike-minded and not just his own view .
david grossmann gives a literary voice to the difficult task of living together , a voice that is heard around the world . "
grossman makes the impression of being shy and writes constantly , no matter where he is .
" writing a novel is the most complete experience that i know , and it takes three or four years .
it allows me to explore any possible place - whether in myself or even within other people that would otherwise be inaccessible to me , " he said .
although his books explore a variety of perspectives and have clear social dimensions , grossman said the audience plays no role in his writing process .
" when i write novels , i write them as though no one would read them .

david grossman 's own career has ranged across several fields .
the son of a bus driver , he studied philosophy and theater before beginning a career in radio in israel .
for 14 years , he worked on a popular children 's radio program and published children 's books .
grossman first published a novel titled " the smile of the lamb " in 1983 that took up what later became the central theme of his engagement as an author and public figure : the relationship between israelis and palestinians .
from fiction to personal tragedy in may 2003 , grossman began a novel with a storyline that would eventually become the basis of tragedy within the author 's own family .
the book dealt with fears shared by many israeli parents about the lives of their sons .
grossman 's son jonathan had just finished his military service in 2003 , while his youngest son uri was preparing to begin service half of a year later .
the novel was still unfinished in 2006 , when uri was killed by hezbollah forces just before the end of the second lebanon war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellow israeli author amos oz won the german book trade peace prize in 1992 after his son 's death , grossman did n't know if he could bring himself to finish the book .
he shared that with his friend , colleague and fellow peace prize-winner amos oz , who told him , " the book will save you , david . "
in november 2006 , grossman stood before tens of thousands of demonstrators in tel aviv and gave expression to a dominant sentiment in the country : " one of the worst things the war did was to make it seem even more as though there is no king in israel these days and that our leadership is hollow , " he said .
" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
due to the holocaust , it was difficult for me to hear the language and travel there , " the writer said .
" when i began writing in israel , i said to myself , i can come to germany once a book has been published there under my name .
in my eyes , one of the most terrible things that happened during the holocaust is that the people were murdered anonymously and had no names . "

" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials say the northern wall of an alumina plant reservoir could fail within days . workers in western hungary raced to build an emergency dam on sunday as cracks in a reservoir widened , threatening to unleash a second flood of toxic waste on the village of kolontar and nearby rivers .
officials have said it 's not a matter of if but when the northern wall will collapse .
environment state secretary zoltan illes said the crack , now 25 meters -lrb- 82 feet -rrb- in length , had widened slightly by sunday and that the damaged reservoir now looked to be beyond repair , according to hungarian news agency mti .
illes said the wall could collapse " within one day or a week . "
about 1,000 people were evacuated from kolontar on saturday , and emergency workers are rushing to complete a new dam to protect the town and the nearby community of devecser , home to 5,400 people .
on monday , about one million cubic meters of toxic red sludge leaked from an alumina plant reservoir , killing seven people , injuring 123 and polluting rivers including a local branch of the danube .
the highly alkaline sludge , a byproduct of alumina production , has a caustic effect on the skin .
it contains heavy metals , such as lead , and is slightly radioactive .
' race against time ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental critics have said the dam was weak for months before the disaster gyorgyi tottos , a spokeswoman for disaster crews , said authorities hoped to complete the 600-meter dam within days .
" this is a race against time as good weather is forecast for the coming few days but then the rain will come .
if we can have the dam finished by the time the rain comes , then it will be all right , " she said .
monday 's spill covered 1,017 hectares -lrb- 2,513 acres -rrb- , but tottos said the remaining sludge was thicker and could only spread over an area of about 500 to 1,000 meters from its origin .
prime minister viktor orban has described the spill as the worst ecological catastrophe in hungary 's history .
he said he will inform parliament on monday about the findings of an investigation and promised the " toughest possible consequences " to ensure such a disaster is not repeated .

" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 10.10.2010 israeli writer david grossman wins german book trade peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grossman 's debut novel follows an israeli soldier and a palestinian storyteller his work often deals with the relationship between israel and palestine - an issue that became especially tragic for the author in 2006 .
david grossman is the winner of this year 's peace prize of the german book trade . on sunday , as part of the frankfurt book fair , david grossman is to receive this year 's peace prize of the german book trade , an annual award honoring figures whose work advances the cause of peace .
" the committee honors the israeli writer david grossman , who has actively shown his commitment to the cause of reconciliation between the israelis and the palestinians , " the judge 's association said .
" in his novels , essays and short stories he seeks to understand and to describe the attitude of the unlike-minded and not just his own view .
david grossmann gives a literary voice to the difficult task of living together , a voice that is heard around the world . "
grossman makes the impression of being shy and writes constantly , no matter where he is .
" writing a novel is the most complete experience that i know , and it takes three or four years .
it allows me to explore any possible place - whether in myself or even within other people that would otherwise be inaccessible to me , " he said .
although his books explore a variety of perspectives and have clear social dimensions , grossman said the audience plays no role in his writing process .
" when i write novels , i write them as though no one would read them .
that 's a very , very intimate act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grossman 's most recent publication in english is called " to the end of the land " a broad spectrum the peace prize of the german book trade is awarded to individuals active across a range of fictional , artistic or academic genres and is endowed with a 25,000 euro -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- prize .
winners within the last decade include philosopher juergen habermas , nigerian author chinua achebe and the german painter and sculptor anselm kiefer .
david grossman 's own career has ranged across several fields .
the son of a bus driver , he studied philosophy and theater before beginning a career in radio in israel .
for 14 years , he worked on a popular children 's radio program and published children 's books .
grossman first published a novel titled " the smile of the lamb " in 1983 that took up what later became the central theme of his engagement as an author and public figure : the relationship between israelis and palestinians .
from fiction to personal tragedy in may 2003 , grossman began a novel with a storyline that would eventually become the basis of tragedy within the author 's own family .
the book dealt with fears shared by many israeli parents about the lives of their sons .
grossman 's son jonathan had just finished his military service in 2003 , while his youngest son uri was preparing to begin service half of a year later .
the novel was still unfinished in 2006 , when uri was killed by hezbollah forces just before the end of the second lebanon war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellow israeli author amos oz won the german book trade peace prize in 1992 after his son 's death , grossman did n't know if he could bring himself to finish the book .
he shared that with his friend , colleague and fellow peace prize-winner amos oz , who told him , " the book will save you , david . "
in november 2006 , grossman stood before tens of thousands of demonstrators in tel aviv and gave expression to a dominant sentiment in the country : " one of the worst things the war did was to make it seem even more as though there is no king in israel these days and that our leadership is hollow , " he said .
" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
due to the holocaust , it was difficult for me to hear the language and travel there , " the writer said .
" when i began writing in israel , i said to myself , i can come to germany once a book has been published there under my name .
in my eyes , one of the most terrible things that happened during the holocaust is that the people were murdered anonymously and had no names . "

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .

david grossman is the winner of this year 's peace prize of the german book trade . on sunday , as part of the frankfurt book fair , david grossman is to receive this year 's peace prize of the german book trade , an annual award honoring figures whose work advances the cause of peace .
" the committee honors the israeli writer david grossman , who has actively shown his commitment to the cause of reconciliation between the israelis and the palestinians , " the judge 's association said .
" in his novels , essays and short stories he seeks to understand and to describe the attitude of the unlike-minded and not just his own view .
david grossmann gives a literary voice to the difficult task of living together , a voice that is heard around the world . "
grossman makes the impression of being shy and writes constantly , no matter where he is .
" writing a novel is the most complete experience that i know , and it takes three or four years .
it allows me to explore any possible place - whether in myself or even within other people that would otherwise be inaccessible to me , " he said .
although his books explore a variety of perspectives and have clear social dimensions , grossman said the audience plays no role in his writing process .
" when i write novels , i write them as though no one would read them .
that 's a very , very intimate act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grossman 's most recent publication in english is called " to the end of the land " a broad spectrum the peace prize of the german book trade is awarded to individuals active across a range of fictional , artistic or academic genres and is endowed with a 25,000 euro -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- prize .
winners within the last decade include philosopher juergen habermas , nigerian author chinua achebe and the german painter and sculptor anselm kiefer .
david grossman 's own career has ranged across several fields .
the son of a bus driver , he studied philosophy and theater before beginning a career in radio in israel .
for 14 years , he worked on a popular children 's radio program and published children 's books .
grossman first published a novel titled " the smile of the lamb " in 1983 that took up what later became the central theme of his engagement as an author and public figure : the relationship between israelis and palestinians .
from fiction to personal tragedy in may 2003 , grossman began a novel with a storyline that would eventually become the basis of tragedy within the author 's own family .
the book dealt with fears shared by many israeli parents about the lives of their sons .
grossman 's son jonathan had just finished his military service in 2003 , while his youngest son uri was preparing to begin service half of a year later .
the novel was still unfinished in 2006 , when uri was killed by hezbollah forces just before the end of the second lebanon war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellow israeli author amos oz won the german book trade peace prize in 1992 after his son 's death , grossman did n't know if he could bring himself to finish the book .
he shared that with his friend , colleague and fellow peace prize-winner amos oz , who told him , " the book will save you , david . "
in november 2006 , grossman stood before tens of thousands of demonstrators in tel aviv and gave expression to a dominant sentiment in the country : " one of the worst things the war did was to make it seem even more as though there is no king in israel these days and that our leadership is hollow , " he said .
" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
due to the holocaust , it was difficult for me to hear the language and travel there , " the writer said .
" when i began writing in israel , i said to myself , i can come to germany once a book has been published there under my name .
in my eyes , one of the most terrible things that happened during the holocaust is that the people were murdered anonymously and had no names . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellow israeli author amos oz won the german book trade peace prize in 1992 after his son 's death , grossman did n't know if he could bring himself to finish the book .
he shared that with his friend , colleague and fellow peace prize-winner amos oz , who told him , " the book will save you , david . "
in november 2006 , grossman stood before tens of thousands of demonstrators in tel aviv and gave expression to a dominant sentiment in the country : " one of the worst things the war did was to make it seem even more as though there is no king in israel these days and that our leadership is hollow , " he said .
" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
due to the holocaust , it was difficult for me to hear the language and travel there , " the writer said .
" when i began writing in israel , i said to myself , i can come to germany once a book has been published there under my name .
in my eyes , one of the most terrible things that happened during the holocaust is that the people were murdered anonymously and had no names . "

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

officials say the northern wall of an alumina plant reservoir could fail within days . workers in western hungary raced to build an emergency dam on sunday as cracks in a reservoir widened , threatening to unleash a second flood of toxic waste on the village of kolontar and nearby rivers .
officials have said it 's not a matter of if but when the northern wall will collapse .
environment state secretary zoltan illes said the crack , now 25 meters -lrb- 82 feet -rrb- in length , had widened slightly by sunday and that the damaged reservoir now looked to be beyond repair , according to hungarian news agency mti .
illes said the wall could collapse " within one day or a week . "
about 1,000 people were evacuated from kolontar on saturday , and emergency workers are rushing to complete a new dam to protect the town and the nearby community of devecser , home to 5,400 people .
on monday , about one million cubic meters of toxic red sludge leaked from an alumina plant reservoir , killing seven people , injuring 123 and polluting rivers including a local branch of the danube .
the highly alkaline sludge , a byproduct of alumina production , has a caustic effect on the skin .
it contains heavy metals , such as lead , and is slightly radioactive .
' race against time ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental critics have said the dam was weak for months before the disaster gyorgyi tottos , a spokeswoman for disaster crews , said authorities hoped to complete the 600-meter dam within days .
" this is a race against time as good weather is forecast for the coming few days but then the rain will come .
if we can have the dam finished by the time the rain comes , then it will be all right , " she said .
monday 's spill covered 1,017 hectares -lrb- 2,513 acres -rrb- , but tottos said the remaining sludge was thicker and could only spread over an area of about 500 to 1,000 meters from its origin .
prime minister viktor orban has described the spill as the worst ecological catastrophe in hungary 's history .
he said he will inform parliament on monday about the findings of an investigation and promised the " toughest possible consequences " to ensure such a disaster is not repeated .

" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

david grossman is the winner of this year 's peace prize of the german book trade . on sunday , as part of the frankfurt book fair , david grossman is to receive this year 's peace prize of the german book trade , an annual award honoring figures whose work advances the cause of peace .
" the committee honors the israeli writer david grossman , who has actively shown his commitment to the cause of reconciliation between the israelis and the palestinians , " the judge 's association said .
" in his novels , essays and short stories he seeks to understand and to describe the attitude of the unlike-minded and not just his own view .
david grossmann gives a literary voice to the difficult task of living together , a voice that is heard around the world . "
grossman makes the impression of being shy and writes constantly , no matter where he is .
" writing a novel is the most complete experience that i know , and it takes three or four years .
it allows me to explore any possible place - whether in myself or even within other people that would otherwise be inaccessible to me , " he said .
although his books explore a variety of perspectives and have clear social dimensions , grossman said the audience plays no role in his writing process .
" when i write novels , i write them as though no one would read them .
that 's a very , very intimate act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grossman 's most recent publication in english is called " to the end of the land " a broad spectrum the peace prize of the german book trade is awarded to individuals active across a range of fictional , artistic or academic genres and is endowed with a 25,000 euro -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- prize .
winners within the last decade include philosopher juergen habermas , nigerian author chinua achebe and the german painter and sculptor anselm kiefer .
david grossman 's own career has ranged across several fields .
the son of a bus driver , he studied philosophy and theater before beginning a career in radio in israel .
for 14 years , he worked on a popular children 's radio program and published children 's books .
grossman first published a novel titled " the smile of the lamb " in 1983 that took up what later became the central theme of his engagement as an author and public figure : the relationship between israelis and palestinians .
from fiction to personal tragedy in may 2003 , grossman began a novel with a storyline that would eventually become the basis of tragedy within the author 's own family .
the book dealt with fears shared by many israeli parents about the lives of their sons .
grossman 's son jonathan had just finished his military service in 2003 , while his youngest son uri was preparing to begin service half of a year later .
the novel was still unfinished in 2006 , when uri was killed by hezbollah forces just before the end of the second lebanon war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellow israeli author amos oz won the german book trade peace prize in 1992 after his son 's death , grossman did n't know if he could bring himself to finish the book .
he shared that with his friend , colleague and fellow peace prize-winner amos oz , who told him , " the book will save you , david . "
in november 2006 , grossman stood before tens of thousands of demonstrators in tel aviv and gave expression to a dominant sentiment in the country : " one of the worst things the war did was to make it seem even more as though there is no king in israel these days and that our leadership is hollow , " he said .
" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
due to the holocaust , it was difficult for me to hear the language and travel there , " the writer said .
" when i began writing in israel , i said to myself , i can come to germany once a book has been published there under my name .
in my eyes , one of the most terrible things that happened during the holocaust is that the people were murdered anonymously and had no names . "

the son of a bus driver , he studied philosophy and theater before beginning a career in radio in israel .
for 14 years , he worked on a popular children 's radio program and published children 's books .

" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
due to the holocaust , it was difficult for me to hear the language and travel there , " the writer said .
" when i began writing in israel , i said to myself , i can come to germany once a book has been published there under my name .
in my eyes , one of the most terrible things that happened during the holocaust is that the people were murdered anonymously and had no names . "

officials say the northern wall of an alumina plant reservoir could fail within days . workers in western hungary raced to build an emergency dam on sunday as cracks in a reservoir widened , threatening to unleash a second flood of toxic waste on the village of kolontar and nearby rivers .
officials have said it 's not a matter of if but when the northern wall will collapse .
environment state secretary zoltan illes said the crack , now 25 meters -lrb- 82 feet -rrb- in length , had widened slightly by sunday and that the damaged reservoir now looked to be beyond repair , according to hungarian news agency mti .
illes said the wall could collapse " within one day or a week . "
about 1,000 people were evacuated from kolontar on saturday , and emergency workers are rushing to complete a new dam to protect the town and the nearby community of devecser , home to 5,400 people .
on monday , about one million cubic meters of toxic red sludge leaked from an alumina plant reservoir , killing seven people , injuring 123 and polluting rivers including a local branch of the danube .
the highly alkaline sludge , a byproduct of alumina production , has a caustic effect on the skin .
it contains heavy metals , such as lead , and is slightly radioactive .
' race against time ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental critics have said the dam was weak for months before the disaster gyorgyi tottos , a spokeswoman for disaster crews , said authorities hoped to complete the 600-meter dam within days .
" this is a race against time as good weather is forecast for the coming few days but then the rain will come .
if we can have the dam finished by the time the rain comes , then it will be all right , " she said .
monday 's spill covered 1,017 hectares -lrb- 2,513 acres -rrb- , but tottos said the remaining sludge was thicker and could only spread over an area of about 500 to 1,000 meters from its origin .
prime minister viktor orban has described the spill as the worst ecological catastrophe in hungary 's history .
he said he will inform parliament on monday about the findings of an investigation and promised the " toughest possible consequences " to ensure such a disaster is not repeated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2010 germany 's first university course for imams opens in osnabrueck großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most imams in germany have been trained abroad osnabrueck university is paving the way for a growth in islamic studies with the aim of better integrating muslims into german society .
on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

david grossman is the winner of this year 's peace prize of the german book trade . on sunday , as part of the frankfurt book fair , david grossman is to receive this year 's peace prize of the german book trade , an annual award honoring figures whose work advances the cause of peace .
" the committee honors the israeli writer david grossman , who has actively shown his commitment to the cause of reconciliation between the israelis and the palestinians , " the judge 's association said .
" in his novels , essays and short stories he seeks to understand and to describe the attitude of the unlike-minded and not just his own view .
david grossmann gives a literary voice to the difficult task of living together , a voice that is heard around the world . "
grossman makes the impression of being shy and writes constantly , no matter where he is .
" writing a novel is the most complete experience that i know , and it takes three or four years .
it allows me to explore any possible place - whether in myself or even within other people that would otherwise be inaccessible to me , " he said .
although his books explore a variety of perspectives and have clear social dimensions , grossman said the audience plays no role in his writing process .
" when i write novels , i write them as though no one would read them .
that 's a very , very intimate act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grossman 's most recent publication in english is called " to the end of the land " a broad spectrum the peace prize of the german book trade is awarded to individuals active across a range of fictional , artistic or academic genres and is endowed with a 25,000 euro -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- prize .
winners within the last decade include philosopher juergen habermas , nigerian author chinua achebe and the german painter and sculptor anselm kiefer .
david grossman 's own career has ranged across several fields .
the son of a bus driver , he studied philosophy and theater before beginning a career in radio in israel .
for 14 years , he worked on a popular children 's radio program and published children 's books .
grossman first published a novel titled " the smile of the lamb " in 1983 that took up what later became the central theme of his engagement as an author and public figure : the relationship between israelis and palestinians .
from fiction to personal tragedy in may 2003 , grossman began a novel with a storyline that would eventually become the basis of tragedy within the author 's own family .
the book dealt with fears shared by many israeli parents about the lives of their sons .
grossman 's son jonathan had just finished his military service in 2003 , while his youngest son uri was preparing to begin service half of a year later .
the novel was still unfinished in 2006 , when uri was killed by hezbollah forces just before the end of the second lebanon war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fellow israeli author amos oz won the german book trade peace prize in 1992 after his son 's death , grossman did n't know if he could bring himself to finish the book .
he shared that with his friend , colleague and fellow peace prize-winner amos oz , who told him , " the book will save you , david . "
in november 2006 , grossman stood before tens of thousands of demonstrators in tel aviv and gave expression to a dominant sentiment in the country : " one of the worst things the war did was to make it seem even more as though there is no king in israel these days and that our leadership is hollow , " he said .
" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
due to the holocaust , it was difficult for me to hear the language and travel there , " the writer said .
" when i began writing in israel , i said to myself , i can come to germany once a book has been published there under my name .
in my eyes , one of the most terrible things that happened during the holocaust is that the people were murdered anonymously and had no names . "

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

the march has split the country , with the serbian orthodox church and some politicians speaking out against it . at least 110 people , most of them police , were injured and nearly 200 were arrested at serbia 's gay pride march in belgrade on sunday .
hundreds of opponents took on riot police with bricks , flares , bottles and molotov cocktails .
most of the injured were taken to hospital , trailed by hooligans who tried to enter the emergency room but were stopped by police .
more than 5,000 officers , backed up by police helicopters , sealed off the central streets in the serbian capital for the march .
rioters reportedly clashed with security at several locations , setting parked cars on fire , overturning garbage containers and destroying shop windows and street signs .
rioters also trashed the entrance to the serbian state television building rts and the seats of socialist party leader ivica dacic and the ruling democratic party , setting one part of the latter building on fire .
successful march bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters clashed with serbian police at several locations despite the violence , the actual parade went off smoothly .
around 500 gays , lesbians and supporters , including serbian and foreign officials , gathered for the short 15-minute march , some chanting , " we have succeeded . "
serbia 's gay community has tried on two previous occasions to organize a gay pride parade .
in 2001 , a planned parade was disrupted by violence before it could start , and last year the march was canceled at the last minute amid extremist threats .
the march has polarized the country , with some politicians supporting it and other groups , including the powerful serbian orthodox church , speaking out against it .
on saturday , thousands of opponents marched through belgrade calling for the parade to be canceled .
" this should not have happened , " one younger man told news agency dpa .
" i do not support the parade but trashing the city is pointless .
it is a sad image we are sending to the world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2010 activists aim for global record with climate protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests last year were held in south africa and 180 other countries the environmental group 350.org has set an ambitious goal for cutting carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere .
but the group 's european coordinator told deutsche welle the organization is n't overreaching . as 350.org stages events in 188 countries around the world on sunday , the group 's european coordinator , diana vogtel , told deutsche welle about the international protest event . deutsche welle : what is the scale of 350.org 's plans for this year 's event ? diana vogtel : as of a couple of days ago , we have already confirmed that the action on the october 10 will be bigger than last year 's event .
so far , over 7,000 campaigns and actions have been organized by local groups in 188 countries around the world . our lead event here in europe will be the big energy switching action in berlin . what do you mean by an energy switching action ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate will host sunday 's climate switching event it 's a symbolic event taking place at a site with a huge self-made renewable energy park on one side and a nuclear and coal-energy park on the other side .
we are inviting berlin citizens to come and symbolically switch from coal and nuclear energy to renewable energy sources . there will also be stalls and possibilities for citizens at the brandenburg gate to pull the actual switch on sunday .
we will also host a silent climate parade with around 350 ravers passing through different sites that already use renewable energy .
they 'll be listening to music on headphones to symbolize our politicians ' silence on the problem of climate change after copenhagen . what 's the significance of 350 in your organization 's name ? the number refers to 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
leading climate scientists tell us that 350 is the safe limit that we have to go back to in order to avoid the most catastrophic climate change events happening .
at the moment , we are already beyond 390 parts per million . other than the scientific background , we chose 350 since it 's a number that everyone can understand .
our goal is bringing together the global movement on climate change , so the name should be clear . given that carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere so long , how can we get back to this number ? this is exactly the reason why we 're hosting this big action on october 10th .
there are already thousands of climate solutions out there - we just need to put them into place .
but the window of opportunity to do so is closing .
that 's why we need to put the solutions in place right now to be able to actually still go back to 350 parts per million . we asked a lot of scientists to do research on this issue , and we found there is still a chance to act , but we need to act now .
this is why thousands of people will be going out on the streets and showing their politicians which climate change solutions they 've already put into place .
it 's a call to politicians to enact them on a national and global scale . your goal is significantly more ambitious than even the goal that many countries at the moment are struggling to agree on .
are you overreaching ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests marked 2009 's climate change conference and the 2 degree target 350 parts per million is a scientific goal , and the 2 degree goal -lsb- a goal to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsius over pre-industrial levels -rsb- is a political goal .
the difference is that the 2 degree goal is what politicians regard as politically possible . but what we always say is : you ca n't negotiate with our natural system , so we need to go to a scientific goal .
it 's not about overreaching .
we need to listen to scientists and what they tell us instead of deciding what 's economically or politically possible . politicians have been wrangling for years about the same issues on emissions targets and money .
do you really think they are going to stop pursuing their respective national interests and start listening to organizations like yours anytime soon ? we have been advocating for the 350 target now for quite a while , and actually over 100 delegations who were at the copenhagen talks said they support the 350 goal .
obviously , these are the states most concerned about climate change because it is already happening there . we are convinced that we need to show our politicians that it 's not just about national interests .
it 's about global interests .
we need to show them that the citizens are actually ready to go down this path and support sustainable solutions . interview : nathan witkop editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.10.2010 activists aim for global record with climate protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests last year were held in south africa and 180 other countries the environmental group 350.org has set an ambitious goal for cutting carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere .
but the group 's european coordinator told deutsche welle the organization is n't overreaching . as 350.org stages events in 188 countries around the world on sunday , the group 's european coordinator , diana vogtel , told deutsche welle about the international protest event . deutsche welle : what is the scale of 350.org 's plans for this year 's event ? diana vogtel : as of a couple of days ago , we have already confirmed that the action on the october 10 will be bigger than last year 's event .
so far , over 7,000 campaigns and actions have been organized by local groups in 188 countries around the world . our lead event here in europe will be the big energy switching action in berlin . what do you mean by an energy switching action ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate will host sunday 's climate switching event it 's a symbolic event taking place at a site with a huge self-made renewable energy park on one side and a nuclear and coal-energy park on the other side .
we are inviting berlin citizens to come and symbolically switch from coal and nuclear energy to renewable energy sources . there will also be stalls and possibilities for citizens at the brandenburg gate to pull the actual switch on sunday .
we will also host a silent climate parade with around 350 ravers passing through different sites that already use renewable energy .
they 'll be listening to music on headphones to symbolize our politicians ' silence on the problem of climate change after copenhagen . what 's the significance of 350 in your organization 's name ? the number refers to 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
leading climate scientists tell us that 350 is the safe limit that we have to go back to in order to avoid the most catastrophic climate change events happening .
at the moment , we are already beyond 390 parts per million . other than the scientific background , we chose 350 since it 's a number that everyone can understand .
our goal is bringing together the global movement on climate change , so the name should be clear . given that carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere so long , how can we get back to this number ? this is exactly the reason why we 're hosting this big action on october 10th .
there are already thousands of climate solutions out there - we just need to put them into place .
but the window of opportunity to do so is closing .
that 's why we need to put the solutions in place right now to be able to actually still go back to 350 parts per million . we asked a lot of scientists to do research on this issue , and we found there is still a chance to act , but we need to act now .
this is why thousands of people will be going out on the streets and showing their politicians which climate change solutions they 've already put into place .
it 's a call to politicians to enact them on a national and global scale . your goal is significantly more ambitious than even the goal that many countries at the moment are struggling to agree on .
are you overreaching ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests marked 2009 's climate change conference and the 2 degree target 350 parts per million is a scientific goal , and the 2 degree goal -lsb- a goal to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsius over pre-industrial levels -rsb- is a political goal .
the difference is that the 2 degree goal is what politicians regard as politically possible . but what we always say is : you ca n't negotiate with our natural system , so we need to go to a scientific goal .
it 's not about overreaching .
we need to listen to scientists and what they tell us instead of deciding what 's economically or politically possible . politicians have been wrangling for years about the same issues on emissions targets and money .
do you really think they are going to stop pursuing their respective national interests and start listening to organizations like yours anytime soon ? we have been advocating for the 350 target now for quite a while , and actually over 100 delegations who were at the copenhagen talks said they support the 350 goal .
obviously , these are the states most concerned about climate change because it is already happening there . we are convinced that we need to show our politicians that it 's not just about national interests .
it 's about global interests .
we need to show them that the citizens are actually ready to go down this path and support sustainable solutions . interview : nathan witkop editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

but the group 's european coordinator told deutsche welle the organization is n't overreaching . as 350.org stages events in 188 countries around the world on sunday , the group 's european coordinator , diana vogtel , told deutsche welle about the international protest event . deutsche welle : what is the scale of 350.org 's plans for this year 's event ? diana vogtel : as of a couple of days ago , we have already confirmed that the action on the october 10 will be bigger than last year 's event .
so far , over 7,000 campaigns and actions have been organized by local groups in 188 countries around the world . our lead event here in europe will be the big energy switching action in berlin . what do you mean by an energy switching action ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate will host sunday 's climate switching event it 's a symbolic event taking place at a site with a huge self-made renewable energy park on one side and a nuclear and coal-energy park on the other side .
we are inviting berlin citizens to come and symbolically switch from coal and nuclear energy to renewable energy sources . there will also be stalls and possibilities for citizens at the brandenburg gate to pull the actual switch on sunday .
we will also host a silent climate parade with around 350 ravers passing through different sites that already use renewable energy .
they 'll be listening to music on headphones to symbolize our politicians ' silence on the problem of climate change after copenhagen . what 's the significance of 350 in your organization 's name ? the number refers to 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
leading climate scientists tell us that 350 is the safe limit that we have to go back to in order to avoid the most catastrophic climate change events happening .
at the moment , we are already beyond 390 parts per million . other than the scientific background , we chose 350 since it 's a number that everyone can understand .
our goal is bringing together the global movement on climate change , so the name should be clear . given that carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere so long , how can we get back to this number ? this is exactly the reason why we 're hosting this big action on october 10th .
there are already thousands of climate solutions out there - we just need to put them into place .
but the window of opportunity to do so is closing .
that 's why we need to put the solutions in place right now to be able to actually still go back to 350 parts per million . we asked a lot of scientists to do research on this issue , and we found there is still a chance to act , but we need to act now .
this is why thousands of people will be going out on the streets and showing their politicians which climate change solutions they 've already put into place .
it 's a call to politicians to enact them on a national and global scale . your goal is significantly more ambitious than even the goal that many countries at the moment are struggling to agree on .
are you overreaching ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests marked 2009 's climate change conference and the 2 degree target 350 parts per million is a scientific goal , and the 2 degree goal -lsb- a goal to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsius over pre-industrial levels -rsb- is a political goal .
the difference is that the 2 degree goal is what politicians regard as politically possible . but what we always say is : you ca n't negotiate with our natural system , so we need to go to a scientific goal .
it 's not about overreaching .
we need to listen to scientists and what they tell us instead of deciding what 's economically or politically possible . politicians have been wrangling for years about the same issues on emissions targets and money .
do you really think they are going to stop pursuing their respective national interests and start listening to organizations like yours anytime soon ? we have been advocating for the 350 target now for quite a while , and actually over 100 delegations who were at the copenhagen talks said they support the 350 goal .
obviously , these are the states most concerned about climate change because it is already happening there . we are convinced that we need to show our politicians that it 's not just about national interests .

" while the international monetary system has proved resilient , tensions and vulnerabilities remain as a result of widening global imbalances , continued volatile capital flows , exchange rate movements and issues related to the supply and accumulation of official reserves , " the imf panel said in a statement after its semi-annual meeting on saturday in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf stopped short of making specific suggestions the statement by the monetary and finance committee , the policy arm of the imf , stopped short , however , of any specific call on china or other nations to change policies of using undervalued currencies and the accumulation of reserves to boost exports . us warns of currency distortions us treasury secretary timothy geithner had said earlier that the imf " must strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation practices . " " excess reserve accumulation on a global scale is leading to serious distortions in the international monetary and financial system , " geithner added . european central bank president jean-claude trichet was , at least publicly , more upbeat and said that he saw cause for optimism . " i have full confidence that the international community will find the appropriate ways to cooperate , " he said at the close of the talks .
" we are very , very hostile to any so-called currency wars . " he said the meeting 's participants understood they had a " shared responsibility " to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility or imbalances . china bows to pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the undervalued yuan is likely to remain a touchy issue at the imf for some time china 's top central banker , zhou xiaochuan , rejected demands for a quick yuan revaluation , declaring that beijing would reform gradually , rather than engage in any kind of " shock therapy . "
the yuan would move slowly toward an " equilibrium level , " he added . zhou 's standpoint has supporters among many economists who argue that any sudden and sharp revaluation of the yuan would put a lot of chinese companies in the export sector out of business , triggering massive job losses and even social unrest . china appeared to bow to international pressure for a stronger currency in june , promising to let the yuan trade more freely against the dollar . but , since then , the yuan , also known as the renminbi , has gained only two percent against the greenback , angering us and european policymakers who say the yuan is undervalued by as much as 40 percent . author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials say the northern wall of an alumina plant reservoir could fail within days . workers in western hungary raced to build an emergency dam on sunday as cracks in a reservoir widened , threatening to unleash a second flood of toxic waste on the village of kolontar and nearby rivers .
officials have said it 's not a matter of if but when the northern wall will collapse .
environment state secretary zoltan illes said the crack , now 25 meters -lrb- 82 feet -rrb- in length , had widened slightly by sunday and that the damaged reservoir now looked to be beyond repair , according to hungarian news agency mti .
illes said the wall could collapse " within one day or a week . "
about 1,000 people were evacuated from kolontar on saturday , and emergency workers are rushing to complete a new dam to protect the town and the nearby community of devecser , home to 5,400 people .
on monday , about one million cubic meters of toxic red sludge leaked from an alumina plant reservoir , killing seven people , injuring 123 and polluting rivers including a local branch of the danube .
the highly alkaline sludge , a byproduct of alumina production , has a caustic effect on the skin .
it contains heavy metals , such as lead , and is slightly radioactive .
' race against time ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental critics have said the dam was weak for months before the disaster gyorgyi tottos , a spokeswoman for disaster crews , said authorities hoped to complete the 600-meter dam within days .
" this is a race against time as good weather is forecast for the coming few days but then the rain will come .
if we can have the dam finished by the time the rain comes , then it will be all right , " she said .
monday 's spill covered 1,017 hectares -lrb- 2,513 acres -rrb- , but tottos said the remaining sludge was thicker and could only spread over an area of about 500 to 1,000 meters from its origin .
prime minister viktor orban has described the spill as the worst ecological catastrophe in hungary 's history .
he said he will inform parliament on monday about the findings of an investigation and promised the " toughest possible consequences " to ensure such a disaster is not repeated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2010 germany 's first university course for imams opens in osnabrueck großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most imams in germany have been trained abroad osnabrueck university is paving the way for a growth in islamic studies with the aim of better integrating muslims into german society .
on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2010 germany 's first university course for imams opens in osnabrueck großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most imams in germany have been trained abroad osnabrueck university is paving the way for a growth in islamic studies with the aim of better integrating muslims into german society .
on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .

on monday , 30 students will attend the first course devoted to training imams . germany ’ s first public higher education program for imams gets underway at the university of osnabrueck in northwest germany on monday , with the explicit hope of improving the integration of germany ’ s four million muslims .
the course will train muslim spiritual leaders over two semesters in german language skills , islamic theology and religious education . martina blasberg-kuhnke , vice-president of the university of osnabrueck , thinks the course can contribute to helping muslim communities to integrate .
" imams play a pivotal role because they work with their communities , their religion and with society at large , so they have a public function like priests and other community leaders , " she told deutsche welle . " they have a big influence on family life and the way practicing muslims choose to live their lives , and that 's why they 're particularly important . "
at the moment there is space for just 30 students in the course , although nearly three times that number expressed an interest in taking part .
currently most imams are educated in turkey , speak little german and are unfamiliar with western european culture .
islam is ' part of germany ' " integration " is the current buzzword in german politics .
earlier this summer , thilo sarrazin , a prominent german banker , sparked public outrage with the publication of his book , " germany abolishes itself . "
in it he claimed the country was being undermined by poorly educated and unproductive muslim immigrants .
though sarrazin may have been forced to resign , the debate continued .
at the beginning of october , german president christian wulff marked the 20th anniversary of german reunification with a speech about integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imams play a pivotal role in the muslim community " christianity is without a doubt part of germany , " wulff said in his address .
" judaism is without a doubt part of germany .
that 's our judeo-christian history … but in the meantime , islam is also part of germany . "
while representatives of germany 's muslim community welcomed the remarks , others said the president was letting muslims off the hook when it comes to integrating into german society .
chancellor angela merkel distanced herself from wulff 's comments , saying german culture was based on judeo-christian roots , and that all communities must comply with german law .
merkel also stressed the need for imams to be trained within germany so as to relate better with young muslims growing up in the country .
departments for islamic studies others are hoping that departments for islamic studies will become an established part of academia in germany . peter strohschneider , chairman of the german council of science and humanities , which advises the government on higher education , thinks this single course does not go far enough .
" the development of islamic theology could fulfill several functions at once , " strohschneider said .
" it would include professional training for religious studies teachers , training for imams - who are community leaders - and also create a new generation of islamic theologians . "
osnabrueck is the first of a number of universities to expand their provision for islamic studies .
universities in tuebingen , muenster and frankfurt are also planning to introduce similar programs .
the hope is that muslim theologians will become better integrated into the academic landscape in germany , and that this will have a knock-on effect on the wider muslim community .

david grossman is the winner of this year 's peace prize of the german book trade . on sunday , as part of the frankfurt book fair , david grossman is to receive this year 's peace prize of the german book trade , an annual award honoring figures whose work advances the cause of peace .
" the committee honors the israeli writer david grossman , who has actively shown his commitment to the cause of reconciliation between the israelis and the palestinians , " the judge 's association said .
" in his novels , essays and short stories he seeks to understand and to describe the attitude of the unlike-minded and not just his own view .
david grossmann gives a literary voice to the difficult task of living together , a voice that is heard around the world . "
grossman makes the impression of being shy and writes constantly , no matter where he is .
" writing a novel is the most complete experience that i know , and it takes three or four years .
it allows me to explore any possible place - whether in myself or even within other people that would otherwise be inaccessible to me , " he said .

the son of a bus driver , he studied philosophy and theater before beginning a career in radio in israel .
for 14 years , he worked on a popular children 's radio program and published children 's books .
grossman first published a novel titled " the smile of the lamb " in 1983 that took up what later became the central theme of his engagement as an author and public figure : the relationship between israelis and palestinians .
from fiction to personal tragedy in may 2003 , grossman began a novel with a storyline that would eventually become the basis of tragedy within the author 's own family .
the book dealt with fears shared by many israeli parents about the lives of their sons .
grossman 's son jonathan had just finished his military service in 2003 , while his youngest son uri was preparing to begin service half of a year later .
the novel was still unfinished in 2006 , when uri was killed by hezbollah forces just before the end of the second lebanon war .

he shared that with his friend , colleague and fellow peace prize-winner amos oz , who told him , " the book will save you , david . "
in november 2006 , grossman stood before tens of thousands of demonstrators in tel aviv and gave expression to a dominant sentiment in the country : " one of the worst things the war did was to make it seem even more as though there is no king in israel these days and that our leadership is hollow , " he said .
" our military and political leadership is hollow . "
difficult reconciliation with germany although he is appearing sunday at the frankfurt book fair to receive the honor , grossman recalls that reconciling himself with germany was difficult .
" for many years , i refused to come to germany .
