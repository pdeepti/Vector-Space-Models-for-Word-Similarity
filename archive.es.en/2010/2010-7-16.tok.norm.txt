maybe he got cold tentacles after receiving death-threat e-mails by irate soccer fans .
but , as andy valvur points out in this postcard , paul 's real career is only about to begin . there is an old american saying - quit while you 're ahead !
and that is indeed what paul the octopus has done after his electrifying performance of picking eight winners during the world cup football matches . but what does a retired bookmaking octopus do ?
will life at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , germany be enough ?
hardly . let 's face it , once you 're the toast of the tank it 's hard to walk away .
you get used to being invited to all the best aquarium parties and having eight squid supermodels cling to your every tentacle .
and it is n't often that sharks , who would never think twice about making you dinner , now want to buy you dinner .
and though you love it , you ca n't sign enough autographs . but you do n't have to worry about paul , his people ... oh yeah ... he has people now ... are busy capitalizing on his fame . according to deadline hollywood , paul sold a book about his life to random house .
and no sooner was his ink dry ... than universal studios snapped up the movie rights .
but hollywood being hollywood , there are , of course , complications .
paul , naturally , wants to play himself in the movie , but universal wants brad pitt .
the lawyers are talking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy valvur predicts a rosy future for paul rolling stone magazine said paul was spotted being carried into abbey road studios in london the other day where unnamed sources said he is recording a hip-hop version of the beatles classic octopus 's garden with ringo starr , jay-z , eminem and beyonce . news of the world has a report , which has been vehemently denied by paul 's pr reps , that he is going to establish an octopus breeding farm in kentucky called " octopussy . " next , women 's wear daily reports that puff daddy 's clothing company sean jean has contracted paul to design a line of hip-hop casual wear called " sucka . " and that is just his first week in " retirement . " so ... no , you do n't have to worry about paul the octopus .
his career is just starting .
and i have a feeling that it will be just a matter of time before his name turns up on one of those stolen cd 's from a swiss bank . author : andy valvur editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the osce has said it will send a team to watch over the peace . kyrgyzstan 's interim president roza otunbayeva on friday invited international investigators to come to the country and examine the causes behind ethnic clashes that may have left as many as 2,000 people dead last month .
the official toll is 316 . in a joint press conference with german foreign minister guido westerwelle and his french counterpart bernard kouchner , otunbayeva said the next step would be to decide which international group would carry out the inquiry . " then we want to get started quickly , " the interim president said . otunbayeva 's agreement comes after the german foreign minister made an explicit call for an investigation on his arrival in the capital bishkek earlier on friday . " we will only achieve stability when the causes are explained , " westerwelle said .
" that 's why it 's necessary for there to be an independent international investigation , so that we can identify those who are really guilty . " decision possible on saturday westerwelle and kouchner are both pushing to establish a fact-finding mission at a meeting of foreign ministers from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- in the city of almaty in nearby kazakhstan on saturday . kouchner made his intention to arrange an investigation into the kyrgyzstan violence clear in the run up to friday 's meeting , saying " we will make a decision tomorrow .

" when you see the burnt down houses and when you talk to the people , you get an idea of the difficult days , weeks , and months these people have been through , " westerwelle said . the southern city of osh was at the epicenter of the violence , and many houses there are still uninhabitable , with people living in tents as the authorities scramble to rebuild . author : mark hallam -lrb- dpa , apn -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .
" we are convinced that the japanese , not only as consumers , but also as taxpayers and industrial partners , will be better off for it . "

however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .

guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .

earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .

rather than demonstrate any remorse for his evident faux-pas , the conductor insisted that the compartment , complete with 20 or so foldaway seats , was reserved for bicycles only .
the disabled man would have to find somewhere else to park his two wheels . that , i thought , is taking cycling too seriously .
and just for a moment , i considered joining the other side and getting myself a car . author : tamsin walker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.07.2010 sudan 's path to referendum fraught with obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan is currently united under one flag .
but for how long ?
north and south sudanese leaders have begun talks on a strategy for a peaceful transition should a 2011 referendum result in the south gaining its independence .
but experts say time is running out to clarify all points . in six months time , sudan will vote in an historic referendum on whether the war-scarred south will gain independence .
but leaders from the north and south have a substantial number of details to clarify before the january 2011 vote .
" there 's a huge area to cover , but politicians on both sides realize that whatever happens at the referendum , they 're going to have to work out how the relationship is going to be framed in the future , " said roger middleton , a researcher in the african program of london-based think tank chatham house .
talks to continue talks between president omar al-bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- and the former southern rebel sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- kicked off in khartoum last weekend and were due to continue on july 19 .
the negotiations are focusing on how to ensure a peaceful transition after the referendum , in which the south is expected to vote in favor of self-rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omar al-bashir voted in the election , which observers called ' chaotic ' the referendum is part of the comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- , signed in january 2005 between the ncp and splm , which ended decades of civil war in sudan .
according to middleton , the parties are aware of the difficult task they face .
" they know the costs of going back to war are huge - for both sides , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's a huge codependency they have on peace . "
but elke grawert , a political scientist and sudan expert at the university of bremen , said it was unlikely that all points of discussion will be fully clarified in time .
" i think they will make some progress in resolving the issues , but it is imperative that the parties aim for a post-referendum process in which further negotiations take place , " grawert told deutsche welle .
oil is the crux four key issues are on the agenda for the talks over the next months : sharing oil resources , citizenship , security and respect of international agreements .
but observers agree that the pivotal point will be oil , as it plays a major role in sudan 's economy .
in addition to the referendum on southern independence , the oil-rich abyei region will also vote in january on which side to join .
according to the international monetary fund , oil now accounts for about 95 percent of sudan 's exports and over half of all government revenue .
most oil reserves are located in southern sudan , but the region is totally dependent on northern pipelines to funnel its crude to the red sea .
an agreement to share oil revenues was a key aspect of the cpa .
however , how these revenues should be split in the future poses a particular challenge after the referendum , said amy barry from the non-governmental organization global witness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the peace accord was signed in 2005 , many sudanese rejoiced .
" it 's a real catch-22 situation , " barry said .
" if the south , which is landlocked , decides on independence at the referendum , which it is expected to do , it will be almost entirely dependent on the north in order to export its oil .
so how are they going to ensure a fair and transparent oil deal post-january 2011 ? "
in an interview with deutsche welle , barry said preparations for a new deal have been " very inadequate . "
but more transparency was necessary in order to enable peace to last in a post-referendum situation .
grawert agreed that the handling of the oil resources required precise contracts .
" the course needs to be set for economic and political cooperation between both parts of the country , as they already now are economically linked , " said grawert , who heads the international research project " governance and social action in sudan after the peace agreement of january 2005 " with partners from universities in sudan , ethiopia and kenya .
the cpa expires six months after the referendum .
all interim agreements will run out at that time .
international pressure there are other key issues that need to be dealt with .
grawert pointed out that the future border between north and south left many questions open .
" what does that mean for nomadic tribes that are used to wandering between northern and southern sudan , in particular cattle breeders ? " she said .
" and what about citizenship issues ? "
overall , sudan is " alarmingly unprepared " for the critical referendum , according to a report by a global coalition of 26 humanitarian and human rights organizations published this week .
inadequate preparation was harming the chance of a credible vote on january 9 , 2011 .
role of the african union " the clock is ticking fast towards what might be the most important date in modern sudanese history , " the report " renewing the pledge : re-engaging the guarantors to the sudanese comprehensive peace agreement " said .
the cpa 's guarantors include the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , european union , united nations and the united states .
barry from global witness , which is part of this global coalition , said african leaders in particular had a key role to play in ensuring transparency .
the au will be holding its annual summit in uganda beginning monday .
" it 's a political signal that could be very usefully sent from the african summit in uganda , " barry said .
" the joint coalition report calls for them to reaffirm their support for the right of the southern sudanese to self-determination .
they should pledge to recognize the outcome of a free and fair referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil will be a pivotal point in sudenese talks middleton from chatham house said it was in the interest of the au to observe developments .
but how much the body needed to be involved would depend not so much on the actual agreements that are reached , but on the " feeling " between the two sides .
" i think if agreements are reached in an openness and generousness between north and south , that makes for a much more positive relationship going forward , " middleton said .
" if agreements are done grudgingly , the international community is going to want to be there to put more pressure on the two states to avoid situations which might revert to war . "
transparency will be crucial elections held in sudan in april of this year were viewed as a test run for the upcoming referendum .
the carter center , founded by former us president jimmy carter , monitored the process .
it concluded that the vote - which declared president al-bashir the winner - was " chaotic , non-transparent and vulnerable to electoral manipulation . "
should such lack of transparency also be observed at the january referendum , it could have disastrous consequences for the country , said alfred lokuji , an expert of the peace process based in southern sudan . "
northern sudan can ignore a vote for secession and claim that it was all rigged and if it 's a vote for unity , southern sudan can say it was all rigged , " lokuji told deutsche welle .
" whatever you do , you run into risks unless it 's well organized and as transparent as it possibly can be made . "
discussions are ' a good sign ' the current talks between the ncp and splm are a first step .
middleton said he was " cautiously optimistic " on progress .
" the fact that they 're talking is a good sign , " he said .
" of course , it 's much later than would have been ideal .
it would have been great if they 'd started these conversations a year ago rather than with months until the referendum .
but at least they 're doing it . "
and it appears they will not be marred by an arrest warrant against president al-bashir .
the international criminal court in the hague issued a second warrant this week on charges of genocide .

in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .

maybe he got cold tentacles after receiving death-threat e-mails by irate soccer fans .
but , as andy valvur points out in this postcard , paul 's real career is only about to begin . there is an old american saying - quit while you 're ahead !
and that is indeed what paul the octopus has done after his electrifying performance of picking eight winners during the world cup football matches . but what does a retired bookmaking octopus do ?
will life at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , germany be enough ?
hardly . let 's face it , once you 're the toast of the tank it 's hard to walk away .
you get used to being invited to all the best aquarium parties and having eight squid supermodels cling to your every tentacle .
and it is n't often that sharks , who would never think twice about making you dinner , now want to buy you dinner .
and though you love it , you ca n't sign enough autographs . but you do n't have to worry about paul , his people ... oh yeah ... he has people now ... are busy capitalizing on his fame . according to deadline hollywood , paul sold a book about his life to random house .
and no sooner was his ink dry ... than universal studios snapped up the movie rights .
but hollywood being hollywood , there are , of course , complications .
paul , naturally , wants to play himself in the movie , but universal wants brad pitt .
the lawyers are talking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy valvur predicts a rosy future for paul rolling stone magazine said paul was spotted being carried into abbey road studios in london the other day where unnamed sources said he is recording a hip-hop version of the beatles classic octopus 's garden with ringo starr , jay-z , eminem and beyonce . news of the world has a report , which has been vehemently denied by paul 's pr reps , that he is going to establish an octopus breeding farm in kentucky called " octopussy . " next , women 's wear daily reports that puff daddy 's clothing company sean jean has contracted paul to design a line of hip-hop casual wear called " sucka . " and that is just his first week in " retirement . " so ... no , you do n't have to worry about paul the octopus .

maybe he got cold tentacles after receiving death-threat e-mails by irate soccer fans .
but , as andy valvur points out in this postcard , paul 's real career is only about to begin . there is an old american saying - quit while you 're ahead !
and that is indeed what paul the octopus has done after his electrifying performance of picking eight winners during the world cup football matches . but what does a retired bookmaking octopus do ?
will life at sea life aquarium in oberhausen , germany be enough ?
hardly . let 's face it , once you 're the toast of the tank it 's hard to walk away .
you get used to being invited to all the best aquarium parties and having eight squid supermodels cling to your every tentacle .
and it is n't often that sharks , who would never think twice about making you dinner , now want to buy you dinner .
and though you love it , you ca n't sign enough autographs . but you do n't have to worry about paul , his people ... oh yeah ... he has people now ... are busy capitalizing on his fame . according to deadline hollywood , paul sold a book about his life to random house .
and no sooner was his ink dry ... than universal studios snapped up the movie rights .
but hollywood being hollywood , there are , of course , complications .
paul , naturally , wants to play himself in the movie , but universal wants brad pitt .
the lawyers are talking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy valvur predicts a rosy future for paul rolling stone magazine said paul was spotted being carried into abbey road studios in london the other day where unnamed sources said he is recording a hip-hop version of the beatles classic octopus 's garden with ringo starr , jay-z , eminem and beyonce . news of the world has a report , which has been vehemently denied by paul 's pr reps , that he is going to establish an octopus breeding farm in kentucky called " octopussy . " next , women 's wear daily reports that puff daddy 's clothing company sean jean has contracted paul to design a line of hip-hop casual wear called " sucka . " and that is just his first week in " retirement . " so ... no , you do n't have to worry about paul the octopus .

rights activists have sharply criticized the bill , which they say could be abused . the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , has approved a bill empowering the country 's secret police , the fsb , to call citizens in for " precautionary talks " for potential crimes agents believe may be committed in the future . under the law , fsb officials would require no evidence to take such action , which proponents of the new powers have said would be intended to prevent the possibility of a later criminal act " against the country 's security . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev spearheaded the fsb initiative the bill had been proposed by president dmitry medvedev and passed the 450-seat lower house of parliament with 354 votes .
most of the supporters were from the ruling united russia party . the country 's upper house , the federation council , must approve the bill before it can be sent to medvedev , whose signature would turn it into law . return of kgb ? but in an open letter to the council , democracy and rights groups have denounced the bill , saying it would herald in a return to conditions under the kgb , the soviet-era predecessor to the fsb . critics have said the powers could be used to intimidate government opponents and suppress protests .
in fact , three activists from the opposition yabloko party were arrested outside the duma for protesting the law as it was passed . signatories of the letter include the president of the moscow bar association , genry reznik ; the chairwoman of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva ; the head of the russian human rights organization memorial , oleg orlov ; as well as writers and members of the opposition . change in atmosphere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the bill have said it gives too much power to agents in the fsb headquarters an 80-year-old veteran human rights campaigner sergei kovalyov said he believes the authorities are afraid of mass unrest , like the 2004 orange revolution in ukraine .
he said there has not been a particular reason or event that necessitates giving extra powers to the security services . " nobody can mention a particular event , because a change in atmosphere is not an event , " kovalyov said .
" but we all feel it .
and -lsb- the bill 's initiators -rsb- are without any doubt the people who are in power , for no-one else can initiate such measures .
they also feel this change in atmosphere . " medvedev , meanwhile , defended the bill .
when questions were raised about the bill during a press conference with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday in yekaterinburg , medvedev , reluctant at first to address the subject , said it was perfectly normal for a country to update security policy . " every country has the right to improve its laws , including those on the security services , and we will do that , " medvedev said .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .
" we are convinced that the japanese , not only as consumers , but also as taxpayers and industrial partners , will be better off for it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 16.07.2010 bangladesh garment workers fight for higher wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a garment worker argues with policemen during a protest in dhaka in bangladesh , textile workers who produce clothes for western brands are fighting for an immediate pay rise .
violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

dw fans wrote in to side with michael ballack or philipp lahm in the discussion on who should captain the nationalelf . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics have pointed the finger at misfiring plans to float the company on the stock market . travelling on germany 's high-speed ice trains has often been a harrowing experience recently .
horror stories circulated in the german media throughout the week , following an incident saturday when the air-conditioning broke down in a train travelling from berlin .
temperatures reached 50 degrees celsius -lrb- 122 degrees f -rrb- inside the train , and several people were hospitalized in the western german town of bielefeld . " a conductor came into our compartment with a doctor because a young boy was lying on the floor numb , " one anonymous passenger told reporters .
" his mother was really worried .
then she tried to smash a window , but thank god someone stopped her .
it was like in a disaster movie . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grube has just sanctioned a hugely expensive foreign takeover after initial claims that the air-conditioning breakdowns had only affected three trains on that day , reports have since emerged that germany 's current heat wave has disabled the air conditioning on as many as 50 trains this week . finally coming clean as a result deutsche bahn has been forced to admit that the cooling systems installed in some high-speed trains are simply not equipped to cope with the current heat .
when outside temperatures breach 32 degrees celsius , the systems on ice 2 trains routinely fail to keep the interior cool .
deutsche bahn chief ruediger grube was quick to apologize for the mess , but pointed the finger at climate change . " we have of course analyzed the weather situation in connection with the air conditioning system , " he said .
" and we found that in the last 20 years , only five days were hotter than 37 degrees .
three of those days happened last weekend . " deutsche bahn 's argument is that air conditioning standards - last set in the early 1990s - simply do not predict the kind of weather that has scorched much of europe in the last two weeks .
the company quickly added that the newer ice trains already had an air conditioning system that could cope with 35-degree heat , and that the next generation of ice 's - planned to start running next year - would take up to 40 degrees . cutting corners to boost stock market value bildunterschrift : dozens of people needed medical attention at bielefeld railway station but winfried wolf , a transport industry expert and long-time critic of deutsche bahn , said he believes the problem is part of an endemic drive to cut maintenance corners . " you know it 's going to be warmer than 32 degrees in the summer , " he said .
" and if you then do things like invest over a 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- in a general overhaul but leave the air conditioning systems in , then that is simply irresponsible .
this morning grube just said they are considering putting in new systems . " wolf said he believes the maintenance problem is a direct result of the failed plan to float the company on the stock market .
this idea has been mooted for many years , and has led to expensive foreign investments to boost the image of the company . " a week ago , grube made the decision a week ago to buy european bus and rail operator arriva , " wolf said , " for nearly 3 billion euros and not to invest this money in the improvement of the domestic rail service . " according to the coalition contract the german government made last october , deutsche bahn is still intended for the stock market , as soon as market conditions improve .
meanwhile , german rail passengers are bracing themselves for another hot weekend . author : ben knight editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 16.07.2010 bangladesh garment workers fight for higher wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a garment worker argues with policemen during a protest in dhaka in bangladesh , textile workers who produce clothes for western brands are fighting for an immediate pay rise .
violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : germans work to retain control of online personal information generational gap divides opinion on internet privacy merkel 's home to appear on google street view facebook , google use in germany stays high despite privacy inquiries german foreign minister joins criticism of google 's mapping program privacy -pipe- 16.07.2010 long-standing german tradition of data protection simply carrying on , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german privacy laws need to meld with other nations ' laws german officials have accused google and facebook of privacy and data protection violations .
according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

dw fans wrote in to side with michael ballack or philipp lahm in the discussion on who should captain the nationalelf . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "
the state premier of bavaria , of which munich is the capital , promptly rebuffed bogner 's negative stance in a news conference after the meeting , demanding a " first-class bid " instead .
squabbling and protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants a " first-class bid " for munich premier horst seehofer is keen to end squabbling between bogner , the state of bavaria , munich and the ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen , which is crucial to the bid because of its snowy alps .
" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .
locals in garmisch-partenkirchen and munich are concerned about the damage the olympics could do to the environment as well as the attitude of bogner and his team .
" mr. bogner and his bid committee are unbelievably patronizing to residents .
they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .
at some point the situation will just erupt , ” said alex doering , who is involved in the anti-olympic initiative nolympia 2018 .
a referendum held two weeks ago in oberammergau , about 10 kilometers north of garmisch-partenkirchen , already toppled plans for the town to host the biathlon and cross-country races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen is crucial to munich 's bid soccer support on the bright side , german bundesliga football champions bayern munich have thrown their support behind munich 's bid .
the team 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge has criticized opponents to the bid , saying he is irritated by the " obstructionists , " as he calls them .
since the beginning of the week , a petition against the bid has been circulating in garmisch-partenkirchen , but the organizers of the bid are confident that farmers in the area will permit the use of their land .
" the most important thing is that we speak their language , so they do n't have the feeling they are signing something under pressure , " joachim faerber , spokesman for munich 2018 , said after thursday 's meeting .
" -lsb- seehofer -rsb- and the lord mayor of munich were all confident after today 's meeting that the clouds are gone and the sun 's coming through , " he added .

in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .
chief among them is the protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- .
during her meetings with chinese government officials , merkel again stressed the need to respect patents . ' in the lion 's den ' while admitting that china has taken steps to curb ipr violation in the country , beilke said " copying remains an issue . "
and he speaks from experience . " we 're affected by it , " beilke said .
" but we still have to be in the lion 's den .
the market is too big . " trade between the export powerhouses has grown steadily , to 91 billion dollars last year compared with $ 41 billion in 2001 .
of last year 's total , chinese exports to germany accounted for $ 55 billion and germany 's exports to china for $ 36 billion . author : john blau editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "
the state premier of bavaria , of which munich is the capital , promptly rebuffed bogner 's negative stance in a news conference after the meeting , demanding a " first-class bid " instead .
squabbling and protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants a " first-class bid " for munich premier horst seehofer is keen to end squabbling between bogner , the state of bavaria , munich and the ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen , which is crucial to the bid because of its snowy alps .
" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .
locals in garmisch-partenkirchen and munich are concerned about the damage the olympics could do to the environment as well as the attitude of bogner and his team .
" mr. bogner and his bid committee are unbelievably patronizing to residents .
they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .
at some point the situation will just erupt , ” said alex doering , who is involved in the anti-olympic initiative nolympia 2018 .
a referendum held two weeks ago in oberammergau , about 10 kilometers north of garmisch-partenkirchen , already toppled plans for the town to host the biathlon and cross-country races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen is crucial to munich 's bid soccer support on the bright side , german bundesliga football champions bayern munich have thrown their support behind munich 's bid .
the team 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge has criticized opponents to the bid , saying he is irritated by the " obstructionists , " as he calls them .
since the beginning of the week , a petition against the bid has been circulating in garmisch-partenkirchen , but the organizers of the bid are confident that farmers in the area will permit the use of their land .
" the most important thing is that we speak their language , so they do n't have the feeling they are signing something under pressure , " joachim faerber , spokesman for munich 2018 , said after thursday 's meeting .
" -lsb- seehofer -rsb- and the lord mayor of munich were all confident after today 's meeting that the clouds are gone and the sun 's coming through , " he added .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.07.2010 sudan 's path to referendum fraught with obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan is currently united under one flag .
but for how long ?
north and south sudanese leaders have begun talks on a strategy for a peaceful transition should a 2011 referendum result in the south gaining its independence .
but experts say time is running out to clarify all points . in six months time , sudan will vote in an historic referendum on whether the war-scarred south will gain independence .
but leaders from the north and south have a substantial number of details to clarify before the january 2011 vote .
" there 's a huge area to cover , but politicians on both sides realize that whatever happens at the referendum , they 're going to have to work out how the relationship is going to be framed in the future , " said roger middleton , a researcher in the african program of london-based think tank chatham house .
talks to continue talks between president omar al-bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- and the former southern rebel sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- kicked off in khartoum last weekend and were due to continue on july 19 .
the negotiations are focusing on how to ensure a peaceful transition after the referendum , in which the south is expected to vote in favor of self-rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omar al-bashir voted in the election , which observers called ' chaotic ' the referendum is part of the comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- , signed in january 2005 between the ncp and splm , which ended decades of civil war in sudan .
according to middleton , the parties are aware of the difficult task they face .
" they know the costs of going back to war are huge - for both sides , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's a huge codependency they have on peace . "
but elke grawert , a political scientist and sudan expert at the university of bremen , said it was unlikely that all points of discussion will be fully clarified in time .
" i think they will make some progress in resolving the issues , but it is imperative that the parties aim for a post-referendum process in which further negotiations take place , " grawert told deutsche welle .
oil is the crux four key issues are on the agenda for the talks over the next months : sharing oil resources , citizenship , security and respect of international agreements .
but observers agree that the pivotal point will be oil , as it plays a major role in sudan 's economy .
in addition to the referendum on southern independence , the oil-rich abyei region will also vote in january on which side to join .
according to the international monetary fund , oil now accounts for about 95 percent of sudan 's exports and over half of all government revenue .
most oil reserves are located in southern sudan , but the region is totally dependent on northern pipelines to funnel its crude to the red sea .
an agreement to share oil revenues was a key aspect of the cpa .
however , how these revenues should be split in the future poses a particular challenge after the referendum , said amy barry from the non-governmental organization global witness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the peace accord was signed in 2005 , many sudanese rejoiced .
" it 's a real catch-22 situation , " barry said .
" if the south , which is landlocked , decides on independence at the referendum , which it is expected to do , it will be almost entirely dependent on the north in order to export its oil .
so how are they going to ensure a fair and transparent oil deal post-january 2011 ? "
in an interview with deutsche welle , barry said preparations for a new deal have been " very inadequate . "
but more transparency was necessary in order to enable peace to last in a post-referendum situation .
grawert agreed that the handling of the oil resources required precise contracts .
" the course needs to be set for economic and political cooperation between both parts of the country , as they already now are economically linked , " said grawert , who heads the international research project " governance and social action in sudan after the peace agreement of january 2005 " with partners from universities in sudan , ethiopia and kenya .
the cpa expires six months after the referendum .
all interim agreements will run out at that time .
international pressure there are other key issues that need to be dealt with .
grawert pointed out that the future border between north and south left many questions open .
" what does that mean for nomadic tribes that are used to wandering between northern and southern sudan , in particular cattle breeders ? " she said .
" and what about citizenship issues ? "
overall , sudan is " alarmingly unprepared " for the critical referendum , according to a report by a global coalition of 26 humanitarian and human rights organizations published this week .
inadequate preparation was harming the chance of a credible vote on january 9 , 2011 .
role of the african union " the clock is ticking fast towards what might be the most important date in modern sudanese history , " the report " renewing the pledge : re-engaging the guarantors to the sudanese comprehensive peace agreement " said .
the cpa 's guarantors include the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , european union , united nations and the united states .
barry from global witness , which is part of this global coalition , said african leaders in particular had a key role to play in ensuring transparency .
the au will be holding its annual summit in uganda beginning monday .
" it 's a political signal that could be very usefully sent from the african summit in uganda , " barry said .
" the joint coalition report calls for them to reaffirm their support for the right of the southern sudanese to self-determination .
they should pledge to recognize the outcome of a free and fair referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil will be a pivotal point in sudenese talks middleton from chatham house said it was in the interest of the au to observe developments .
but how much the body needed to be involved would depend not so much on the actual agreements that are reached , but on the " feeling " between the two sides .
" i think if agreements are reached in an openness and generousness between north and south , that makes for a much more positive relationship going forward , " middleton said .
" if agreements are done grudgingly , the international community is going to want to be there to put more pressure on the two states to avoid situations which might revert to war . "
transparency will be crucial elections held in sudan in april of this year were viewed as a test run for the upcoming referendum .
the carter center , founded by former us president jimmy carter , monitored the process .
it concluded that the vote - which declared president al-bashir the winner - was " chaotic , non-transparent and vulnerable to electoral manipulation . "
should such lack of transparency also be observed at the january referendum , it could have disastrous consequences for the country , said alfred lokuji , an expert of the peace process based in southern sudan . "
northern sudan can ignore a vote for secession and claim that it was all rigged and if it 's a vote for unity , southern sudan can say it was all rigged , " lokuji told deutsche welle .
" whatever you do , you run into risks unless it 's well organized and as transparent as it possibly can be made . "
discussions are ' a good sign ' the current talks between the ncp and splm are a first step .
middleton said he was " cautiously optimistic " on progress .
" the fact that they 're talking is a good sign , " he said .
" of course , it 's much later than would have been ideal .
it would have been great if they 'd started these conversations a year ago rather than with months until the referendum .
but at least they 're doing it . "
and it appears they will not be marred by an arrest warrant against president al-bashir .
the international criminal court in the hague issued a second warrant this week on charges of genocide .

dw fans wrote in to side with michael ballack or philipp lahm in the discussion on who should captain the nationalelf . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .
chief among them is the protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- .
during her meetings with chinese government officials , merkel again stressed the need to respect patents . ' in the lion 's den ' while admitting that china has taken steps to curb ipr violation in the country , beilke said " copying remains an issue . "
and he speaks from experience . " we 're affected by it , " beilke said .
" but we still have to be in the lion 's den .
the market is too big . " trade between the export powerhouses has grown steadily , to 91 billion dollars last year compared with $ 41 billion in 2001 .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .

in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .
chief among them is the protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- .
during her meetings with chinese government officials , merkel again stressed the need to respect patents . ' in the lion 's den ' while admitting that china has taken steps to curb ipr violation in the country , beilke said " copying remains an issue . "
and he speaks from experience . " we 're affected by it , " beilke said .
" but we still have to be in the lion 's den .
the market is too big . " trade between the export powerhouses has grown steadily , to 91 billion dollars last year compared with $ 41 billion in 2001 .
of last year 's total , chinese exports to germany accounted for $ 55 billion and germany 's exports to china for $ 36 billion . author : john blau editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

the osce has said it will send a team to watch over the peace . kyrgyzstan 's interim president roza otunbayeva on friday invited international investigators to come to the country and examine the causes behind ethnic clashes that may have left as many as 2,000 people dead last month .
the official toll is 316 . in a joint press conference with german foreign minister guido westerwelle and his french counterpart bernard kouchner , otunbayeva said the next step would be to decide which international group would carry out the inquiry . " then we want to get started quickly , " the interim president said . otunbayeva 's agreement comes after the german foreign minister made an explicit call for an investigation on his arrival in the capital bishkek earlier on friday . " we will only achieve stability when the causes are explained , " westerwelle said .
" that 's why it 's necessary for there to be an independent international investigation , so that we can identify those who are really guilty .

" when you see the burnt down houses and when you talk to the people , you get an idea of the difficult days , weeks , and months these people have been through , " westerwelle said . the southern city of osh was at the epicenter of the violence , and many houses there are still uninhabitable , with people living in tents as the authorities scramble to rebuild . author : mark hallam -lrb- dpa , apn -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 16.07.2010 germany loses export race but wins big customer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese consumers like kitchens " made in germany " after dethroning germany as the world 's top exporter , china is quietly becoming one of the country 's biggest customers for a wide range of products .
in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "
the state premier of bavaria , of which munich is the capital , promptly rebuffed bogner 's negative stance in a news conference after the meeting , demanding a " first-class bid " instead .
squabbling and protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants a " first-class bid " for munich premier horst seehofer is keen to end squabbling between bogner , the state of bavaria , munich and the ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen , which is crucial to the bid because of its snowy alps .
" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .
locals in garmisch-partenkirchen and munich are concerned about the damage the olympics could do to the environment as well as the attitude of bogner and his team .
" mr. bogner and his bid committee are unbelievably patronizing to residents .
they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .
at some point the situation will just erupt , ” said alex doering , who is involved in the anti-olympic initiative nolympia 2018 .
a referendum held two weeks ago in oberammergau , about 10 kilometers north of garmisch-partenkirchen , already toppled plans for the town to host the biathlon and cross-country races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen is crucial to munich 's bid soccer support on the bright side , german bundesliga football champions bayern munich have thrown their support behind munich 's bid .
the team 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge has criticized opponents to the bid , saying he is irritated by the " obstructionists , " as he calls them .
since the beginning of the week , a petition against the bid has been circulating in garmisch-partenkirchen , but the organizers of the bid are confident that farmers in the area will permit the use of their land .
" the most important thing is that we speak their language , so they do n't have the feeling they are signing something under pressure , " joachim faerber , spokesman for munich 2018 , said after thursday 's meeting .
" -lsb- seehofer -rsb- and the lord mayor of munich were all confident after today 's meeting that the clouds are gone and the sun 's coming through , " he added .

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .
" we are convinced that the japanese , not only as consumers , but also as taxpayers and industrial partners , will be better off for it . "

dw fans wrote in to side with michael ballack or philipp lahm in the discussion on who should captain the nationalelf . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics have pointed the finger at misfiring plans to float the company on the stock market . travelling on germany 's high-speed ice trains has often been a harrowing experience recently .
horror stories circulated in the german media throughout the week , following an incident saturday when the air-conditioning broke down in a train travelling from berlin .
temperatures reached 50 degrees celsius -lrb- 122 degrees f -rrb- inside the train , and several people were hospitalized in the western german town of bielefeld . " a conductor came into our compartment with a doctor because a young boy was lying on the floor numb , " one anonymous passenger told reporters .

when outside temperatures breach 32 degrees celsius , the systems on ice 2 trains routinely fail to keep the interior cool .
deutsche bahn chief ruediger grube was quick to apologize for the mess , but pointed the finger at climate change . " we have of course analyzed the weather situation in connection with the air conditioning system , " he said .
" and we found that in the last 20 years , only five days were hotter than 37 degrees .
three of those days happened last weekend . " deutsche bahn 's argument is that air conditioning standards - last set in the early 1990s - simply do not predict the kind of weather that has scorched much of europe in the last two weeks .
the company quickly added that the newer ice trains already had an air conditioning system that could cope with 35-degree heat , and that the next generation of ice 's - planned to start running next year - would take up to 40 degrees . cutting corners to boost stock market value bildunterschrift : dozens of people needed medical attention at bielefeld railway station but winfried wolf , a transport industry expert and long-time critic of deutsche bahn , said he believes the problem is part of an endemic drive to cut maintenance corners .

" and if you then do things like invest over a 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- in a general overhaul but leave the air conditioning systems in , then that is simply irresponsible .

but critics have pointed the finger at misfiring plans to float the company on the stock market . travelling on germany 's high-speed ice trains has often been a harrowing experience recently .
horror stories circulated in the german media throughout the week , following an incident saturday when the air-conditioning broke down in a train travelling from berlin .
temperatures reached 50 degrees celsius -lrb- 122 degrees f -rrb- inside the train , and several people were hospitalized in the western german town of bielefeld . " a conductor came into our compartment with a doctor because a young boy was lying on the floor numb , " one anonymous passenger told reporters .
" his mother was really worried .
then she tried to smash a window , but thank god someone stopped her .
it was like in a disaster movie . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grube has just sanctioned a hugely expensive foreign takeover after initial claims that the air-conditioning breakdowns had only affected three trains on that day , reports have since emerged that germany 's current heat wave has disabled the air conditioning on as many as 50 trains this week . finally coming clean as a result deutsche bahn has been forced to admit that the cooling systems installed in some high-speed trains are simply not equipped to cope with the current heat .
when outside temperatures breach 32 degrees celsius , the systems on ice 2 trains routinely fail to keep the interior cool .
deutsche bahn chief ruediger grube was quick to apologize for the mess , but pointed the finger at climate change . " we have of course analyzed the weather situation in connection with the air conditioning system , " he said .
" and we found that in the last 20 years , only five days were hotter than 37 degrees .
three of those days happened last weekend . " deutsche bahn 's argument is that air conditioning standards - last set in the early 1990s - simply do not predict the kind of weather that has scorched much of europe in the last two weeks .
the company quickly added that the newer ice trains already had an air conditioning system that could cope with 35-degree heat , and that the next generation of ice 's - planned to start running next year - would take up to 40 degrees . cutting corners to boost stock market value bildunterschrift : dozens of people needed medical attention at bielefeld railway station but winfried wolf , a transport industry expert and long-time critic of deutsche bahn , said he believes the problem is part of an endemic drive to cut maintenance corners . " you know it 's going to be warmer than 32 degrees in the summer , " he said .
" and if you then do things like invest over a 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- in a general overhaul but leave the air conditioning systems in , then that is simply irresponsible .
this morning grube just said they are considering putting in new systems . " wolf said he believes the maintenance problem is a direct result of the failed plan to float the company on the stock market .
this idea has been mooted for many years , and has led to expensive foreign investments to boost the image of the company . " a week ago , grube made the decision a week ago to buy european bus and rail operator arriva , " wolf said , " for nearly 3 billion euros and not to invest this money in the improvement of the domestic rail service . " according to the coalition contract the german government made last october , deutsche bahn is still intended for the stock market , as soon as market conditions improve .

in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .
chief among them is the protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- .
during her meetings with chinese government officials , merkel again stressed the need to respect patents . ' in the lion 's den ' while admitting that china has taken steps to curb ipr violation in the country , beilke said " copying remains an issue . "
and he speaks from experience . " we 're affected by it , " beilke said .
" but we still have to be in the lion 's den .
the market is too big . " trade between the export powerhouses has grown steadily , to 91 billion dollars last year compared with $ 41 billion in 2001 .
of last year 's total , chinese exports to germany accounted for $ 55 billion and germany 's exports to china for $ 36 billion . author : john blau editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .
" we are convinced that the japanese , not only as consumers , but also as taxpayers and industrial partners , will be better off for it . "

among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .
chief among them is the protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- .
during her meetings with chinese government officials , merkel again stressed the need to respect patents . ' in the lion 's den ' while admitting that china has taken steps to curb ipr violation in the country , beilke said " copying remains an issue . "
and he speaks from experience . " we 're affected by it , " beilke said .
" but we still have to be in the lion 's den .
the market is too big . " trade between the export powerhouses has grown steadily , to 91 billion dollars last year compared with $ 41 billion in 2001 .
of last year 's total , chinese exports to germany accounted for $ 55 billion and germany 's exports to china for $ 36 billion . author : john blau editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .
" we are convinced that the japanese , not only as consumers , but also as taxpayers and industrial partners , will be better off for it . "

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 16.07.2010 bangladesh garment workers fight for higher wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a garment worker argues with policemen during a protest in dhaka in bangladesh , textile workers who produce clothes for western brands are fighting for an immediate pay rise .
violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.07.2010 sudan 's path to referendum fraught with obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan is currently united under one flag .
but for how long ?
north and south sudanese leaders have begun talks on a strategy for a peaceful transition should a 2011 referendum result in the south gaining its independence .
but experts say time is running out to clarify all points . in six months time , sudan will vote in an historic referendum on whether the war-scarred south will gain independence .
but leaders from the north and south have a substantial number of details to clarify before the january 2011 vote .
" there 's a huge area to cover , but politicians on both sides realize that whatever happens at the referendum , they 're going to have to work out how the relationship is going to be framed in the future , " said roger middleton , a researcher in the african program of london-based think tank chatham house .
talks to continue talks between president omar al-bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- and the former southern rebel sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- kicked off in khartoum last weekend and were due to continue on july 19 .
the negotiations are focusing on how to ensure a peaceful transition after the referendum , in which the south is expected to vote in favor of self-rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omar al-bashir voted in the election , which observers called ' chaotic ' the referendum is part of the comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- , signed in january 2005 between the ncp and splm , which ended decades of civil war in sudan .
according to middleton , the parties are aware of the difficult task they face .
" they know the costs of going back to war are huge - for both sides , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's a huge codependency they have on peace . "
but elke grawert , a political scientist and sudan expert at the university of bremen , said it was unlikely that all points of discussion will be fully clarified in time .
" i think they will make some progress in resolving the issues , but it is imperative that the parties aim for a post-referendum process in which further negotiations take place , " grawert told deutsche welle .
oil is the crux four key issues are on the agenda for the talks over the next months : sharing oil resources , citizenship , security and respect of international agreements .
but observers agree that the pivotal point will be oil , as it plays a major role in sudan 's economy .
in addition to the referendum on southern independence , the oil-rich abyei region will also vote in january on which side to join .
according to the international monetary fund , oil now accounts for about 95 percent of sudan 's exports and over half of all government revenue .
most oil reserves are located in southern sudan , but the region is totally dependent on northern pipelines to funnel its crude to the red sea .
an agreement to share oil revenues was a key aspect of the cpa .
however , how these revenues should be split in the future poses a particular challenge after the referendum , said amy barry from the non-governmental organization global witness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the peace accord was signed in 2005 , many sudanese rejoiced .
" it 's a real catch-22 situation , " barry said .
" if the south , which is landlocked , decides on independence at the referendum , which it is expected to do , it will be almost entirely dependent on the north in order to export its oil .
so how are they going to ensure a fair and transparent oil deal post-january 2011 ? "
in an interview with deutsche welle , barry said preparations for a new deal have been " very inadequate . "
but more transparency was necessary in order to enable peace to last in a post-referendum situation .
grawert agreed that the handling of the oil resources required precise contracts .
" the course needs to be set for economic and political cooperation between both parts of the country , as they already now are economically linked , " said grawert , who heads the international research project " governance and social action in sudan after the peace agreement of january 2005 " with partners from universities in sudan , ethiopia and kenya .
the cpa expires six months after the referendum .
all interim agreements will run out at that time .
international pressure there are other key issues that need to be dealt with .
grawert pointed out that the future border between north and south left many questions open .
" what does that mean for nomadic tribes that are used to wandering between northern and southern sudan , in particular cattle breeders ? " she said .
" and what about citizenship issues ? "
overall , sudan is " alarmingly unprepared " for the critical referendum , according to a report by a global coalition of 26 humanitarian and human rights organizations published this week .
inadequate preparation was harming the chance of a credible vote on january 9 , 2011 .
role of the african union " the clock is ticking fast towards what might be the most important date in modern sudanese history , " the report " renewing the pledge : re-engaging the guarantors to the sudanese comprehensive peace agreement " said .
the cpa 's guarantors include the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , european union , united nations and the united states .
barry from global witness , which is part of this global coalition , said african leaders in particular had a key role to play in ensuring transparency .
the au will be holding its annual summit in uganda beginning monday .
" it 's a political signal that could be very usefully sent from the african summit in uganda , " barry said .
" the joint coalition report calls for them to reaffirm their support for the right of the southern sudanese to self-determination .
they should pledge to recognize the outcome of a free and fair referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil will be a pivotal point in sudenese talks middleton from chatham house said it was in the interest of the au to observe developments .
but how much the body needed to be involved would depend not so much on the actual agreements that are reached , but on the " feeling " between the two sides .
" i think if agreements are reached in an openness and generousness between north and south , that makes for a much more positive relationship going forward , " middleton said .
" if agreements are done grudgingly , the international community is going to want to be there to put more pressure on the two states to avoid situations which might revert to war . "
transparency will be crucial elections held in sudan in april of this year were viewed as a test run for the upcoming referendum .
the carter center , founded by former us president jimmy carter , monitored the process .
it concluded that the vote - which declared president al-bashir the winner - was " chaotic , non-transparent and vulnerable to electoral manipulation . "
should such lack of transparency also be observed at the january referendum , it could have disastrous consequences for the country , said alfred lokuji , an expert of the peace process based in southern sudan . "
northern sudan can ignore a vote for secession and claim that it was all rigged and if it 's a vote for unity , southern sudan can say it was all rigged , " lokuji told deutsche welle .
" whatever you do , you run into risks unless it 's well organized and as transparent as it possibly can be made . "
discussions are ' a good sign ' the current talks between the ncp and splm are a first step .
middleton said he was " cautiously optimistic " on progress .
" the fact that they 're talking is a good sign , " he said .
" of course , it 's much later than would have been ideal .
it would have been great if they 'd started these conversations a year ago rather than with months until the referendum .
but at least they 're doing it . "
and it appears they will not be marred by an arrest warrant against president al-bashir .
the international criminal court in the hague issued a second warrant this week on charges of genocide .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 16.07.2010 german national team captaincy drama rivets readers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's pre-world cup injury made lahm interim captain now that the world cup is over , the soap opera can begin .
dw fans wrote in to side with michael ballack or philipp lahm in the discussion on who should captain the nationalelf . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rights activists have sharply criticized the bill , which they say could be abused . the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , has approved a bill empowering the country 's secret police , the fsb , to call citizens in for " precautionary talks " for potential crimes agents believe may be committed in the future . under the law , fsb officials would require no evidence to take such action , which proponents of the new powers have said would be intended to prevent the possibility of a later criminal act " against the country 's security . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev spearheaded the fsb initiative the bill had been proposed by president dmitry medvedev and passed the 450-seat lower house of parliament with 354 votes .
most of the supporters were from the ruling united russia party . the country 's upper house , the federation council , must approve the bill before it can be sent to medvedev , whose signature would turn it into law . return of kgb ? but in an open letter to the council , democracy and rights groups have denounced the bill , saying it would herald in a return to conditions under the kgb , the soviet-era predecessor to the fsb . critics have said the powers could be used to intimidate government opponents and suppress protests .

he said there has not been a particular reason or event that necessitates giving extra powers to the security services . " nobody can mention a particular event , because a change in atmosphere is not an event , " kovalyov said .
" but we all feel it .
and -lsb- the bill 's initiators -rsb- are without any doubt the people who are in power , for no-one else can initiate such measures .
they also feel this change in atmosphere . " medvedev , meanwhile , defended the bill .
when questions were raised about the bill during a press conference with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday in yekaterinburg , medvedev , reluctant at first to address the subject , said it was perfectly normal for a country to update security policy . " every country has the right to improve its laws , including those on the security services , and we will do that , " medvedev said .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .

dw fans wrote in to side with michael ballack or philipp lahm in the discussion on who should captain the nationalelf . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "
the state premier of bavaria , of which munich is the capital , promptly rebuffed bogner 's negative stance in a news conference after the meeting , demanding a " first-class bid " instead .
squabbling and protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants a " first-class bid " for munich premier horst seehofer is keen to end squabbling between bogner , the state of bavaria , munich and the ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen , which is crucial to the bid because of its snowy alps .
" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .
locals in garmisch-partenkirchen and munich are concerned about the damage the olympics could do to the environment as well as the attitude of bogner and his team .
" mr. bogner and his bid committee are unbelievably patronizing to residents .
they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .
at some point the situation will just erupt , ” said alex doering , who is involved in the anti-olympic initiative nolympia 2018 .
a referendum held two weeks ago in oberammergau , about 10 kilometers north of garmisch-partenkirchen , already toppled plans for the town to host the biathlon and cross-country races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen is crucial to munich 's bid soccer support on the bright side , german bundesliga football champions bayern munich have thrown their support behind munich 's bid .
the team 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge has criticized opponents to the bid , saying he is irritated by the " obstructionists , " as he calls them .
since the beginning of the week , a petition against the bid has been circulating in garmisch-partenkirchen , but the organizers of the bid are confident that farmers in the area will permit the use of their land .
" the most important thing is that we speak their language , so they do n't have the feeling they are signing something under pressure , " joachim faerber , spokesman for munich 2018 , said after thursday 's meeting .
" -lsb- seehofer -rsb- and the lord mayor of munich were all confident after today 's meeting that the clouds are gone and the sun 's coming through , " he added .

" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .
locals in garmisch-partenkirchen and munich are concerned about the damage the olympics could do to the environment as well as the attitude of bogner and his team .
" mr. bogner and his bid committee are unbelievably patronizing to residents .
they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .
at some point the situation will just erupt , ” said alex doering , who is involved in the anti-olympic initiative nolympia 2018 .
a referendum held two weeks ago in oberammergau , about 10 kilometers north of garmisch-partenkirchen , already toppled plans for the town to host the biathlon and cross-country races .

since the beginning of the week , a petition against the bid has been circulating in garmisch-partenkirchen , but the organizers of the bid are confident that farmers in the area will permit the use of their land .

but critics have pointed the finger at misfiring plans to float the company on the stock market . travelling on germany 's high-speed ice trains has often been a harrowing experience recently .
horror stories circulated in the german media throughout the week , following an incident saturday when the air-conditioning broke down in a train travelling from berlin .
temperatures reached 50 degrees celsius -lrb- 122 degrees f -rrb- inside the train , and several people were hospitalized in the western german town of bielefeld . " a conductor came into our compartment with a doctor because a young boy was lying on the floor numb , " one anonymous passenger told reporters .
" his mother was really worried .
then she tried to smash a window , but thank god someone stopped her .
it was like in a disaster movie . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grube has just sanctioned a hugely expensive foreign takeover after initial claims that the air-conditioning breakdowns had only affected three trains on that day , reports have since emerged that germany 's current heat wave has disabled the air conditioning on as many as 50 trains this week . finally coming clean as a result deutsche bahn has been forced to admit that the cooling systems installed in some high-speed trains are simply not equipped to cope with the current heat .
when outside temperatures breach 32 degrees celsius , the systems on ice 2 trains routinely fail to keep the interior cool .
deutsche bahn chief ruediger grube was quick to apologize for the mess , but pointed the finger at climate change . " we have of course analyzed the weather situation in connection with the air conditioning system , " he said .
" and we found that in the last 20 years , only five days were hotter than 37 degrees .
three of those days happened last weekend . " deutsche bahn 's argument is that air conditioning standards - last set in the early 1990s - simply do not predict the kind of weather that has scorched much of europe in the last two weeks .
the company quickly added that the newer ice trains already had an air conditioning system that could cope with 35-degree heat , and that the next generation of ice 's - planned to start running next year - would take up to 40 degrees . cutting corners to boost stock market value bildunterschrift : dozens of people needed medical attention at bielefeld railway station but winfried wolf , a transport industry expert and long-time critic of deutsche bahn , said he believes the problem is part of an endemic drive to cut maintenance corners . " you know it 's going to be warmer than 32 degrees in the summer , " he said .
" and if you then do things like invest over a 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- in a general overhaul but leave the air conditioning systems in , then that is simply irresponsible .
this morning grube just said they are considering putting in new systems . " wolf said he believes the maintenance problem is a direct result of the failed plan to float the company on the stock market .
this idea has been mooted for many years , and has led to expensive foreign investments to boost the image of the company . " a week ago , grube made the decision a week ago to buy european bus and rail operator arriva , " wolf said , " for nearly 3 billion euros and not to invest this money in the improvement of the domestic rail service . " according to the coalition contract the german government made last october , deutsche bahn is still intended for the stock market , as soon as market conditions improve .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.07.2010 sudan 's path to referendum fraught with obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan is currently united under one flag .
but for how long ?
north and south sudanese leaders have begun talks on a strategy for a peaceful transition should a 2011 referendum result in the south gaining its independence .
but experts say time is running out to clarify all points . in six months time , sudan will vote in an historic referendum on whether the war-scarred south will gain independence .
but leaders from the north and south have a substantial number of details to clarify before the january 2011 vote .
" there 's a huge area to cover , but politicians on both sides realize that whatever happens at the referendum , they 're going to have to work out how the relationship is going to be framed in the future , " said roger middleton , a researcher in the african program of london-based think tank chatham house .
talks to continue talks between president omar al-bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- and the former southern rebel sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- kicked off in khartoum last weekend and were due to continue on july 19 .
the negotiations are focusing on how to ensure a peaceful transition after the referendum , in which the south is expected to vote in favor of self-rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omar al-bashir voted in the election , which observers called ' chaotic ' the referendum is part of the comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- , signed in january 2005 between the ncp and splm , which ended decades of civil war in sudan .
according to middleton , the parties are aware of the difficult task they face .
" they know the costs of going back to war are huge - for both sides , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's a huge codependency they have on peace . "
but elke grawert , a political scientist and sudan expert at the university of bremen , said it was unlikely that all points of discussion will be fully clarified in time .
" i think they will make some progress in resolving the issues , but it is imperative that the parties aim for a post-referendum process in which further negotiations take place , " grawert told deutsche welle .
oil is the crux four key issues are on the agenda for the talks over the next months : sharing oil resources , citizenship , security and respect of international agreements .
but observers agree that the pivotal point will be oil , as it plays a major role in sudan 's economy .
in addition to the referendum on southern independence , the oil-rich abyei region will also vote in january on which side to join .
according to the international monetary fund , oil now accounts for about 95 percent of sudan 's exports and over half of all government revenue .
most oil reserves are located in southern sudan , but the region is totally dependent on northern pipelines to funnel its crude to the red sea .
an agreement to share oil revenues was a key aspect of the cpa .
however , how these revenues should be split in the future poses a particular challenge after the referendum , said amy barry from the non-governmental organization global witness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the peace accord was signed in 2005 , many sudanese rejoiced .
" it 's a real catch-22 situation , " barry said .
" if the south , which is landlocked , decides on independence at the referendum , which it is expected to do , it will be almost entirely dependent on the north in order to export its oil .
so how are they going to ensure a fair and transparent oil deal post-january 2011 ? "
in an interview with deutsche welle , barry said preparations for a new deal have been " very inadequate . "
but more transparency was necessary in order to enable peace to last in a post-referendum situation .
grawert agreed that the handling of the oil resources required precise contracts .
" the course needs to be set for economic and political cooperation between both parts of the country , as they already now are economically linked , " said grawert , who heads the international research project " governance and social action in sudan after the peace agreement of january 2005 " with partners from universities in sudan , ethiopia and kenya .
the cpa expires six months after the referendum .
all interim agreements will run out at that time .
international pressure there are other key issues that need to be dealt with .
grawert pointed out that the future border between north and south left many questions open .
" what does that mean for nomadic tribes that are used to wandering between northern and southern sudan , in particular cattle breeders ? " she said .
" and what about citizenship issues ? "
overall , sudan is " alarmingly unprepared " for the critical referendum , according to a report by a global coalition of 26 humanitarian and human rights organizations published this week .
inadequate preparation was harming the chance of a credible vote on january 9 , 2011 .
role of the african union " the clock is ticking fast towards what might be the most important date in modern sudanese history , " the report " renewing the pledge : re-engaging the guarantors to the sudanese comprehensive peace agreement " said .
the cpa 's guarantors include the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , european union , united nations and the united states .
barry from global witness , which is part of this global coalition , said african leaders in particular had a key role to play in ensuring transparency .
the au will be holding its annual summit in uganda beginning monday .
" it 's a political signal that could be very usefully sent from the african summit in uganda , " barry said .
" the joint coalition report calls for them to reaffirm their support for the right of the southern sudanese to self-determination .
they should pledge to recognize the outcome of a free and fair referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil will be a pivotal point in sudenese talks middleton from chatham house said it was in the interest of the au to observe developments .
but how much the body needed to be involved would depend not so much on the actual agreements that are reached , but on the " feeling " between the two sides .
" i think if agreements are reached in an openness and generousness between north and south , that makes for a much more positive relationship going forward , " middleton said .
" if agreements are done grudgingly , the international community is going to want to be there to put more pressure on the two states to avoid situations which might revert to war . "
transparency will be crucial elections held in sudan in april of this year were viewed as a test run for the upcoming referendum .
the carter center , founded by former us president jimmy carter , monitored the process .
it concluded that the vote - which declared president al-bashir the winner - was " chaotic , non-transparent and vulnerable to electoral manipulation . "
should such lack of transparency also be observed at the january referendum , it could have disastrous consequences for the country , said alfred lokuji , an expert of the peace process based in southern sudan . "
northern sudan can ignore a vote for secession and claim that it was all rigged and if it 's a vote for unity , southern sudan can say it was all rigged , " lokuji told deutsche welle .
" whatever you do , you run into risks unless it 's well organized and as transparent as it possibly can be made . "
discussions are ' a good sign ' the current talks between the ncp and splm are a first step .
middleton said he was " cautiously optimistic " on progress .
" the fact that they 're talking is a good sign , " he said .
" of course , it 's much later than would have been ideal .
it would have been great if they 'd started these conversations a year ago rather than with months until the referendum .
but at least they 're doing it . "
and it appears they will not be marred by an arrest warrant against president al-bashir .
the international criminal court in the hague issued a second warrant this week on charges of genocide .

at least until the city 's busybodies get involved . i do n't own a car .
not for any high-principled carbon-footprint-reducing reasons , but simply because i dislike traffic and feel life is too short to have to run the gauntlet with a dozen other drivers looking for a parking space at the end of every day . when people regale me , as they do in these weeks of extreme heat , with their nightmare tales of trying to get in and out of the city on roads so packed that it takes an hour to travel just a couple of kilometers , i think fondly of my two-wheeler . i do n't do tight shorts or day-glo , have no trouser clips and i do n't - although i probably should - wear a helmet .
but for all that , i 'm a cyclist .
i peddle about town on a no frills bone-shaker , which barring the occasional morning when someone has nicked the valves or stuck a knife into my tire , is about as trusty a means of transport as ever there was . and berlin is not a bad place to get around by fahrrad -lrb- bike -rrb- .
okay , so the cycle path network is a bit arbitrary , and it takes a while to get used to the abuse issued from the mouths of self-important drivers , but on the whole the city feels good from atop a saddle . all the old cliches about wind in the hair and freedom of movement hold true , and there 's something particularly poetic about keeping pace with road-ragers stuck in stop-and-go traffic .
oh , the joy of gliding on by .
and on and on and on … because the unspoken rule of biking in berlin is very much " stop for no one and ignore the traffic lights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even berlin has traffic-free places to ride everyone rides on the pavement especially when it means dodging red lights .
and although both the police and the ordnungsbeamter -lrb- public order officials -rrb- have the power to sting offenders with an on-the-spot fine , they are so outnumbered these days that they rarely seem to bother . plastic bag man not so the city 's vigilantes .
a few months ago i was biking over a quiet bridge - on a cycle path , i hasten to add - when a man with a plastic carrier bag determinedly stepped out in front of me .
he held his hand in the air and told me in no uncertain terms that i was riding on wrong cycle path .
mine , he said , was on the other side of the road . i did what i always do in such situations and pretended not to understand him .
once he clocked that i was foreign , he pointed to the rail tracks below the bridge and spluttered the words " up , down , up down , suicide . " exactly what his floundering foray into english was meant to tell me , i will never know for sure , but i assumed he was warning me that i might end up beneath a train if by persisting in cycling against the flow , i suddenly no longer found myself " up , " but " down . "
i blew him a kiss and went on my way . i cross that bridge several times a week , and although for the most part , i still cycle on the " wrong " path , i do sometimes check to make sure plastic bag man is nowhere in sight .
he never is . if i were to meet him this summer , i doubt my crime would even stand out among the innumerable near misses between wobbling tourist cyclists and hardened berlin bikers .
the latter , it seems are not entirely happy about having to share their turf with hundreds of newcomers , who even i am willing to admit , are a bit of a liability . keeping it real still , that 's no excuse for what i witnessed last weekend when i tried to escape the heat myself by taking a train to the wandlitzsee lake .
i got on behind a man in a wheelchair and took a seat in a spacious compartment which quickly filled with both locals and tourists .
it was a bit of muddle , but it was okay until an unmistakable berliner climbed aboard and started ordering everyone else to stand up and leave so as to make space for his bike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes passersby like to help enforce the rules " you 're not the only ones on this train , " he carped . he was then joined by an equally grouchy conductor who ushered everyone out of the bike carriage .
everyone , that is , except the man in the wheelchair , who , as his wife politely explained , was not in much of a position to oblige .
rather than demonstrate any remorse for his evident faux-pas , the conductor insisted that the compartment , complete with 20 or so foldaway seats , was reserved for bicycles only .
the disabled man would have to find somewhere else to park his two wheels . that , i thought , is taking cycling too seriously .
and just for a moment , i considered joining the other side and getting myself a car . author : tamsin walker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not for any high-principled carbon-footprint-reducing reasons , but simply because i dislike traffic and feel life is too short to have to run the gauntlet with a dozen other drivers looking for a parking space at the end of every day . when people regale me , as they do in these weeks of extreme heat , with their nightmare tales of trying to get in and out of the city on roads so packed that it takes an hour to travel just a couple of kilometers , i think fondly of my two-wheeler . i do n't do tight shorts or day-glo , have no trouser clips and i do n't - although i probably should - wear a helmet .
but for all that , i 'm a cyclist .
i peddle about town on a no frills bone-shaker , which barring the occasional morning when someone has nicked the valves or stuck a knife into my tire , is about as trusty a means of transport as ever there was . and berlin is not a bad place to get around by fahrrad -lrb- bike -rrb- .
okay , so the cycle path network is a bit arbitrary , and it takes a while to get used to the abuse issued from the mouths of self-important drivers , but on the whole the city feels good from atop a saddle . all the old cliches about wind in the hair and freedom of movement hold true , and there 's something particularly poetic about keeping pace with road-ragers stuck in stop-and-go traffic .
oh , the joy of gliding on by .
and on and on and on … because the unspoken rule of biking in berlin is very much " stop for no one and ignore the traffic lights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even berlin has traffic-free places to ride everyone rides on the pavement especially when it means dodging red lights .
and although both the police and the ordnungsbeamter -lrb- public order officials -rrb- have the power to sting offenders with an on-the-spot fine , they are so outnumbered these days that they rarely seem to bother . plastic bag man not so the city 's vigilantes .
a few months ago i was biking over a quiet bridge - on a cycle path , i hasten to add - when a man with a plastic carrier bag determinedly stepped out in front of me .
he held his hand in the air and told me in no uncertain terms that i was riding on wrong cycle path .
mine , he said , was on the other side of the road . i did what i always do in such situations and pretended not to understand him .
once he clocked that i was foreign , he pointed to the rail tracks below the bridge and spluttered the words " up , down , up down , suicide . " exactly what his floundering foray into english was meant to tell me , i will never know for sure , but i assumed he was warning me that i might end up beneath a train if by persisting in cycling against the flow , i suddenly no longer found myself " up , " but " down . "
i blew him a kiss and went on my way . i cross that bridge several times a week , and although for the most part , i still cycle on the " wrong " path , i do sometimes check to make sure plastic bag man is nowhere in sight .
he never is . if i were to meet him this summer , i doubt my crime would even stand out among the innumerable near misses between wobbling tourist cyclists and hardened berlin bikers .
the latter , it seems are not entirely happy about having to share their turf with hundreds of newcomers , who even i am willing to admit , are a bit of a liability . keeping it real still , that 's no excuse for what i witnessed last weekend when i tried to escape the heat myself by taking a train to the wandlitzsee lake .
i got on behind a man in a wheelchair and took a seat in a spacious compartment which quickly filled with both locals and tourists .
it was a bit of muddle , but it was okay until an unmistakable berliner climbed aboard and started ordering everyone else to stand up and leave so as to make space for his bike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes passersby like to help enforce the rules " you 're not the only ones on this train , " he carped . he was then joined by an equally grouchy conductor who ushered everyone out of the bike carriage .
everyone , that is , except the man in the wheelchair , who , as his wife politely explained , was not in much of a position to oblige .
rather than demonstrate any remorse for his evident faux-pas , the conductor insisted that the compartment , complete with 20 or so foldaway seats , was reserved for bicycles only .
the disabled man would have to find somewhere else to park his two wheels . that , i thought , is taking cycling too seriously .
and just for a moment , i considered joining the other side and getting myself a car . author : tamsin walker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

at least until the city 's busybodies get involved . i do n't own a car .
not for any high-principled carbon-footprint-reducing reasons , but simply because i dislike traffic and feel life is too short to have to run the gauntlet with a dozen other drivers looking for a parking space at the end of every day . when people regale me , as they do in these weeks of extreme heat , with their nightmare tales of trying to get in and out of the city on roads so packed that it takes an hour to travel just a couple of kilometers , i think fondly of my two-wheeler . i do n't do tight shorts or day-glo , have no trouser clips and i do n't - although i probably should - wear a helmet .
but for all that , i 'm a cyclist .
i peddle about town on a no frills bone-shaker , which barring the occasional morning when someone has nicked the valves or stuck a knife into my tire , is about as trusty a means of transport as ever there was . and berlin is not a bad place to get around by fahrrad -lrb- bike -rrb- .
okay , so the cycle path network is a bit arbitrary , and it takes a while to get used to the abuse issued from the mouths of self-important drivers , but on the whole the city feels good from atop a saddle . all the old cliches about wind in the hair and freedom of movement hold true , and there 's something particularly poetic about keeping pace with road-ragers stuck in stop-and-go traffic .
oh , the joy of gliding on by .
and on and on and on … because the unspoken rule of biking in berlin is very much " stop for no one and ignore the traffic lights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even berlin has traffic-free places to ride everyone rides on the pavement especially when it means dodging red lights .
and although both the police and the ordnungsbeamter -lrb- public order officials -rrb- have the power to sting offenders with an on-the-spot fine , they are so outnumbered these days that they rarely seem to bother . plastic bag man not so the city 's vigilantes .
a few months ago i was biking over a quiet bridge - on a cycle path , i hasten to add - when a man with a plastic carrier bag determinedly stepped out in front of me .
he held his hand in the air and told me in no uncertain terms that i was riding on wrong cycle path .
mine , he said , was on the other side of the road . i did what i always do in such situations and pretended not to understand him .
once he clocked that i was foreign , he pointed to the rail tracks below the bridge and spluttered the words " up , down , up down , suicide . " exactly what his floundering foray into english was meant to tell me , i will never know for sure , but i assumed he was warning me that i might end up beneath a train if by persisting in cycling against the flow , i suddenly no longer found myself " up , " but " down . "
i blew him a kiss and went on my way . i cross that bridge several times a week , and although for the most part , i still cycle on the " wrong " path , i do sometimes check to make sure plastic bag man is nowhere in sight .
he never is . if i were to meet him this summer , i doubt my crime would even stand out among the innumerable near misses between wobbling tourist cyclists and hardened berlin bikers .
the latter , it seems are not entirely happy about having to share their turf with hundreds of newcomers , who even i am willing to admit , are a bit of a liability . keeping it real still , that 's no excuse for what i witnessed last weekend when i tried to escape the heat myself by taking a train to the wandlitzsee lake .

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "
the state premier of bavaria , of which munich is the capital , promptly rebuffed bogner 's negative stance in a news conference after the meeting , demanding a " first-class bid " instead .
squabbling and protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants a " first-class bid " for munich premier horst seehofer is keen to end squabbling between bogner , the state of bavaria , munich and the ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen , which is crucial to the bid because of its snowy alps .
" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .
locals in garmisch-partenkirchen and munich are concerned about the damage the olympics could do to the environment as well as the attitude of bogner and his team .
" mr. bogner and his bid committee are unbelievably patronizing to residents .
they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .
at some point the situation will just erupt , ” said alex doering , who is involved in the anti-olympic initiative nolympia 2018 .
a referendum held two weeks ago in oberammergau , about 10 kilometers north of garmisch-partenkirchen , already toppled plans for the town to host the biathlon and cross-country races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen is crucial to munich 's bid soccer support on the bright side , german bundesliga football champions bayern munich have thrown their support behind munich 's bid .
the team 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge has criticized opponents to the bid , saying he is irritated by the " obstructionists , " as he calls them .
since the beginning of the week , a petition against the bid has been circulating in garmisch-partenkirchen , but the organizers of the bid are confident that farmers in the area will permit the use of their land .
" the most important thing is that we speak their language , so they do n't have the feeling they are signing something under pressure , " joachim faerber , spokesman for munich 2018 , said after thursday 's meeting .

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "
the state premier of bavaria , of which munich is the capital , promptly rebuffed bogner 's negative stance in a news conference after the meeting , demanding a " first-class bid " instead .
squabbling and protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants a " first-class bid " for munich premier horst seehofer is keen to end squabbling between bogner , the state of bavaria , munich and the ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen , which is crucial to the bid because of its snowy alps .
" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .
locals in garmisch-partenkirchen and munich are concerned about the damage the olympics could do to the environment as well as the attitude of bogner and his team .
" mr. bogner and his bid committee are unbelievably patronizing to residents .
they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .
at some point the situation will just erupt , ” said alex doering , who is involved in the anti-olympic initiative nolympia 2018 .
a referendum held two weeks ago in oberammergau , about 10 kilometers north of garmisch-partenkirchen , already toppled plans for the town to host the biathlon and cross-country races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen is crucial to munich 's bid soccer support on the bright side , german bundesliga football champions bayern munich have thrown their support behind munich 's bid .
the team 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge has criticized opponents to the bid , saying he is irritated by the " obstructionists , " as he calls them .
since the beginning of the week , a petition against the bid has been circulating in garmisch-partenkirchen , but the organizers of the bid are confident that farmers in the area will permit the use of their land .
" the most important thing is that we speak their language , so they do n't have the feeling they are signing something under pressure , " joachim faerber , spokesman for munich 2018 , said after thursday 's meeting .
" -lsb- seehofer -rsb- and the lord mayor of munich were all confident after today 's meeting that the clouds are gone and the sun 's coming through , " he added .

at least until the city 's busybodies get involved . i do n't own a car .
not for any high-principled carbon-footprint-reducing reasons , but simply because i dislike traffic and feel life is too short to have to run the gauntlet with a dozen other drivers looking for a parking space at the end of every day . when people regale me , as they do in these weeks of extreme heat , with their nightmare tales of trying to get in and out of the city on roads so packed that it takes an hour to travel just a couple of kilometers , i think fondly of my two-wheeler . i do n't do tight shorts or day-glo , have no trouser clips and i do n't - although i probably should - wear a helmet .
but for all that , i 'm a cyclist .
i peddle about town on a no frills bone-shaker , which barring the occasional morning when someone has nicked the valves or stuck a knife into my tire , is about as trusty a means of transport as ever there was . and berlin is not a bad place to get around by fahrrad -lrb- bike -rrb- .
okay , so the cycle path network is a bit arbitrary , and it takes a while to get used to the abuse issued from the mouths of self-important drivers , but on the whole the city feels good from atop a saddle . all the old cliches about wind in the hair and freedom of movement hold true , and there 's something particularly poetic about keeping pace with road-ragers stuck in stop-and-go traffic .
oh , the joy of gliding on by .
and on and on and on … because the unspoken rule of biking in berlin is very much " stop for no one and ignore the traffic lights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even berlin has traffic-free places to ride everyone rides on the pavement especially when it means dodging red lights .

at least until the city 's busybodies get involved . i do n't own a car .
not for any high-principled carbon-footprint-reducing reasons , but simply because i dislike traffic and feel life is too short to have to run the gauntlet with a dozen other drivers looking for a parking space at the end of every day . when people regale me , as they do in these weeks of extreme heat , with their nightmare tales of trying to get in and out of the city on roads so packed that it takes an hour to travel just a couple of kilometers , i think fondly of my two-wheeler . i do n't do tight shorts or day-glo , have no trouser clips and i do n't - although i probably should - wear a helmet .
but for all that , i 'm a cyclist .
i peddle about town on a no frills bone-shaker , which barring the occasional morning when someone has nicked the valves or stuck a knife into my tire , is about as trusty a means of transport as ever there was . and berlin is not a bad place to get around by fahrrad -lrb- bike -rrb- .
okay , so the cycle path network is a bit arbitrary , and it takes a while to get used to the abuse issued from the mouths of self-important drivers , but on the whole the city feels good from atop a saddle . all the old cliches about wind in the hair and freedom of movement hold true , and there 's something particularly poetic about keeping pace with road-ragers stuck in stop-and-go traffic .
oh , the joy of gliding on by .
and on and on and on … because the unspoken rule of biking in berlin is very much " stop for no one and ignore the traffic lights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even berlin has traffic-free places to ride everyone rides on the pavement especially when it means dodging red lights .
and although both the police and the ordnungsbeamter -lrb- public order officials -rrb- have the power to sting offenders with an on-the-spot fine , they are so outnumbered these days that they rarely seem to bother . plastic bag man not so the city 's vigilantes .

karl-theodor zu guttenberg was on the second day of a surprise visit to the war-torn country . it was a last minute cancelation .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was on his way to visit the german camp of quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- troops in baghlan , when the news of the clashes between the troops and the taliban came .

his helicopter turned back immediately . " security takes precedence , also for the men there , " guttenberg said . earlier guttenberg paid a visit to the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-e-sharif .
there he took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the machines are supposed to give logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
after that , the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants . bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers escalating insurgency in kunduz , guttenberg also witnessed a demonstration of how armored howitzers that were recently made available to german troops can be used against insurgents . over the past weeks , the taliban have stepped up attacks against international troops .
in june , 102 isaf soldiers were killed in the war-torn country , making it the deadliest month so far for the alliance in the course of the nine-year old war . seven german soldiers also died in april in fighting in the northern provinces of kunduz and baghlan .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.07.2010 sudan 's path to referendum fraught with obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan is currently united under one flag .
but for how long ?
north and south sudanese leaders have begun talks on a strategy for a peaceful transition should a 2011 referendum result in the south gaining its independence .
but experts say time is running out to clarify all points . in six months time , sudan will vote in an historic referendum on whether the war-scarred south will gain independence .
but leaders from the north and south have a substantial number of details to clarify before the january 2011 vote .
" there 's a huge area to cover , but politicians on both sides realize that whatever happens at the referendum , they 're going to have to work out how the relationship is going to be framed in the future , " said roger middleton , a researcher in the african program of london-based think tank chatham house .
talks to continue talks between president omar al-bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- and the former southern rebel sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- kicked off in khartoum last weekend and were due to continue on july 19 .
the negotiations are focusing on how to ensure a peaceful transition after the referendum , in which the south is expected to vote in favor of self-rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omar al-bashir voted in the election , which observers called ' chaotic ' the referendum is part of the comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- , signed in january 2005 between the ncp and splm , which ended decades of civil war in sudan .
according to middleton , the parties are aware of the difficult task they face .
" they know the costs of going back to war are huge - for both sides , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's a huge codependency they have on peace . "
but elke grawert , a political scientist and sudan expert at the university of bremen , said it was unlikely that all points of discussion will be fully clarified in time .
" i think they will make some progress in resolving the issues , but it is imperative that the parties aim for a post-referendum process in which further negotiations take place , " grawert told deutsche welle .
oil is the crux four key issues are on the agenda for the talks over the next months : sharing oil resources , citizenship , security and respect of international agreements .
but observers agree that the pivotal point will be oil , as it plays a major role in sudan 's economy .
in addition to the referendum on southern independence , the oil-rich abyei region will also vote in january on which side to join .
according to the international monetary fund , oil now accounts for about 95 percent of sudan 's exports and over half of all government revenue .
most oil reserves are located in southern sudan , but the region is totally dependent on northern pipelines to funnel its crude to the red sea .
an agreement to share oil revenues was a key aspect of the cpa .
however , how these revenues should be split in the future poses a particular challenge after the referendum , said amy barry from the non-governmental organization global witness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the peace accord was signed in 2005 , many sudanese rejoiced .
" it 's a real catch-22 situation , " barry said .
" if the south , which is landlocked , decides on independence at the referendum , which it is expected to do , it will be almost entirely dependent on the north in order to export its oil .
so how are they going to ensure a fair and transparent oil deal post-january 2011 ? "
in an interview with deutsche welle , barry said preparations for a new deal have been " very inadequate . "
but more transparency was necessary in order to enable peace to last in a post-referendum situation .
grawert agreed that the handling of the oil resources required precise contracts .
" the course needs to be set for economic and political cooperation between both parts of the country , as they already now are economically linked , " said grawert , who heads the international research project " governance and social action in sudan after the peace agreement of january 2005 " with partners from universities in sudan , ethiopia and kenya .
the cpa expires six months after the referendum .
all interim agreements will run out at that time .
international pressure there are other key issues that need to be dealt with .
grawert pointed out that the future border between north and south left many questions open .
" what does that mean for nomadic tribes that are used to wandering between northern and southern sudan , in particular cattle breeders ? " she said .
" and what about citizenship issues ? "
overall , sudan is " alarmingly unprepared " for the critical referendum , according to a report by a global coalition of 26 humanitarian and human rights organizations published this week .
inadequate preparation was harming the chance of a credible vote on january 9 , 2011 .
role of the african union " the clock is ticking fast towards what might be the most important date in modern sudanese history , " the report " renewing the pledge : re-engaging the guarantors to the sudanese comprehensive peace agreement " said .
the cpa 's guarantors include the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , european union , united nations and the united states .
barry from global witness , which is part of this global coalition , said african leaders in particular had a key role to play in ensuring transparency .
the au will be holding its annual summit in uganda beginning monday .
" it 's a political signal that could be very usefully sent from the african summit in uganda , " barry said .
" the joint coalition report calls for them to reaffirm their support for the right of the southern sudanese to self-determination .
they should pledge to recognize the outcome of a free and fair referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil will be a pivotal point in sudenese talks middleton from chatham house said it was in the interest of the au to observe developments .
but how much the body needed to be involved would depend not so much on the actual agreements that are reached , but on the " feeling " between the two sides .
" i think if agreements are reached in an openness and generousness between north and south , that makes for a much more positive relationship going forward , " middleton said .
" if agreements are done grudgingly , the international community is going to want to be there to put more pressure on the two states to avoid situations which might revert to war . "
transparency will be crucial elections held in sudan in april of this year were viewed as a test run for the upcoming referendum .
the carter center , founded by former us president jimmy carter , monitored the process .
it concluded that the vote - which declared president al-bashir the winner - was " chaotic , non-transparent and vulnerable to electoral manipulation . "
should such lack of transparency also be observed at the january referendum , it could have disastrous consequences for the country , said alfred lokuji , an expert of the peace process based in southern sudan . "
northern sudan can ignore a vote for secession and claim that it was all rigged and if it 's a vote for unity , southern sudan can say it was all rigged , " lokuji told deutsche welle .
" whatever you do , you run into risks unless it 's well organized and as transparent as it possibly can be made . "
discussions are ' a good sign ' the current talks between the ncp and splm are a first step .
middleton said he was " cautiously optimistic " on progress .
" the fact that they 're talking is a good sign , " he said .
" of course , it 's much later than would have been ideal .
it would have been great if they 'd started these conversations a year ago rather than with months until the referendum .
but at least they 're doing it . "
and it appears they will not be marred by an arrest warrant against president al-bashir .
the international criminal court in the hague issued a second warrant this week on charges of genocide .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 16.07.2010 germany loses export race but wins big customer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese consumers like kitchens " made in germany " after dethroning germany as the world 's top exporter , china is quietly becoming one of the country 's biggest customers for a wide range of products .
in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .
chief among them is the protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- .
during her meetings with chinese government officials , merkel again stressed the need to respect patents . ' in the lion 's den ' while admitting that china has taken steps to curb ipr violation in the country , beilke said " copying remains an issue . "
and he speaks from experience . " we 're affected by it , " beilke said .
" but we still have to be in the lion 's den .
the market is too big . " trade between the export powerhouses has grown steadily , to 91 billion dollars last year compared with $ 41 billion in 2001 .
of last year 's total , chinese exports to germany accounted for $ 55 billion and germany 's exports to china for $ 36 billion . author : john blau editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but for how long ?
north and south sudanese leaders have begun talks on a strategy for a peaceful transition should a 2011 referendum result in the south gaining its independence .
but experts say time is running out to clarify all points . in six months time , sudan will vote in an historic referendum on whether the war-scarred south will gain independence .
but leaders from the north and south have a substantial number of details to clarify before the january 2011 vote .
" there 's a huge area to cover , but politicians on both sides realize that whatever happens at the referendum , they 're going to have to work out how the relationship is going to be framed in the future , " said roger middleton , a researcher in the african program of london-based think tank chatham house .
talks to continue talks between president omar al-bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- and the former southern rebel sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- kicked off in khartoum last weekend and were due to continue on july 19 .
the negotiations are focusing on how to ensure a peaceful transition after the referendum , in which the south is expected to vote in favor of self-rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omar al-bashir voted in the election , which observers called ' chaotic ' the referendum is part of the comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- , signed in january 2005 between the ncp and splm , which ended decades of civil war in sudan .
according to middleton , the parties are aware of the difficult task they face .
" they know the costs of going back to war are huge - for both sides , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's a huge codependency they have on peace . "
but elke grawert , a political scientist and sudan expert at the university of bremen , said it was unlikely that all points of discussion will be fully clarified in time .
" i think they will make some progress in resolving the issues , but it is imperative that the parties aim for a post-referendum process in which further negotiations take place , " grawert told deutsche welle .
oil is the crux four key issues are on the agenda for the talks over the next months : sharing oil resources , citizenship , security and respect of international agreements .
but observers agree that the pivotal point will be oil , as it plays a major role in sudan 's economy .
in addition to the referendum on southern independence , the oil-rich abyei region will also vote in january on which side to join .
according to the international monetary fund , oil now accounts for about 95 percent of sudan 's exports and over half of all government revenue .
most oil reserves are located in southern sudan , but the region is totally dependent on northern pipelines to funnel its crude to the red sea .
an agreement to share oil revenues was a key aspect of the cpa .
however , how these revenues should be split in the future poses a particular challenge after the referendum , said amy barry from the non-governmental organization global witness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the peace accord was signed in 2005 , many sudanese rejoiced .
" it 's a real catch-22 situation , " barry said .
" if the south , which is landlocked , decides on independence at the referendum , which it is expected to do , it will be almost entirely dependent on the north in order to export its oil .
so how are they going to ensure a fair and transparent oil deal post-january 2011 ? "
in an interview with deutsche welle , barry said preparations for a new deal have been " very inadequate . "
but more transparency was necessary in order to enable peace to last in a post-referendum situation .
grawert agreed that the handling of the oil resources required precise contracts .
" the course needs to be set for economic and political cooperation between both parts of the country , as they already now are economically linked , " said grawert , who heads the international research project " governance and social action in sudan after the peace agreement of january 2005 " with partners from universities in sudan , ethiopia and kenya .
the cpa expires six months after the referendum .
all interim agreements will run out at that time .
international pressure there are other key issues that need to be dealt with .
grawert pointed out that the future border between north and south left many questions open .
" what does that mean for nomadic tribes that are used to wandering between northern and southern sudan , in particular cattle breeders ? " she said .
" and what about citizenship issues ? "
overall , sudan is " alarmingly unprepared " for the critical referendum , according to a report by a global coalition of 26 humanitarian and human rights organizations published this week .
inadequate preparation was harming the chance of a credible vote on january 9 , 2011 .
role of the african union " the clock is ticking fast towards what might be the most important date in modern sudanese history , " the report " renewing the pledge : re-engaging the guarantors to the sudanese comprehensive peace agreement " said .
the cpa 's guarantors include the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , european union , united nations and the united states .
barry from global witness , which is part of this global coalition , said african leaders in particular had a key role to play in ensuring transparency .
the au will be holding its annual summit in uganda beginning monday .
" it 's a political signal that could be very usefully sent from the african summit in uganda , " barry said .
" the joint coalition report calls for them to reaffirm their support for the right of the southern sudanese to self-determination .
they should pledge to recognize the outcome of a free and fair referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil will be a pivotal point in sudenese talks middleton from chatham house said it was in the interest of the au to observe developments .
but how much the body needed to be involved would depend not so much on the actual agreements that are reached , but on the " feeling " between the two sides .
" i think if agreements are reached in an openness and generousness between north and south , that makes for a much more positive relationship going forward , " middleton said .
" if agreements are done grudgingly , the international community is going to want to be there to put more pressure on the two states to avoid situations which might revert to war . "
transparency will be crucial elections held in sudan in april of this year were viewed as a test run for the upcoming referendum .
the carter center , founded by former us president jimmy carter , monitored the process .
it concluded that the vote - which declared president al-bashir the winner - was " chaotic , non-transparent and vulnerable to electoral manipulation . "
should such lack of transparency also be observed at the january referendum , it could have disastrous consequences for the country , said alfred lokuji , an expert of the peace process based in southern sudan . "
northern sudan can ignore a vote for secession and claim that it was all rigged and if it 's a vote for unity , southern sudan can say it was all rigged , " lokuji told deutsche welle .
" whatever you do , you run into risks unless it 's well organized and as transparent as it possibly can be made . "
discussions are ' a good sign ' the current talks between the ncp and splm are a first step .
middleton said he was " cautiously optimistic " on progress .
" the fact that they 're talking is a good sign , " he said .
" of course , it 's much later than would have been ideal .
it would have been great if they 'd started these conversations a year ago rather than with months until the referendum .
but at least they 're doing it . "
and it appears they will not be marred by an arrest warrant against president al-bashir .
the international criminal court in the hague issued a second warrant this week on charges of genocide .

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .
" we are convinced that the japanese , not only as consumers , but also as taxpayers and industrial partners , will be better off for it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 16.07.2010 bangladesh garment workers fight for higher wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a garment worker argues with policemen during a protest in dhaka in bangladesh , textile workers who produce clothes for western brands are fighting for an immediate pay rise .
violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .

" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 16.07.2010 germany loses export race but wins big customer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese consumers like kitchens " made in germany " after dethroning germany as the world 's top exporter , china is quietly becoming one of the country 's biggest customers for a wide range of products .
in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .

in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .
chief among them is the protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .

guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .

but for how long ?
north and south sudanese leaders have begun talks on a strategy for a peaceful transition should a 2011 referendum result in the south gaining its independence .
but experts say time is running out to clarify all points . in six months time , sudan will vote in an historic referendum on whether the war-scarred south will gain independence .
but leaders from the north and south have a substantial number of details to clarify before the january 2011 vote .
" there 's a huge area to cover , but politicians on both sides realize that whatever happens at the referendum , they 're going to have to work out how the relationship is going to be framed in the future , " said roger middleton , a researcher in the african program of london-based think tank chatham house .
talks to continue talks between president omar al-bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- and the former southern rebel sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- kicked off in khartoum last weekend and were due to continue on july 19 .
the negotiations are focusing on how to ensure a peaceful transition after the referendum , in which the south is expected to vote in favor of self-rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omar al-bashir voted in the election , which observers called ' chaotic ' the referendum is part of the comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- , signed in january 2005 between the ncp and splm , which ended decades of civil war in sudan .
according to middleton , the parties are aware of the difficult task they face .
" they know the costs of going back to war are huge - for both sides , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's a huge codependency they have on peace . "
but elke grawert , a political scientist and sudan expert at the university of bremen , said it was unlikely that all points of discussion will be fully clarified in time .
" i think they will make some progress in resolving the issues , but it is imperative that the parties aim for a post-referendum process in which further negotiations take place , " grawert told deutsche welle .
oil is the crux four key issues are on the agenda for the talks over the next months : sharing oil resources , citizenship , security and respect of international agreements .
but observers agree that the pivotal point will be oil , as it plays a major role in sudan 's economy .
in addition to the referendum on southern independence , the oil-rich abyei region will also vote in january on which side to join .
according to the international monetary fund , oil now accounts for about 95 percent of sudan 's exports and over half of all government revenue .
most oil reserves are located in southern sudan , but the region is totally dependent on northern pipelines to funnel its crude to the red sea .
an agreement to share oil revenues was a key aspect of the cpa .
however , how these revenues should be split in the future poses a particular challenge after the referendum , said amy barry from the non-governmental organization global witness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the peace accord was signed in 2005 , many sudanese rejoiced .
" it 's a real catch-22 situation , " barry said .
" if the south , which is landlocked , decides on independence at the referendum , which it is expected to do , it will be almost entirely dependent on the north in order to export its oil .
so how are they going to ensure a fair and transparent oil deal post-january 2011 ? "
in an interview with deutsche welle , barry said preparations for a new deal have been " very inadequate . "
but more transparency was necessary in order to enable peace to last in a post-referendum situation .
grawert agreed that the handling of the oil resources required precise contracts .
" the course needs to be set for economic and political cooperation between both parts of the country , as they already now are economically linked , " said grawert , who heads the international research project " governance and social action in sudan after the peace agreement of january 2005 " with partners from universities in sudan , ethiopia and kenya .
the cpa expires six months after the referendum .
all interim agreements will run out at that time .
international pressure there are other key issues that need to be dealt with .
grawert pointed out that the future border between north and south left many questions open .
" what does that mean for nomadic tribes that are used to wandering between northern and southern sudan , in particular cattle breeders ? " she said .
" and what about citizenship issues ? "
overall , sudan is " alarmingly unprepared " for the critical referendum , according to a report by a global coalition of 26 humanitarian and human rights organizations published this week .
inadequate preparation was harming the chance of a credible vote on january 9 , 2011 .
role of the african union " the clock is ticking fast towards what might be the most important date in modern sudanese history , " the report " renewing the pledge : re-engaging the guarantors to the sudanese comprehensive peace agreement " said .
the cpa 's guarantors include the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , european union , united nations and the united states .
barry from global witness , which is part of this global coalition , said african leaders in particular had a key role to play in ensuring transparency .
the au will be holding its annual summit in uganda beginning monday .
" it 's a political signal that could be very usefully sent from the african summit in uganda , " barry said .
" the joint coalition report calls for them to reaffirm their support for the right of the southern sudanese to self-determination .
they should pledge to recognize the outcome of a free and fair referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil will be a pivotal point in sudenese talks middleton from chatham house said it was in the interest of the au to observe developments .
but how much the body needed to be involved would depend not so much on the actual agreements that are reached , but on the " feeling " between the two sides .
" i think if agreements are reached in an openness and generousness between north and south , that makes for a much more positive relationship going forward , " middleton said .
" if agreements are done grudgingly , the international community is going to want to be there to put more pressure on the two states to avoid situations which might revert to war . "
transparency will be crucial elections held in sudan in april of this year were viewed as a test run for the upcoming referendum .
the carter center , founded by former us president jimmy carter , monitored the process .
it concluded that the vote - which declared president al-bashir the winner - was " chaotic , non-transparent and vulnerable to electoral manipulation . "
should such lack of transparency also be observed at the january referendum , it could have disastrous consequences for the country , said alfred lokuji , an expert of the peace process based in southern sudan . "
northern sudan can ignore a vote for secession and claim that it was all rigged and if it 's a vote for unity , southern sudan can say it was all rigged , " lokuji told deutsche welle .
" whatever you do , you run into risks unless it 's well organized and as transparent as it possibly can be made . "
discussions are ' a good sign ' the current talks between the ncp and splm are a first step .
middleton said he was " cautiously optimistic " on progress .
" the fact that they 're talking is a good sign , " he said .
" of course , it 's much later than would have been ideal .
it would have been great if they 'd started these conversations a year ago rather than with months until the referendum .
but at least they 're doing it . "
and it appears they will not be marred by an arrest warrant against president al-bashir .
the international criminal court in the hague issued a second warrant this week on charges of genocide .

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "
the state premier of bavaria , of which munich is the capital , promptly rebuffed bogner 's negative stance in a news conference after the meeting , demanding a " first-class bid " instead .

" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .

they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 16.07.2010 programs in bangladesh offer women the chance at a decent day 's work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in the eu-funded reopa cash-for-work program get their hands dirty the bangladesh constitution might promise gender equality , but discrimination is still widespread – especially in rural areas .
these are the areas eu-funded programs are targeting to try to lift women out of poverty . bangladesh has made some inroads in its attempt to achieve gender equality : dowry payments have been banned , primary school classrooms around the country are filled with as many little girls as boys , and the top government job is filled by a woman , prime minister sheikh hasina .
but the south-asian country still has a way to go .
the oecd social institutions and gender index puts it at number 90 out of a possible 102 non-oecd countries analyzed , making it one of the world 's most discriminatory countries towards women .
rape and acid attacks are still relatively common , and in the home , men still wield most of the decision-making and economic power – which leaves bangladesh 's women , especially its millions of divorced , abandoned or widowed women , in a precarious position .
the challenges these women face can be especially severe in the more conservative rural areas .
these are the places european union donors have been targeting with programs aimed at helping lift women out of poverty for good .
in a small village in sirajganj district , in the north-east of bangladesh , 40-year-old hasne is hard at work .
she and a handful of other women are doing maintenance on the dirt track that is this the village 's main thoroughfare .
they take turns carrying mud and clumps of earth up from the main road and stamping it down onto the dirt path .
it 's tough work and especially so on a day like today , in the middle of the hot season .
hasne cracks a grin and says that , compared to her last job , this is great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reopa employee hasne says she prefers roadwork to her old housework job when her husband died , hasne took up work as a maid to try to support her three children .
she worked long hours but received only meals and a monthly wage of just 200 to 300 taka , or around three euros , in return .
a way out of poverty for hasne , the turning point came when she was chosen to be part of a european union-funded work-for-cash program , the rural employment opportunities for public assets project , reopa .
the program employs vulnerable , poor women to do work that helps their communities , like fixing up the roads , and by bangladesh standards it pays a decent wage : about 23 euros a month .
so far the program has employed over 24000 bangladeshi women – most of them divorced , abandoned or widowed women who would otherwise have little social capital and few economic prospects .
now that she has a regular income , hasne says she receives more respect from the community and is in a better position to look after her children .
" the first thing i did was send my children to school , and i did some repairs on my house .
i can afford good food now .
and we installed a tube well so that we can have safe drinking water , " she said .
there are thousands of programs like this one , not just in bangladesh but across the developing world .
the catch is that women like hasne must leave the program after two years so that a new round of women can participate .
throughout their employment , the women save almost a third of their wages to be invested later in a business or in property .
" we mentally prepare them to become ready to take the fight on after the job , because the job is not for life , " said kajal chatterjee , reopa capacity strengthening advisor for this region .
" -lsb- we say : -rsb- you have to save some money , and you have to learn how to utilize this money on your own , and to survive .
so i think the main principle here is self-sustainability . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment and assets like cows help women today - and hopefully tomorrow , too reopa has just entered its second phase , and with 98 percent of participants continuing to earn over a euro a day after leaving the program , organizers are calling the first phase a success .
bangladesh 's island poor do it tough a similar program run in the river island region , the chars livelihood program , offers poor families an income-generating asset – typically a cow – rather than employment .
program leader malcolm marks said that the program seeks to assist the poorest inhabitants of the chars , or islands , rather than women in particular – although the poorest families are often female-headed households .
" over time -lsb- the women -rsb- have become … economically empowered , " he said .
" they 're actually earning a good income from their animals , and this in itself is also socially empowering .
bangladesh is a country that has a society that is very hierarchical .
the class system is very much in place . " giving women a status symbol object like a cow helps them earn a living , but it also gives them a leg up the social ladder , marks said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this little girl 's parents can feed her properly , in part because of their participation in the chars livelihoods program according to the most recent undp millennium goals progress report for bangladesh , wage employment for women in bangladesh is still low – one in eight – and , unlike other development indicators in the country , it 's on the way down .
purdah , or the segregation of men and women for cultural and religious reasons , is observed in various forms across the country but especially in conservative rural areas , where women are often expected to stay in the home and where many can not travel without a male relative accompanying them .
more than mere glass ceilings to contend with in the cities , where women often work outside the home , even women who make it to the top face a struggle .
bilkis nahar is a successful television news editor who works in the capital , dhaka .
she said that when she first became an editor , the male reporters working under her had trouble accepting their new boss because they were unaccustomed to women occupying senior positions . nahar was one of the first female news editors in the country .
" day after day i had to fight -lsb- to show -rsb- that i am capable of that position , and they accepted me after a long time .
but it 's not finished , " she said .
although the bangladeshi government has passed legislation to ban dowry payments and discourage parents from marrying off their young daughters , women 's advocacy groups have pointed to discriminatory inheritance laws as an area that must also be reformed if bangladeshi women are ever to experience a significant shift in status .
fundamental reforms may be needed for real change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv editor bilkis nahar says even though a woman , sheikh hasina , has bangladesh 's top job , ordinary women still face discrimination islamic law in the majority muslim nation dictates that a daughter inherit only half as much as her brothers , and women are unlikely to claim their share of family property unless it is offered to them .
" this situation is actually hampering the inner power of women to be empowered , " nahar said .
nahar says that programs in which women are given access to an income or assets fail to address more fundamental structures in bangladesh society that are halting progress in empowering women .
" a very small percentage of women is working at a decision-making level .
so it means that they 're not enjoying a lot of freedom in their workplaces , or in their home , in their school or others , because of -lsb- the -rsb- male-dominated society , and the mentality and social structure of that country , " she said .
but back in hasne 's village in sirajganj there are some promising signs that those shifts are already starting to take place .
men and children are crowding around the track hasne and the other women are working on .
one of the men , saiful islam , says he and the other villagers have more respect for the women now that they 're earning their own money .
as a matter of fact , the 38-year-old rickshaw-puller says , he would n't mind trading places with them .

these are the areas eu-funded programs are targeting to try to lift women out of poverty . bangladesh has made some inroads in its attempt to achieve gender equality : dowry payments have been banned , primary school classrooms around the country are filled with as many little girls as boys , and the top government job is filled by a woman , prime minister sheikh hasina .
but the south-asian country still has a way to go .
the oecd social institutions and gender index puts it at number 90 out of a possible 102 non-oecd countries analyzed , making it one of the world 's most discriminatory countries towards women .
rape and acid attacks are still relatively common , and in the home , men still wield most of the decision-making and economic power – which leaves bangladesh 's women , especially its millions of divorced , abandoned or widowed women , in a precarious position .
the challenges these women face can be especially severe in the more conservative rural areas .
these are the places european union donors have been targeting with programs aimed at helping lift women out of poverty for good .
in a small village in sirajganj district , in the north-east of bangladesh , 40-year-old hasne is hard at work .
she and a handful of other women are doing maintenance on the dirt track that is this the village 's main thoroughfare .
they take turns carrying mud and clumps of earth up from the main road and stamping it down onto the dirt path .
it 's tough work and especially so on a day like today , in the middle of the hot season .
hasne cracks a grin and says that , compared to her last job , this is great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reopa employee hasne says she prefers roadwork to her old housework job when her husband died , hasne took up work as a maid to try to support her three children .
she worked long hours but received only meals and a monthly wage of just 200 to 300 taka , or around three euros , in return .
a way out of poverty for hasne , the turning point came when she was chosen to be part of a european union-funded work-for-cash program , the rural employment opportunities for public assets project , reopa .
the program employs vulnerable , poor women to do work that helps their communities , like fixing up the roads , and by bangladesh standards it pays a decent wage : about 23 euros a month .
so far the program has employed over 24000 bangladeshi women – most of them divorced , abandoned or widowed women who would otherwise have little social capital and few economic prospects .
now that she has a regular income , hasne says she receives more respect from the community and is in a better position to look after her children .

german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was on his way to visit the german camp of quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- troops in baghlan , when the news of the clashes between the troops and the taliban came .

his helicopter turned back immediately . " security takes precedence , also for the men there , " guttenberg said . earlier guttenberg paid a visit to the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-e-sharif .
there he took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the machines are supposed to give logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
after that , the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants . bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers escalating insurgency in kunduz , guttenberg also witnessed a demonstration of how armored howitzers that were recently made available to german troops can be used against insurgents . over the past weeks , the taliban have stepped up attacks against international troops .

the german defense minister had recently warned that more casualties were to be expected in the region this summer . motivating soldiers this is guttenberg 's fourth visit to afghanistan since he became the defense minister nine months ago .

" he stressed the decisive role the afghans bring to the stability in the country .
" the german government expects the afghans to show their commitment , " he said in kunduz . his visit comes ahead of an international conference planned for next week in kabul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 16.07.2010 germany loses export race but wins big customer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese consumers like kitchens " made in germany " after dethroning germany as the world 's top exporter , china is quietly becoming one of the country 's biggest customers for a wide range of products .
in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .
" more than 300 million chinese are now able to afford quality refrigerators and air-conditioners .
they want to consume - and they are . " while sales in china account for approximately 15 percent of ebm-papst 's 1 billion euro total revenue , beilke told deutsche welle he expects that share to increase to 25 percent over the next couple of years . china 's booming economy has created wealth for a growing number of people in the country .
for instance , germany luxury carmaker daimler reported earlier this month that its car sales in china topped 13,7000 units last month , a 177 percent year-on-year surge . prefab kitchens even prefab kitchens " made in germany " are in demand .
nobilia , a mid-size manufacturer of kitchen systems , is selling its kitchens to construction companies building huge housing projects in china , according to company spokeswoman sonja diermann . " these are big projects with 1,000-plus apartment units , " diermann told deutsche welle .
" there is a growing group of consumers who have money , seek quality products and know that germany has a good reputation in manufacturing . " bildunterschrift : trade between china and germany has grown steadily while europe and the united state remain germany 's largest export markets , some experts worry that some german manufacturers may be slowly becoming too dependent on china for growth . " dependency on china is an issue with some companies in some sectors , and these companies will need to look at their individual situations , " ralph weichers , chief economist at the german engineering association -lrb- vdma -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" but i would n't push the panic button . " as enticing as the chinese market is for german manufacturers , it is not without its challenges .
chief among them is the protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- .
during her meetings with chinese government officials , merkel again stressed the need to respect patents . ' in the lion 's den ' while admitting that china has taken steps to curb ipr violation in the country , beilke said " copying remains an issue . "
and he speaks from experience . " we 're affected by it , " beilke said .
" but we still have to be in the lion 's den .
the market is too big . " trade between the export powerhouses has grown steadily , to 91 billion dollars last year compared with $ 41 billion in 2001 .
of last year 's total , chinese exports to germany accounted for $ 55 billion and germany 's exports to china for $ 36 billion . author : john blau editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .

merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de strikes -pipe- 16.07.2010 bangladesh garment workers fight for higher wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a garment worker argues with policemen during a protest in dhaka in bangladesh , textile workers who produce clothes for western brands are fighting for an immediate pay rise .
violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .

" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .

" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .
" we are convinced that the japanese , not only as consumers , but also as taxpayers and industrial partners , will be better off for it . "

" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .

ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .

dw fans wrote in to side with michael ballack or philipp lahm in the discussion on who should captain the nationalelf . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .

at least until the city 's busybodies get involved . i do n't own a car .
not for any high-principled carbon-footprint-reducing reasons , but simply because i dislike traffic and feel life is too short to have to run the gauntlet with a dozen other drivers looking for a parking space at the end of every day . when people regale me , as they do in these weeks of extreme heat , with their nightmare tales of trying to get in and out of the city on roads so packed that it takes an hour to travel just a couple of kilometers , i think fondly of my two-wheeler . i do n't do tight shorts or day-glo , have no trouser clips and i do n't - although i probably should - wear a helmet .
but for all that , i 'm a cyclist .
i peddle about town on a no frills bone-shaker , which barring the occasional morning when someone has nicked the valves or stuck a knife into my tire , is about as trusty a means of transport as ever there was . and berlin is not a bad place to get around by fahrrad -lrb- bike -rrb- .
okay , so the cycle path network is a bit arbitrary , and it takes a while to get used to the abuse issued from the mouths of self-important drivers , but on the whole the city feels good from atop a saddle . all the old cliches about wind in the hair and freedom of movement hold true , and there 's something particularly poetic about keeping pace with road-ragers stuck in stop-and-go traffic .
oh , the joy of gliding on by .
and on and on and on … because the unspoken rule of biking in berlin is very much " stop for no one and ignore the traffic lights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even berlin has traffic-free places to ride everyone rides on the pavement especially when it means dodging red lights .
and although both the police and the ordnungsbeamter -lrb- public order officials -rrb- have the power to sting offenders with an on-the-spot fine , they are so outnumbered these days that they rarely seem to bother . plastic bag man not so the city 's vigilantes .
a few months ago i was biking over a quiet bridge - on a cycle path , i hasten to add - when a man with a plastic carrier bag determinedly stepped out in front of me .
he held his hand in the air and told me in no uncertain terms that i was riding on wrong cycle path .
mine , he said , was on the other side of the road . i did what i always do in such situations and pretended not to understand him .
once he clocked that i was foreign , he pointed to the rail tracks below the bridge and spluttered the words " up , down , up down , suicide . " exactly what his floundering foray into english was meant to tell me , i will never know for sure , but i assumed he was warning me that i might end up beneath a train if by persisting in cycling against the flow , i suddenly no longer found myself " up , " but " down . "
i blew him a kiss and went on my way . i cross that bridge several times a week , and although for the most part , i still cycle on the " wrong " path , i do sometimes check to make sure plastic bag man is nowhere in sight .
he never is . if i were to meet him this summer , i doubt my crime would even stand out among the innumerable near misses between wobbling tourist cyclists and hardened berlin bikers .
the latter , it seems are not entirely happy about having to share their turf with hundreds of newcomers , who even i am willing to admit , are a bit of a liability . keeping it real still , that 's no excuse for what i witnessed last weekend when i tried to escape the heat myself by taking a train to the wandlitzsee lake .
i got on behind a man in a wheelchair and took a seat in a spacious compartment which quickly filled with both locals and tourists .
it was a bit of muddle , but it was okay until an unmistakable berliner climbed aboard and started ordering everyone else to stand up and leave so as to make space for his bike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes passersby like to help enforce the rules " you 're not the only ones on this train , " he carped . he was then joined by an equally grouchy conductor who ushered everyone out of the bike carriage .
everyone , that is , except the man in the wheelchair , who , as his wife politely explained , was not in much of a position to oblige .
rather than demonstrate any remorse for his evident faux-pas , the conductor insisted that the compartment , complete with 20 or so foldaway seats , was reserved for bicycles only .
the disabled man would have to find somewhere else to park his two wheels . that , i thought , is taking cycling too seriously .
and just for a moment , i considered joining the other side and getting myself a car . author : tamsin walker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

rights activists have sharply criticized the bill , which they say could be abused . the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament , has approved a bill empowering the country 's secret police , the fsb , to call citizens in for " precautionary talks " for potential crimes agents believe may be committed in the future . under the law , fsb officials would require no evidence to take such action , which proponents of the new powers have said would be intended to prevent the possibility of a later criminal act " against the country 's security . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev spearheaded the fsb initiative the bill had been proposed by president dmitry medvedev and passed the 450-seat lower house of parliament with 354 votes .
most of the supporters were from the ruling united russia party . the country 's upper house , the federation council , must approve the bill before it can be sent to medvedev , whose signature would turn it into law . return of kgb ? but in an open letter to the council , democracy and rights groups have denounced the bill , saying it would herald in a return to conditions under the kgb , the soviet-era predecessor to the fsb . critics have said the powers could be used to intimidate government opponents and suppress protests .
in fact , three activists from the opposition yabloko party were arrested outside the duma for protesting the law as it was passed . signatories of the letter include the president of the moscow bar association , genry reznik ; the chairwoman of the moscow helsinki group , lyudmila alexeyeva ; the head of the russian human rights organization memorial , oleg orlov ; as well as writers and members of the opposition . change in atmosphere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents of the bill have said it gives too much power to agents in the fsb headquarters an 80-year-old veteran human rights campaigner sergei kovalyov said he believes the authorities are afraid of mass unrest , like the 2004 orange revolution in ukraine .
he said there has not been a particular reason or event that necessitates giving extra powers to the security services . " nobody can mention a particular event , because a change in atmosphere is not an event , " kovalyov said .
" but we all feel it .
and -lsb- the bill 's initiators -rsb- are without any doubt the people who are in power , for no-one else can initiate such measures .
they also feel this change in atmosphere . " medvedev , meanwhile , defended the bill .
when questions were raised about the bill during a press conference with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday in yekaterinburg , medvedev , reluctant at first to address the subject , said it was perfectly normal for a country to update security policy . " every country has the right to improve its laws , including those on the security services , and we will do that , " medvedev said .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

but critics have pointed the finger at misfiring plans to float the company on the stock market . travelling on germany 's high-speed ice trains has often been a harrowing experience recently .
horror stories circulated in the german media throughout the week , following an incident saturday when the air-conditioning broke down in a train travelling from berlin .
temperatures reached 50 degrees celsius -lrb- 122 degrees f -rrb- inside the train , and several people were hospitalized in the western german town of bielefeld . " a conductor came into our compartment with a doctor because a young boy was lying on the floor numb , " one anonymous passenger told reporters .
" his mother was really worried .
then she tried to smash a window , but thank god someone stopped her .
it was like in a disaster movie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 16.07.2010 china , germany to hold annual consultations to deepen " strategic partnership " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao seem to get on well despite differences german chancellor angela merkel has begun her visit to china .
her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .

then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .

exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "
the government has a strong interest to keep the situation under control .
prime minister sheikh hasina is expected to announce a new minimum wage compromise at the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhaka , 2007 : protests by garment workers regularly turn violent trade unions not allowed but this will not solve the whole problem , union leaders emphasize .
they say that the main cause for the labor unrest is the garment manufacturers ' refusal to permit trade unions .
" in this situation , in the absence of trade unions , the workers ' problem is coming to the streets , " said amirul haque amin from the national garment workers federation .
" we experience factory blockades because there is no systematic way to address the labor problems within the factory . "
amin also feels that the west bears its share of responsibility and has appealed to western customers to pay fair prices for the garments made in bangladesh .

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?

ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .
the current team , minus ballack , is harmonious and humble ; they also appear to have a great attitude and less ego .
ballack on the team changes the dynamic of the national team for the worse .
i am very proud of lahm ; he 's a humble giant who demonstrated leadership on the field and off .
lahm set the tone for the team , which ultimately led deutschland to third place ; which was fantastic .
this young team is a bunch of heroes to all of germany .
to be honest , no one missed ballack . - daniel , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .
just the fact that he is enjoying himself does not entitle him to a job where he was just a caretaker .
had he played , ballack would have been better at set pieces and contributed when field goals looked unlikely . - vizzy , india my impression is that ballack held back many players on the national team .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

her talks with chinese leaders focused on closer cooperation .
both countries indicated their willingness to develop a comprehensive " strategic partnership " . the german chancellor received a warm reception in beijing on friday .
due to the hot and sticky weather , and possibly the smog in beijing , the ceremonials including a guard of honor were shifted inside the great hall of the people .
the chinese leaders went to great lengths to treat angela merkel cordially .
premier wen jiabao devoted a considerable amount of time to the chancellor .
afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

but critics have pointed the finger at misfiring plans to float the company on the stock market . travelling on germany 's high-speed ice trains has often been a harrowing experience recently .
horror stories circulated in the german media throughout the week , following an incident saturday when the air-conditioning broke down in a train travelling from berlin .
temperatures reached 50 degrees celsius -lrb- 122 degrees f -rrb- inside the train , and several people were hospitalized in the western german town of bielefeld . " a conductor came into our compartment with a doctor because a young boy was lying on the floor numb , " one anonymous passenger told reporters .

when outside temperatures breach 32 degrees celsius , the systems on ice 2 trains routinely fail to keep the interior cool .
deutsche bahn chief ruediger grube was quick to apologize for the mess , but pointed the finger at climate change . " we have of course analyzed the weather situation in connection with the air conditioning system , " he said .
" and we found that in the last 20 years , only five days were hotter than 37 degrees .

" and if you then do things like invest over a 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- in a general overhaul but leave the air conditioning systems in , then that is simply irresponsible .
this morning grube just said they are considering putting in new systems . " wolf said he believes the maintenance problem is a direct result of the failed plan to float the company on the stock market .
this idea has been mooted for many years , and has led to expensive foreign investments to boost the image of the company . " a week ago , grube made the decision a week ago to buy european bus and rail operator arriva , " wolf said , " for nearly 3 billion euros and not to invest this money in the improvement of the domestic rail service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 16.07.2010 programs in bangladesh offer women the chance at a decent day 's work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in the eu-funded reopa cash-for-work program get their hands dirty the bangladesh constitution might promise gender equality , but discrimination is still widespread – especially in rural areas .
these are the areas eu-funded programs are targeting to try to lift women out of poverty . bangladesh has made some inroads in its attempt to achieve gender equality : dowry payments have been banned , primary school classrooms around the country are filled with as many little girls as boys , and the top government job is filled by a woman , prime minister sheikh hasina .
but the south-asian country still has a way to go .
the oecd social institutions and gender index puts it at number 90 out of a possible 102 non-oecd countries analyzed , making it one of the world 's most discriminatory countries towards women .
rape and acid attacks are still relatively common , and in the home , men still wield most of the decision-making and economic power – which leaves bangladesh 's women , especially its millions of divorced , abandoned or widowed women , in a precarious position .
the challenges these women face can be especially severe in the more conservative rural areas .
these are the places european union donors have been targeting with programs aimed at helping lift women out of poverty for good .
in a small village in sirajganj district , in the north-east of bangladesh , 40-year-old hasne is hard at work .
she and a handful of other women are doing maintenance on the dirt track that is this the village 's main thoroughfare .
they take turns carrying mud and clumps of earth up from the main road and stamping it down onto the dirt path .
it 's tough work and especially so on a day like today , in the middle of the hot season .
hasne cracks a grin and says that , compared to her last job , this is great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reopa employee hasne says she prefers roadwork to her old housework job when her husband died , hasne took up work as a maid to try to support her three children .
she worked long hours but received only meals and a monthly wage of just 200 to 300 taka , or around three euros , in return .
a way out of poverty for hasne , the turning point came when she was chosen to be part of a european union-funded work-for-cash program , the rural employment opportunities for public assets project , reopa .
the program employs vulnerable , poor women to do work that helps their communities , like fixing up the roads , and by bangladesh standards it pays a decent wage : about 23 euros a month .
so far the program has employed over 24000 bangladeshi women – most of them divorced , abandoned or widowed women who would otherwise have little social capital and few economic prospects .
now that she has a regular income , hasne says she receives more respect from the community and is in a better position to look after her children .
" the first thing i did was send my children to school , and i did some repairs on my house .
i can afford good food now .
and we installed a tube well so that we can have safe drinking water , " she said .
there are thousands of programs like this one , not just in bangladesh but across the developing world .
the catch is that women like hasne must leave the program after two years so that a new round of women can participate .
throughout their employment , the women save almost a third of their wages to be invested later in a business or in property .
" we mentally prepare them to become ready to take the fight on after the job , because the job is not for life , " said kajal chatterjee , reopa capacity strengthening advisor for this region .
" -lsb- we say : -rsb- you have to save some money , and you have to learn how to utilize this money on your own , and to survive .
so i think the main principle here is self-sustainability . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment and assets like cows help women today - and hopefully tomorrow , too reopa has just entered its second phase , and with 98 percent of participants continuing to earn over a euro a day after leaving the program , organizers are calling the first phase a success .
bangladesh 's island poor do it tough a similar program run in the river island region , the chars livelihood program , offers poor families an income-generating asset – typically a cow – rather than employment .
program leader malcolm marks said that the program seeks to assist the poorest inhabitants of the chars , or islands , rather than women in particular – although the poorest families are often female-headed households .
" over time -lsb- the women -rsb- have become … economically empowered , " he said .
" they 're actually earning a good income from their animals , and this in itself is also socially empowering .
bangladesh is a country that has a society that is very hierarchical .
the class system is very much in place . " giving women a status symbol object like a cow helps them earn a living , but it also gives them a leg up the social ladder , marks said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this little girl 's parents can feed her properly , in part because of their participation in the chars livelihoods program according to the most recent undp millennium goals progress report for bangladesh , wage employment for women in bangladesh is still low – one in eight – and , unlike other development indicators in the country , it 's on the way down .
purdah , or the segregation of men and women for cultural and religious reasons , is observed in various forms across the country but especially in conservative rural areas , where women are often expected to stay in the home and where many can not travel without a male relative accompanying them .
more than mere glass ceilings to contend with in the cities , where women often work outside the home , even women who make it to the top face a struggle .
bilkis nahar is a successful television news editor who works in the capital , dhaka .
she said that when she first became an editor , the male reporters working under her had trouble accepting their new boss because they were unaccustomed to women occupying senior positions . nahar was one of the first female news editors in the country .
" day after day i had to fight -lsb- to show -rsb- that i am capable of that position , and they accepted me after a long time .
but it 's not finished , " she said .
although the bangladeshi government has passed legislation to ban dowry payments and discourage parents from marrying off their young daughters , women 's advocacy groups have pointed to discriminatory inheritance laws as an area that must also be reformed if bangladeshi women are ever to experience a significant shift in status .
fundamental reforms may be needed for real change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv editor bilkis nahar says even though a woman , sheikh hasina , has bangladesh 's top job , ordinary women still face discrimination islamic law in the majority muslim nation dictates that a daughter inherit only half as much as her brothers , and women are unlikely to claim their share of family property unless it is offered to them .
" this situation is actually hampering the inner power of women to be empowered , " nahar said .
nahar says that programs in which women are given access to an income or assets fail to address more fundamental structures in bangladesh society that are halting progress in empowering women .
" a very small percentage of women is working at a decision-making level .
so it means that they 're not enjoying a lot of freedom in their workplaces , or in their home , in their school or others , because of -lsb- the -rsb- male-dominated society , and the mentality and social structure of that country , " she said .
but back in hasne 's village in sirajganj there are some promising signs that those shifts are already starting to take place .
men and children are crowding around the track hasne and the other women are working on .
one of the men , saiful islam , says he and the other villagers have more respect for the women now that they 're earning their own money .
as a matter of fact , the 38-year-old rickshaw-puller says , he would n't mind trading places with them .

in fact , experts warn of a growing dependency in some sectors . german exports have surged in recent months , fuelled in large part by strong chinese domestic demand .
numerous manufacturers across germany see china as a key driver in their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis that led to a dramatic drop in exports worldwide . underscoring the robust business ties between the two export giants , german chancellor angela merkel brought the heads of major german corporations with her on a four-day visit to china this week . on friday , the german companies signed contracts worth billons of euros .
among them : a $ 3.5 billion -lrb- 2.7 billion euro -rrb- deal between siemens and shanghai electric power generation equipment to develop steam and gas turbines and a 6.35 billion yuan -lrb- 720 million euro -rrb- venture between daimler and beiqi foton motor to build trucks . grabbing a chunk of the business but not only the giants of german manufacturing are benefitting from growing chinese demand , mid-size producers are also grabbing a chunk of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and wen jiabao have met several times to discuss business " china is our number one growth market , " said hans-jochen beilke , chief executive officer of ebm-papst , which specializes in ventilation , air-conditioning and refrigeration technologies .

wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .

as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

afterwards , during their common press briefing , both sides stressed their desire for close cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel inspects the guard of honor in beijing regular annual meetings planned " we can raise our relationship to an unprecedented level , " angela merkel said .
" we have a strategic partnership that we are going to further expand in future .
i think it is good and important that we express this by having regular consultations between the heads of government of both countries .
from now on , we 'll hold these once a year . "
wen jiabao also praised bilateral ties , particularly the economic ties which are the main focus of merkel 's current visit .
among the deals signed in her presence was an agreement between germany 's automotive group daimler and china 's foton motor , who plan to jointly produce heavy trucks in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has sold almost a million cars in china in the first half of 2010 " the german-chinese ties have passed the test of the international financial crisis , " premier wen said and added that both countries had coordinated their reactions to the crisis very well .
merkel urges china to open markets but the german chancellor also had a few critical words to say .
merkel urged china to grant german companies better access to the chinese market and to clamp down on product piracy .
" i have pointed out that we do n't want barriers for foreign investors in china , and that we 'll continue our long-standing discussions about protecting intellectual property . "
merkel also rejected chinese calls for eu market economy status , which would facilitate chinese exports to europe .
she said beijing had not fulfilled all the criteria yet , notably in the field of intellectual property rights .
friendly atmosphere despite differences certain differences also surfaced during the german-chinese dialogue forum on friday morning , when the role of the media was discussed .
angela merkel emphasized the media 's responsibility to disseminate information and to criticize while premier wen jiabao clearly saw the role of the media quite differently : as a servant of the government .
bildunterschrift : china had protested when merkel received the dalai lama in berlin in 2007 " the media should report more about the positive sides of german-chinese friendship and cooperation " , and about interaction between young people , wen said , arguing that this would benefit both countries and the whole world .
but such differences aside , merkel and wen clearly have established a considerable amount of common ground .
as a gesture of this friendship , the premier is set to accompany the chancellor to the historic western city of xi 'an , where merkel plans to visit the excavation site of the world-famous terracotta warriors on saturday .

an anti-olympic movement has formed , there are funding issues and bid committee chief willy bogner has had to deny press reports of his resignation . munich has managed to secure more funding for its bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , but still not the amount bid committee chief executive willy bogner had hoped for .
the bid committee was able to secure three million euros of additional cash , raising the budget to 33 million euros , short of an expected 37 million euros .
" we thought we 'd get a bit more , " bogner said after a crisis meeting on thursday , where he also dismissed speculation that he was about to throw in the towel .
" we now have to see where we can save four million euros , " he said , adding that he still hoped to present " a decent application . "
the state premier of bavaria , of which munich is the capital , promptly rebuffed bogner 's negative stance in a news conference after the meeting , demanding a " first-class bid " instead .
squabbling and protest movements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants a " first-class bid " for munich premier horst seehofer is keen to end squabbling between bogner , the state of bavaria , munich and the ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen , which is crucial to the bid because of its snowy alps .
" we ca n't let such issues rumble on , they have to be sorted out .
we need to clarify the financial situation and mr. bogner 's investment plan as well as the situation in garmisch , " he said .
locals in garmisch-partenkirchen and munich are concerned about the damage the olympics could do to the environment as well as the attitude of bogner and his team .
" mr. bogner and his bid committee are unbelievably patronizing to residents .
they 're arrogant , condescending and absolutely unprofessional .
at some point the situation will just erupt , ” said alex doering , who is involved in the anti-olympic initiative nolympia 2018 .
a referendum held two weeks ago in oberammergau , about 10 kilometers north of garmisch-partenkirchen , already toppled plans for the town to host the biathlon and cross-country races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ski resort garmisch-partenkirchen is crucial to munich 's bid soccer support on the bright side , german bundesliga football champions bayern munich have thrown their support behind munich 's bid .
the team 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge has criticized opponents to the bid , saying he is irritated by the " obstructionists , " as he calls them .
since the beginning of the week , a petition against the bid has been circulating in garmisch-partenkirchen , but the organizers of the bid are confident that farmers in the area will permit the use of their land .
" the most important thing is that we speak their language , so they do n't have the feeling they are signing something under pressure , " joachim faerber , spokesman for munich 2018 , said after thursday 's meeting .
" -lsb- seehofer -rsb- and the lord mayor of munich were all confident after today 's meeting that the clouds are gone and the sun 's coming through , " he added .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

according to it lawyer dominik boecker , the country has a tradition of data protection going back to the 1970s . in recent months , various government officials across germany have investigated possible privacy violations committed by tech companies including google and facebook .
street view , which google would like to bring to germany , is a worldwide service that provides detailed , street-level photographs of various cities .
it is currently available in many parts of the united states , united kingdom , france and other countries but various german ministers have complained about google 's lack of transparency with their data collection policy , which has led to a delay in the rollout of the service .
similarly , facebook has undergone similar scrutiny for being non-compliant with german privacy laws .
just last month , germany 's consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , said that she would quit facebook over her frustration with the company 's attitude .
deutsche welle spoke with dominik boecker , an it lawyer with greyhills rechtsanwaelte in cologne , to learn more about the historical context of these recent government actions .
deutsche welle : where do we get these privacy protection laws in germany – where do they come from ?
dominik boecker : the history of privacy protection laws in germany is quite old .
historically seen , the nazis and the third reich had lists of people that they thought of as being jewish .
and therefore the germans were very sensitive or very careful about lists that were made by the federal state .
the oldest privacy and data protection law is from 1970 .
it 's the law of the state hessen .
hessen 's law is the oldest data protection law in the world .
all the other states of germany filed laws until the 1990s when eastern germany became part of the federal republic .
was it immediately after the reconstruction of germany that there was starting to be some thinking about these laws ?
you said that the state of hessen did n't have a law until 1970 and that 's obviously 25 years after the end of the war .
so was there anything that happened during that period ?
there was some kind of data protection by common laws , like the right to be left alone , and privacy issues were handled without explicit legal rules .
the courts took the privacy issue into the rights of the person and when it became obvious that that was n't enough , then the specialized laws were made .
so the data protection did n't start in the 70s , but started earlier , but it became obvious that an explicit law had to be made .
so what would be an example of what this law was protecting against ?
for example , if the city of cologne thinks about adding information about their inhabitants and the religion they belong to .
then , there has to be a law allowing the city to collect this data .
to explicitly allow the collection of that type of data ?
exactly .
it has to be explicitly allowed to collect that kind of data .
if there is no law , only if the person is wiling to give away this information for free .
it seems like one of the results of the over-collection of data and abuse of data in germany , particularly by the third reich and maybe later on by the stasi , is that the default has been that collecting less data is better .
or that in order to use the data that you do collect , or to collect at all that you need explicit , opt-in , permission ?
that was the intention of the law , that those data can only be collected legally if there 's a law allowing this or if the person says it 's ok if you collect my data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite its roadblocks , chancellor angela merkel said in february that germany would not block street view would you say that what 's going on now with google , can be tied back to this explicit thing , and that 's why germany has this problem with google going around taking pictures of people 's houses ?
they 're not giving their explicit permission to do it ?
that 's one part and one legal argument in the case against google that might or might not be filed .
of the privacy and data protection laws that we have now , we talked about how those were a response to what happened now 60 years ago .
but that was 60 years ago .
do you think that the laws are appropriate ?
i really do think and i do believe that those laws were appropriate .
one of the big problems and one of the strange things happening is that you need a law to collect the data or you need the person 's permission .
if you have the person 's permission you can nearly do everything you like with the data as long as you inform them beforehand what you 're going to be doing with this data .
as a private company , if you go to people on the street and ask them private questions and tell them that you 're going to be anonymizing the data and the people give their permission to do that , then that 's fine .
but the problem is that not every german person , especially pupils , are particularly fluent in english .
the language of the internet is english and if someone wants to be in facebook , he has to comply with the rules facebook dictates .
facebook , and not only facebook , but other media companies have very very lax restrictions in consideration of privacy protection .
and that 's a problem between the german law and the us private companies that are acting in germany .
that 's unsolved and i 'm not sure how it can be solved , making a profit for the companies and protecting the data .
so the law is out of date ?
it 's quite out of date .
it 's became more international .
us firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
spanish firms are selling their goods and services in germany .
there has to be a harmonization in europe and more importantly preferably worldwide to get a minimum of consensus on data protection .

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .
" it is in no one 's interest to jeopardize that .
we are very careful that we do n't miss this opportunity of the global recovery which has just started to have a positive impact on our export growth . "

violent protests recently erupted in the industrial zone of ashulia near the capital dhaka . last month , tens of thousands of workers vandalised factory equipment , torched delivery vans and erected barricades in the streets .
the police responded with rubber bullets , teargas and water cannons .
several hundred factories had to be closed temporarily .
an estimated three million workers , most of them women , are employed in the bangladeshi garment industry .
many of them receive no more than the minimum wage : around 1600 taka -lrb- 20 euros -rrb- .
despite rising food and energy prices , the salaries in the garment industry have remained unchanged since 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory security guards inspect the damage after violent protests at a factory in ashulia minimum wage one of the lowest in the world the workers ' situation is very grave , amirul haque amin , head of bangladesh 's national garment workers federation , told deutsche welle .
" with the salary that was fixed years ago it is quite impossible to survive , that is why we demand 5000 taka as minimum . " amin added that the current minimum wage is one of the lowest in the world .
in the meantime , the violent protests have been put on hold .
the workers are waiting for a sign from the government .
a tripartite commission of government officials , industry representatives and independent members has been set up to negotiate a new minimum wage .
but the interests diverge , said mustafizur rahman , director of the centre for policy dialogue think tank .
" the entrepreneurs are saying they are passing through a difficult period : the cost of doing business has gone up , the price of yarn has gone up , so they are ready to raise the minimum wage , but not to the extent that the workers are demanding . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most garment workers in bangladesh are women cheap labor crucial to compete on world market bangladesh entrepreneurs know that low labor costs give them a huge opportunity to compete with the big rival china .
as wages in china are rising , many multinationals have started looking for cheaper production countries .
but in order to attract more foreign investment , bangladesh can not afford labor unrest , explained mustafizur rahman .
" so the tricky thing for the minimum wage commission is to find a golden mean which will be acceptable to the entrepreneurs and still allow bangladesh to compete in the global market . "
bangladesh 's economy relies heavily on the garment industry , which accounts for 80 per cent of the country 's exports .
but following the global crisis , the growth rate plunged to almost zero in the last year .
only very recently have new orders started coming in , said economist rahman .

he also stressed that japan , the world 's second largest economy after the united states , should not shun the fragile euro , despite a recent crisis involving debt-laden greece .
" it is not in japan 's best interest to turn away from the euro , " fillon said , adding that the single currency had stabilized somewhat through concerted eu action .
" true , there is no doubt that the eurozone has gone through the most serious crisis in its history , " said the french premier during a two-day visit to japan .
but he argued there was nothing inherently wrong with the single currency used by more than half of the 27 european union member states .
" was the crisis caused by the single currency ?
absolutely not , " he said .
" we have witnessed a classic sovereign debt crisis with badly managed public finances . "
fillon said europe 's economic heavyweights , such as germany - the eu 's largest economy and the world 's fourth largest - were committed to " strengthening its position as a hub of budgetary stability and growth . "
the premier , who belongs to president nicolas sarkozy 's ump party , also spoke of europe 's wish to see japan drop market barriers for goods including new medicines and railway products , with a view to a possible japan-eu free trade agreement .
" on all of these matters , we wish to see rapid and tangible progress , " he said .
" we are convinced that the japanese , not only as consumers , but also as taxpayers and industrial partners , will be better off for it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 16.07.2010 german national team captaincy drama rivets readers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's pre-world cup injury made lahm interim captain now that the world cup is over , the soap opera can begin .
dw fans wrote in to side with michael ballack or philipp lahm in the discussion on who should captain the nationalelf . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .

ballack chooses leverkusen unveiling to stoke captaincy feud in my opinion , based heavily on what i witnessed from watching the world cup , i believe ballack should step down as captain .
he 's had his moment in the spotlight and at the helm of the national team , but it 's time for him to step aside and let lahm fill those shoes .
germany did beautifully without ballack , and i am so proud of them .
we could have won this world cup with this team , but i believe they began to doubt themselves in the lead-up to the match with spain .
still third place is worth something and we know we have a good shot in 2014 with this team .
ballack 's injury created a unique opportunity for germany , in that it removed the stopper at the top and allowed the rest of the players below to surge up and fill the gap .
game play was spread out to the rest of the team and they worked as a cohesive unit .
ballack 's return would reverse that and bring the concentration back on him .
lahm should become the new captain for germany , but i do n't agree with how he 's going about it .
it is n't right for him to declare that his temporary status is to become permanent .
the change needs to come from the top , not from the bottom .
ballack should realize that what 's best for germany is for him to relinquish his command to lahm , but it should be him , or team coach joachim loew to decide that , not lahm .
undermining the authority and position of the captain is n't right even if lahm is the best man for the job . - brandenn , us i strongly believe that michael ballack has no right to claim the captaincy of the national team .
this is entirely the coach 's decision and that must be respected by both ballack and lahm .
i also believe that the current young team stands a much better chance for success and that ballack should step aside and allow the next generation to take over .
he had his turn .
as great as ballack once was , we all saw what happened to the teams with " older " players in this past world cup . - stefan , canada i feel that it is very unfair for lothar matthaeus and uli hoeness to claim that the german team did not miss ballack in south africa based on the team 's performance against australia , england and argentina .
it would be nice to hear their comments on the team 's performance against serbia and spain .
yes , the young team has shown great potential by their four-goal margin but for all we know the team could have gone on to achieve six goals or more if ballack were on the team partnered with schweinsteiger , who has shown great improvement in his new position .
i feel that there is no reason why ballack should not be given a chance to lead the german team in the euro 2012 if he is 100 percent fit .
he has , after all , shown the entire world that he is capable of changing a game when he is in top form . - elena , malaysia michael ballack should captain the germany team to euro 2012 , after that he might hang his boots for the young players to carry on with the germany team .
i think schweinsteiger should take over the captaincy after michael ballack . - solz , us i think ballack 's character is out of place .
it is a shame that this is happening to a wonderful team who has succeeded in showing a spectacular play and creating an image of sportsmanship as well as " working as a team . "
his injury is truly unfortunate , but the " young " team worked its way out of tough times amidst national negativity .
how has he contributed to this team ?
he has to catch up as the team grew during his absence .
first , he has to be back in form , then he probably has to redefine his " captaincy " ... he ca n't just ride the bandwagon . - just another new german team fan , us the very timing of lahm 's assertion , just before what should have been the match of his life , and at a time when ballack was down , shows lahm is not fit to be captain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 16.07.2010 sudan 's path to referendum fraught with obstacles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan is currently united under one flag .
but for how long ?
north and south sudanese leaders have begun talks on a strategy for a peaceful transition should a 2011 referendum result in the south gaining its independence .
but experts say time is running out to clarify all points . in six months time , sudan will vote in an historic referendum on whether the war-scarred south will gain independence .
but leaders from the north and south have a substantial number of details to clarify before the january 2011 vote .
" there 's a huge area to cover , but politicians on both sides realize that whatever happens at the referendum , they 're going to have to work out how the relationship is going to be framed in the future , " said roger middleton , a researcher in the african program of london-based think tank chatham house .
talks to continue talks between president omar al-bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- and the former southern rebel sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- kicked off in khartoum last weekend and were due to continue on july 19 .
the negotiations are focusing on how to ensure a peaceful transition after the referendum , in which the south is expected to vote in favor of self-rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : omar al-bashir voted in the election , which observers called ' chaotic ' the referendum is part of the comprehensive peace agreement -lrb- cpa -rrb- , signed in january 2005 between the ncp and splm , which ended decades of civil war in sudan .
according to middleton , the parties are aware of the difficult task they face .
" they know the costs of going back to war are huge - for both sides , " he told deutsche welle .
" there 's a huge codependency they have on peace . "
but elke grawert , a political scientist and sudan expert at the university of bremen , said it was unlikely that all points of discussion will be fully clarified in time .
" i think they will make some progress in resolving the issues , but it is imperative that the parties aim for a post-referendum process in which further negotiations take place , " grawert told deutsche welle .
oil is the crux four key issues are on the agenda for the talks over the next months : sharing oil resources , citizenship , security and respect of international agreements .
but observers agree that the pivotal point will be oil , as it plays a major role in sudan 's economy .
in addition to the referendum on southern independence , the oil-rich abyei region will also vote in january on which side to join .
according to the international monetary fund , oil now accounts for about 95 percent of sudan 's exports and over half of all government revenue .
most oil reserves are located in southern sudan , but the region is totally dependent on northern pipelines to funnel its crude to the red sea .
an agreement to share oil revenues was a key aspect of the cpa .
however , how these revenues should be split in the future poses a particular challenge after the referendum , said amy barry from the non-governmental organization global witness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the peace accord was signed in 2005 , many sudanese rejoiced .
" it 's a real catch-22 situation , " barry said .
" if the south , which is landlocked , decides on independence at the referendum , which it is expected to do , it will be almost entirely dependent on the north in order to export its oil .
so how are they going to ensure a fair and transparent oil deal post-january 2011 ? "
in an interview with deutsche welle , barry said preparations for a new deal have been " very inadequate . "
but more transparency was necessary in order to enable peace to last in a post-referendum situation .
grawert agreed that the handling of the oil resources required precise contracts .
" the course needs to be set for economic and political cooperation between both parts of the country , as they already now are economically linked , " said grawert , who heads the international research project " governance and social action in sudan after the peace agreement of january 2005 " with partners from universities in sudan , ethiopia and kenya .
the cpa expires six months after the referendum .
all interim agreements will run out at that time .
international pressure there are other key issues that need to be dealt with .
grawert pointed out that the future border between north and south left many questions open .
" what does that mean for nomadic tribes that are used to wandering between northern and southern sudan , in particular cattle breeders ? " she said .
" and what about citizenship issues ? "
overall , sudan is " alarmingly unprepared " for the critical referendum , according to a report by a global coalition of 26 humanitarian and human rights organizations published this week .
inadequate preparation was harming the chance of a credible vote on january 9 , 2011 .
role of the african union " the clock is ticking fast towards what might be the most important date in modern sudanese history , " the report " renewing the pledge : re-engaging the guarantors to the sudanese comprehensive peace agreement " said .
the cpa 's guarantors include the african union -lrb- au -rrb- , european union , united nations and the united states .
barry from global witness , which is part of this global coalition , said african leaders in particular had a key role to play in ensuring transparency .
the au will be holding its annual summit in uganda beginning monday .
" it 's a political signal that could be very usefully sent from the african summit in uganda , " barry said .
" the joint coalition report calls for them to reaffirm their support for the right of the southern sudanese to self-determination .
they should pledge to recognize the outcome of a free and fair referendum . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil will be a pivotal point in sudenese talks middleton from chatham house said it was in the interest of the au to observe developments .
but how much the body needed to be involved would depend not so much on the actual agreements that are reached , but on the " feeling " between the two sides .
" i think if agreements are reached in an openness and generousness between north and south , that makes for a much more positive relationship going forward , " middleton said .
" if agreements are done grudgingly , the international community is going to want to be there to put more pressure on the two states to avoid situations which might revert to war . "
transparency will be crucial elections held in sudan in april of this year were viewed as a test run for the upcoming referendum .
the carter center , founded by former us president jimmy carter , monitored the process .
it concluded that the vote - which declared president al-bashir the winner - was " chaotic , non-transparent and vulnerable to electoral manipulation . "
should such lack of transparency also be observed at the january referendum , it could have disastrous consequences for the country , said alfred lokuji , an expert of the peace process based in southern sudan . "
northern sudan can ignore a vote for secession and claim that it was all rigged and if it 's a vote for unity , southern sudan can say it was all rigged , " lokuji told deutsche welle .
" whatever you do , you run into risks unless it 's well organized and as transparent as it possibly can be made . "
discussions are ' a good sign ' the current talks between the ncp and splm are a first step .
middleton said he was " cautiously optimistic " on progress .
" the fact that they 're talking is a good sign , " he said .
" of course , it 's much later than would have been ideal .
it would have been great if they 'd started these conversations a year ago rather than with months until the referendum .
but at least they 're doing it . "
and it appears they will not be marred by an arrest warrant against president al-bashir .
the international criminal court in the hague issued a second warrant this week on charges of genocide .

however , one base visit was called off due to fighting with taliban militants . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg had intended to fly into the field , beyond the walls of the major bundeswehr base in kunduz , afghanistan , to see front line troops working with the quick reaction force -lrb- qrf -rrb- out of a small camp in baglan .
however , the troop commander there advised guttenberg on friday to cancel his plans because the qrf soldiers were engaged in heavy fighting with taliban militants in the northern region .
" security takes precedence , also for the men there , " the defense minister said , after stepping back off his helicopter that was bound for baglan .
guttenberg had been airborne for roughly 10 minutes when he was advised to turn back .
the bundeswehr commander in kunduz , colonel reinhardt zudrop , said it 's always possible for fighting to break out in the region , where four german troops were killed three months ago .
" the incident is in keeping with the general picture of high activity we have been experiencing in the northern region of late , " zudrop said .
bildunterschrift : one of the aims of guttenberg 's visit is to boost the morale of soldiers guttenberg had insisted on visiting the troops in a more volatile region on his visit , saying he wanted to get the soldiers ' view of the situation and motivate them in a critical phase of their mission .
earlier , guttenberg visited the headquarters of the international security assistance force for northern afghanistan in mazar-i-sharif and took part in a ceremony to deploy 40 new us-made helicopters in the region .
the helicopters are tasked with providing logistical support to the german troops , such as providing transport for the wounded .
the defense minister traveled on to kunduz , where he expressed concerns over the increasing " professionalism " of taliban militants .
guttenberg 's two-day visit to afghanistan was his fourth since taking office as defense minister .
he is due back in berlin on friday evening .

at least until the city 's busybodies get involved . i do n't own a car .
not for any high-principled carbon-footprint-reducing reasons , but simply because i dislike traffic and feel life is too short to have to run the gauntlet with a dozen other drivers looking for a parking space at the end of every day . when people regale me , as they do in these weeks of extreme heat , with their nightmare tales of trying to get in and out of the city on roads so packed that it takes an hour to travel just a couple of kilometers , i think fondly of my two-wheeler . i do n't do tight shorts or day-glo , have no trouser clips and i do n't - although i probably should - wear a helmet .
but for all that , i 'm a cyclist .
i peddle about town on a no frills bone-shaker , which barring the occasional morning when someone has nicked the valves or stuck a knife into my tire , is about as trusty a means of transport as ever there was . and berlin is not a bad place to get around by fahrrad -lrb- bike -rrb- .
okay , so the cycle path network is a bit arbitrary , and it takes a while to get used to the abuse issued from the mouths of self-important drivers , but on the whole the city feels good from atop a saddle . all the old cliches about wind in the hair and freedom of movement hold true , and there 's something particularly poetic about keeping pace with road-ragers stuck in stop-and-go traffic .
oh , the joy of gliding on by .
and on and on and on … because the unspoken rule of biking in berlin is very much " stop for no one and ignore the traffic lights . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even berlin has traffic-free places to ride everyone rides on the pavement especially when it means dodging red lights .
and although both the police and the ordnungsbeamter -lrb- public order officials -rrb- have the power to sting offenders with an on-the-spot fine , they are so outnumbered these days that they rarely seem to bother . plastic bag man not so the city 's vigilantes .
a few months ago i was biking over a quiet bridge - on a cycle path , i hasten to add - when a man with a plastic carrier bag determinedly stepped out in front of me .
he held his hand in the air and told me in no uncertain terms that i was riding on wrong cycle path .
mine , he said , was on the other side of the road . i did what i always do in such situations and pretended not to understand him .
once he clocked that i was foreign , he pointed to the rail tracks below the bridge and spluttered the words " up , down , up down , suicide . " exactly what his floundering foray into english was meant to tell me , i will never know for sure , but i assumed he was warning me that i might end up beneath a train if by persisting in cycling against the flow , i suddenly no longer found myself " up , " but " down . "
i blew him a kiss and went on my way . i cross that bridge several times a week , and although for the most part , i still cycle on the " wrong " path , i do sometimes check to make sure plastic bag man is nowhere in sight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 16.07.2010 programs in bangladesh offer women the chance at a decent day 's work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in the eu-funded reopa cash-for-work program get their hands dirty the bangladesh constitution might promise gender equality , but discrimination is still widespread – especially in rural areas .
these are the areas eu-funded programs are targeting to try to lift women out of poverty . bangladesh has made some inroads in its attempt to achieve gender equality : dowry payments have been banned , primary school classrooms around the country are filled with as many little girls as boys , and the top government job is filled by a woman , prime minister sheikh hasina .
but the south-asian country still has a way to go .
the oecd social institutions and gender index puts it at number 90 out of a possible 102 non-oecd countries analyzed , making it one of the world 's most discriminatory countries towards women .
rape and acid attacks are still relatively common , and in the home , men still wield most of the decision-making and economic power – which leaves bangladesh 's women , especially its millions of divorced , abandoned or widowed women , in a precarious position .
the challenges these women face can be especially severe in the more conservative rural areas .
these are the places european union donors have been targeting with programs aimed at helping lift women out of poverty for good .
in a small village in sirajganj district , in the north-east of bangladesh , 40-year-old hasne is hard at work .
she and a handful of other women are doing maintenance on the dirt track that is this the village 's main thoroughfare .
they take turns carrying mud and clumps of earth up from the main road and stamping it down onto the dirt path .
it 's tough work and especially so on a day like today , in the middle of the hot season .
hasne cracks a grin and says that , compared to her last job , this is great .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reopa employee hasne says she prefers roadwork to her old housework job when her husband died , hasne took up work as a maid to try to support her three children .
she worked long hours but received only meals and a monthly wage of just 200 to 300 taka , or around three euros , in return .
a way out of poverty for hasne , the turning point came when she was chosen to be part of a european union-funded work-for-cash program , the rural employment opportunities for public assets project , reopa .
the program employs vulnerable , poor women to do work that helps their communities , like fixing up the roads , and by bangladesh standards it pays a decent wage : about 23 euros a month .
so far the program has employed over 24000 bangladeshi women – most of them divorced , abandoned or widowed women who would otherwise have little social capital and few economic prospects .
now that she has a regular income , hasne says she receives more respect from the community and is in a better position to look after her children .
" the first thing i did was send my children to school , and i did some repairs on my house .
i can afford good food now .
and we installed a tube well so that we can have safe drinking water , " she said .
there are thousands of programs like this one , not just in bangladesh but across the developing world .
the catch is that women like hasne must leave the program after two years so that a new round of women can participate .
throughout their employment , the women save almost a third of their wages to be invested later in a business or in property .
" we mentally prepare them to become ready to take the fight on after the job , because the job is not for life , " said kajal chatterjee , reopa capacity strengthening advisor for this region .
" -lsb- we say : -rsb- you have to save some money , and you have to learn how to utilize this money on your own , and to survive .
so i think the main principle here is self-sustainability . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment and assets like cows help women today - and hopefully tomorrow , too reopa has just entered its second phase , and with 98 percent of participants continuing to earn over a euro a day after leaving the program , organizers are calling the first phase a success .
bangladesh 's island poor do it tough a similar program run in the river island region , the chars livelihood program , offers poor families an income-generating asset – typically a cow – rather than employment .
program leader malcolm marks said that the program seeks to assist the poorest inhabitants of the chars , or islands , rather than women in particular – although the poorest families are often female-headed households .
" over time -lsb- the women -rsb- have become … economically empowered , " he said .
" they 're actually earning a good income from their animals , and this in itself is also socially empowering .
bangladesh is a country that has a society that is very hierarchical .
the class system is very much in place . " giving women a status symbol object like a cow helps them earn a living , but it also gives them a leg up the social ladder , marks said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this little girl 's parents can feed her properly , in part because of their participation in the chars livelihoods program according to the most recent undp millennium goals progress report for bangladesh , wage employment for women in bangladesh is still low – one in eight – and , unlike other development indicators in the country , it 's on the way down .
purdah , or the segregation of men and women for cultural and religious reasons , is observed in various forms across the country but especially in conservative rural areas , where women are often expected to stay in the home and where many can not travel without a male relative accompanying them .
more than mere glass ceilings to contend with in the cities , where women often work outside the home , even women who make it to the top face a struggle .
bilkis nahar is a successful television news editor who works in the capital , dhaka .
she said that when she first became an editor , the male reporters working under her had trouble accepting their new boss because they were unaccustomed to women occupying senior positions . nahar was one of the first female news editors in the country .
" day after day i had to fight -lsb- to show -rsb- that i am capable of that position , and they accepted me after a long time .
but it 's not finished , " she said .
although the bangladeshi government has passed legislation to ban dowry payments and discourage parents from marrying off their young daughters , women 's advocacy groups have pointed to discriminatory inheritance laws as an area that must also be reformed if bangladeshi women are ever to experience a significant shift in status .
fundamental reforms may be needed for real change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv editor bilkis nahar says even though a woman , sheikh hasina , has bangladesh 's top job , ordinary women still face discrimination islamic law in the majority muslim nation dictates that a daughter inherit only half as much as her brothers , and women are unlikely to claim their share of family property unless it is offered to them .
" this situation is actually hampering the inner power of women to be empowered , " nahar said .
nahar says that programs in which women are given access to an income or assets fail to address more fundamental structures in bangladesh society that are halting progress in empowering women .
" a very small percentage of women is working at a decision-making level .
so it means that they 're not enjoying a lot of freedom in their workplaces , or in their home , in their school or others , because of -lsb- the -rsb- male-dominated society , and the mentality and social structure of that country , " she said .
but back in hasne 's village in sirajganj there are some promising signs that those shifts are already starting to take place .
men and children are crowding around the track hasne and the other women are working on .
one of the men , saiful islam , says he and the other villagers have more respect for the women now that they 're earning their own money .
as a matter of fact , the 38-year-old rickshaw-puller says , he would n't mind trading places with them .
