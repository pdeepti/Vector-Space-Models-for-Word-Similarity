thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .

analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .

dw-akademie has been training peace journalists there . congo is turning fifty .
many international media outlets are marking the anniversary by reporting on the state of this crisis-ravaged country in central africa .
“ in congo itself there are a number of celebrations ordered by those from higher up , but the local journalists are currently preoccupied with issues other than independence , ” says michael tecklenburg .
he has just returned from bukavu , the provincial capital of south kivu , which has been in crisis for years .
the situation there is a far cry from peaceful coexistence .
“ independence alone is not enough , ” says tecklenburg .
he is a dw-akademie media trainer and in june he ran the second part of a workshop on conflict-sensitive journalism .
twenty radio journalists and technicians took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the first week , the journalists practiced various journalistic conventions and radio formats , including how to conduct an interview and edit it sensitively .
the technicians focused on improving the sound quality of their recordings .
this way the comprehensibility of their reports was improved in both editorial and technical terms .
the second week was spent producing listener-oriented reports .
“ a team drove out of bukavu to a rural area at four in the morning to accompany women on their 30 kilometer trek from the village to the town market , ” reports tecklenburg .
the female reporters then had four hours to talk to the market women about their worries and everyday problems .
they learned of tensions not just between ethnic groups , but also between the sexes .
tecklenburg believes a report of this nature can raise people ’ s awareness of the conflict “ by showing clearly the difficult conditions under which women live in congo . ”
the situation in bukavu and the entire province of south kivu remains difficult to assess .
“ chaos and lawlessness are the order of the day , ” says tecklenburg , “ but blaming the many conflicts on ethnic differences is too easy .
yet , he says , that is what journalists often do .
tecklenburg says the reporting is often one-sided and prejudiced .
he says dw-akademie aims to show people alternatives with this project .
a ‘ club of conflict-sensitive journalists ’ now exists since the first workshop in congo was held in 2008 .
“ the journalists and broadcasters involved regularly produce a half-hour magazine program together , broadcast once a month on the eight radio stations in bukavu which have signed up .
this helps minimize conflicts and sensitizes people to them , ” says tecklenburg .
it is important to stress what people have in common in a climate where differences can quickly lead to conflicts , he adds .
“ that is exactly what the radio stations are doing with their magazine program . ”
this long-term project is to be continued in the coming year – this time on an international scale : “ in future we ’ ll be inviting journalists from the democratic republic of the congo , burundi and rwanda and offer training courses in all three countries . ”

the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .
fight ahead in parliament member states , which are represented in the council of the european union , the effective upper legislative body , are now to debate the budget proposals with the european parliament .
" it is not our intention to redo our numbers , " patrizio fiorilli , spokesman for eu budget chief janusz lewandowski , told news agency agence france-presse . instead the commission would hope to win over european legislators in a 21-day reconciliation process to begin on october 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament is next to debate the budget lewandowski has been under heavy pressure from cash-strapped member states to present a more thrifty version of the eu budget , which many euroskeptics see as little more than a black hole of bureaucracy .
his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .
fight ahead in parliament member states , which are represented in the council of the european union , the effective upper legislative body , are now to debate the budget proposals with the european parliament .
" it is not our intention to redo our numbers , " patrizio fiorilli , spokesman for eu budget chief janusz lewandowski , told news agency agence france-presse . instead the commission would hope to win over european legislators in a 21-day reconciliation process to begin on october 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament is next to debate the budget lewandowski has been under heavy pressure from cash-strapped member states to present a more thrifty version of the eu budget , which many euroskeptics see as little more than a black hole of bureaucracy .
his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

it has also threatened sanctions against the uk-based carrier .
" easyjet can not hide behind safety regulations for refusing to board passengers who have difficulty moving around , " the french transport ministry said in a statement .
" it must implement solutions adapted to each case , as most companies do .
otherwise it must be sanctioned with the greatest severity . "
the ministry also said that other airlines had already found appropriate solutions .
one of the affected passengers had lodged a complaint with the french anti-discrimination watchdog halde , which has criticized the fact that there is no official regulation on how to deal with disabled passengers .
safety concerns a spokeswoman for easyjet told the french news agency afp that the airline " was already in discussion with the french government to find a solution that is suitable for our passengers without compromising their security . "
the announcement by the french transport ministry comes after three separate incidents , in which paraplegic passengers were not allowed on the plane unaccompanied .
the reason given by the airline was that those passengers can not move without assistance .
easyjet says it is worried about safety , as regulations oblige it to be able to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds .
the airline says it is authorized to ask someone to accompany those who need assistance .
in one case , however , the carrier refused to let the disabled passenger on board despite a fellow passenger offering to assist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.08.2010 german economy eclipses growth forecasts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the low exchange rate may have helped boost exports official figures released friday show germany 's largest single-quarter economic growth since reunification in 1990 .
the economic revival , far better than expected , is based largely on a rise in exports . germany 's economy grew at a greater rate than forecast in the second quarter of 2010 , with gross domestic product 2.2 percent higher than during the first three months of the year . in comparison with the same time last year , germany 's economy grew by 4.1 percent for the period between april and june according to information released by the federal statistical office on friday . " reunified germany has never seen such quarterly growth before , " the office said in a statement .
analysts had forecast a growth rate of around 1.3 percent during the second quarter . exports surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle had high hopes for the year as a whole germany 's economic revival has been based largely on exports ; the country is the world 's second biggest exporter after china .
but the statistics agency also reported that household consumption and government expenditure contributed to the unexpectedly rapid growth . economy minister rainer bruederle said he believed growth far exceeding two percent was possible for the whole of 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 13.08.2010 berlin finds its voice at the new speaker 's corner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is no longer the only european capital with a speaker 's corner .
a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 13.08.2010 america taking risks , germany taking heed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy continued to shed jobs in july , generating fears of another downturn in the united states , the dream of perpetually rising living standards has bottomed out in growing unemployment .
across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 13.08.2010 america taking risks , germany taking heed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy continued to shed jobs in july , generating fears of another downturn in the united states , the dream of perpetually rising living standards has bottomed out in growing unemployment .
across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .

" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "
the wrong time for a catastrophe care and other aid organizations believe the lack of donations to pakistan also has to do with the timing of the disaster .
bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 13.08.2010 german military cuts to ' put effective end to conscription ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of volunteers would fall to 7,500 the government is reported to be planning to slash military spending , putting an effective end to the institution of mandatory military service .
if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 13.08.2010 coltan mines to be ' fingerprinted , ' german scientists say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantalum is exctracted from coltan ore researchers say they have come up with a new way to prove where coltan samples came from .
that could allow companies and refineries to purchase african coltan knowing that it did not come from a conflict area . in the late 1990s and early 2000s the world began to wake up to the reality of " blood diamonds , " or diamonds mined in regions of sub-saharan africa used to fund violent conflicts , especially in liberia , angola and sierra leone . but over the last decade , activists , scientists , and politicians have also been made increasingly aware of the use of coltan mining to fund similar conflicts central africa , especially in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . in 2009 , german mineral authorities said that africa produced half of the world 's coltan , significantly up from previous years as major mines in canada and australia were shut down due to coltan 's falling price .
the metallic ore contains tantalum , a key element in the production of semi-conductors and capacitors found in nearly every consumer electronic device , including ipods , mobile phones and video game consoles . a study released in may by the london-based resource consulting services -lrb- rcs -rrb- said that in 2009 , a group of hutu rebels in rwanda , the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda , were 75 percent funded by the sale of minerals like coltan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region in eastern congo contain important deposit of coltan but governments worldwide are starting to take action .
us president barack obama recently signed into law a provision requiring more transparency in the mineral mining sector .
the european union does not currently have any similar provisions . the american law will require companies sourcing coltan from the drc and its nine neighboring countries , including rwanda , to prove that their mineral exports are conflict-free .
some development activists have said that while this is a positive development , turning the new law into an effective embargo may be a nearly impossible task . but in recent years , german scientists have said that they have found a method of chemical analysis to determine which coltan samples are conflict-free .
they said each coltan sample from a particular mine has a given " fingerprint , " or unique set of characteristics . ' it 's a totally different mineralogy ' from his office at the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover , frank melcher has a collection of rock cuttings in small see-through boxes and plastic bags spread out .
next to each box and bag he puts a color print-out of pictures taken with an electron microscope .
to the untrained eye they look like pictures of mosaic floor , but for melcher they indicate far more . " if you compare coltan samples from different proveniences , it 's quite obvious , " he said .
" this is a sample from rwanda , this one 's from australia .
the dye distribution is totally different .
it 's a totally different mineralogy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melcher examines the origin of coltan melcher is one of many german scientists working to set up a " certified trading chain , " which would establish the origin of coltan samples . he relies on more than using visual cues to identify a coltan sample 's provenance .
melcher and his colleagues also use an electron microprobe that hits the sample with an electron beam .
the emerging x-rays indicate which chemical elements are contained in the sample . " i can see right away what elements are contained in this sample and how much of them , " he said .
" here it 's tantalum , there it 's niobium , manganese , iron and i spot some titanium as well . " german government scientists are using this technique to register the fingerprints of legitimate mines that then could be compared to field samples mined in the future .
the idea would be to provide incontrovertible evidence showing that a sample of coltan was mined in a conflict-free zone .
melcher said he has reference samples from 75 percent of the world 's coltan mines . " we hope that one day only truly clean products leave african soil , " he said . " in connection with environmental and social standards this could be the way to go for raw materials , " he added .
" we want a trading chain with european and american companies purchasing goods directly from the african market .
this is impossible for them at the moment . " however , samples from mines in china and the drc comprise the remaining 25 percent , he added . " the chinese are n't interested in delivering samples , and drc is impossible to access , " he said . european refineries stand to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german process could limit coltan mining to conflict-free regions some german companies have already been affected by the shadiness of the coltan trade .
h.c. starck , based in the central german city of goslar , has one of the many refineries around europe that takes coltan ore and refines it into pure tantalum . h.c. starck is one of the few companies capable of completing the complex process of making tiny , reliable and heat-resistant capacitors out of tantalum .
but 10 years ago the united nations accused the company of using tantalum from war-torn regions of congo and h.c. starck 's reputation suffered significantly . after the accusations became public , the company began cooperating with the united nations and re-evaluated its coltan acquisition process .
starck now does not purchase any tantalum from africa . " while working through everything together with the un panel , we found out , that not every retailer had told us the truth concerning the material 's origin - despite assuring otherwise , " said manfred buetefisch , a company spokesperson .
" that 's when we realized that - seeing the ongoing war in east africa and the drc - that they are not reliable partners for us , and that we can not buy any material there anymore . " companies like h.c. stark are now banking on being able to rely more and more on african coltan .
the company already bought a nrd rwanda , a small mining company in rwanda .
soon , every one of its deliveries will be certified by the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover . rock cuttings for the license have already been already charted and included in frank melcher 's database .
by taking random control samples the geologist can now verify whether coltan was taken from the company 's mine in rwanda . " this is of course an ideal case : a company investing in the local mining industry , importing the coltan on its own and making sure that it is no illegally mined material infecting the trading chain , " melcher said . certification is slow moving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coltan is often separated from other rocks by hand one year ago the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources invited all 10 rwandan mining companies for a certification workshop .
the companies ' chief executives were reserved in the beginning but four companies joined nrd rwanda and have signed up for the testing procedures . industry analysts have said that the new practice may pressure african coltan-exporting countries to clean up their mining practices on their own , without relying on harsher external policies . " this might limit corruption , violence and other conflicts fought over coltan and other resources , " said peter eigen of the ngo transparency international .
" once the companies voluntarily agree to cooperate , it 's easier to make a point rather than trying to boycott these raw materials or subject them to certain conditions . " but first , the hannover geologists have to adapt their methods to the industry in the congo .
and they all know that it 's a far cry from the way things work in rwanda to the unstable situation in the democratic republic of the congo . while german scientists say getting congo and china to adopt their methods will be difficult , they said they are confident their process change coltan mining in the long term .
while they are willing to provide the fingerprinting system , they say that the certification chain must be located in africa to be most effective , and that its implementation remains a local political issue . " there will be a big meeting in nairobi before the end of the year for certification procedures , " melcher said . " we hope that fingerprinting will be part of the measures that they take .

across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .

kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 13.08.2010 insurers face mounting catastrophe claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurers began counting the costs of disasters early in the year 2010 is proving a rather expensive year for insurers , as claims mount amid a growing number of natural disasters around the world .
the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.08.2010 reconstruction of stuttgart railway station begins amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally calm stuttgart has been rife with protest dismantling of stuttgart 's main rail station has begun amid protests against the controversial " stuttgart 21 " construction project .
thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

it has also threatened sanctions against the uk-based carrier .
" easyjet can not hide behind safety regulations for refusing to board passengers who have difficulty moving around , " the french transport ministry said in a statement .
" it must implement solutions adapted to each case , as most companies do .
otherwise it must be sanctioned with the greatest severity . "
the ministry also said that other airlines had already found appropriate solutions .
one of the affected passengers had lodged a complaint with the french anti-discrimination watchdog halde , which has criticized the fact that there is no official regulation on how to deal with disabled passengers .
safety concerns a spokeswoman for easyjet told the french news agency afp that the airline " was already in discussion with the french government to find a solution that is suitable for our passengers without compromising their security . "
the announcement by the french transport ministry comes after three separate incidents , in which paraplegic passengers were not allowed on the plane unaccompanied .
the reason given by the airline was that those passengers can not move without assistance .
easyjet says it is worried about safety , as regulations oblige it to be able to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds .
the airline says it is authorized to ask someone to accompany those who need assistance .
in one case , however , the carrier refused to let the disabled passenger on board despite a fellow passenger offering to assist .

" at the moment we are experiencing ' extra large ' growth , " said bruederle . exports have been bolstered by demand from china and other emerging economies .
the hamburg harbor logistics firm hhlaa noticed an increase in container freight traffic of 20 percent over the period , due to the rise in exports . weak euro , more contracts one reason german manufacturers are winning export sales could be that the euro is being kept low by concerns about weaker mediterranean partners .

in northern punjab , victims wonder if they have been forgotten . the car moves slowly across a rickety bridge that crosses the indus river and has miraculously survived the floods .
there is brown muddy water raging on either side .
kalabagh , just on the other side of the bridge a hundred meters away , looks idyllic from a distance , with its mountainous panorama . however , the closer one gets , the more apparent is the devastation .
as it swelled up with heavy rain , the indus swept away everything in its path .
whole houses were destroyed .
it is impossible to calculate how many people died . a huge lake of mud where there used to be fields , there is just one huge lake of mud now .
the only road is completely blocked .
one of the local farmers mohammad taiz is trying to clear a path but this seems to be a sisyphean task .
" the water keeps coming back , " he says .
" every two days , it rains heavily and we have to start all over again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages are under water mr taiz says that although cars are able to cross the bridge , he has seen no delivery of relief supplies .
he wonders if he and the other survivors have been " forgotten " . hussein imdad , another farmer from the village , feels the same .
at first , he was able to keep his home intact by digging mud away .
however , " it kept getting worse and the rain rose suddenly .
it came up to our necks and we had to flee .
there were no boats so i took the children by their hands .

mr amin says that there has been no sign of international relief .
local government officials and ngos have delivered some fresh water , flour and wheat but not enough and not regularly . islamabad is five hours away .

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .
donors worry funds will fall into the wrong hands sandra bulling of care deutschland-luxemburg told deutsche welle that pakistan 's reputation for corruption and supporting islamist terrorists scared many potential donors .

what they hear in the media is that the pakistani government might be corrupt , that money will vanish down government channels , " bulling said .
" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "
the wrong time for a catastrophe care and other aid organizations believe the lack of donations to pakistan also has to do with the timing of the disaster .
bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .
not only are many germans now away on summer holiday - away from the media and their bank accounts - but many are afflicted by " donor fatigue , " according to svenja koch of the red cross .
" we 've had a summer of catastrophes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods have displaced an estimated 13 million people 6 million need relief to survive the un has warned that the disaster is far from over and that dams in the southern sindh province could burst in coming days , leading to further flooding .
so far , islamabad has confirmed 1,343 deaths , with over 1,000 in the northwestern khyber-pakhtunkhwa province alone .
the un estimates a death toll of over 1,600 .
pakistan says that between 15 and 20 million residents have been affected by the floods .
the un estimates that 6 million people will be dependent on relief aid for survival , many of whom have been cut off by flooded roads and collapsed bridges according to oxfam germany chief ralf bendix , the relatively low number of causalities in pakistan can be dangerously misleading to potential donors given the precarious position of millions of survivors .
" in the other disasters one hundred thousand died immediately .
obviously it 's easier to mobilize the attention of the public and the government when there 's a high number of casualities than it is when you tell them there will be many more deaths if nothing is done , " he said .
pakistan slowly moving to action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief supplies are running out the pakistani government friday announced plans to intensify its own rescue and aid efforts for flood victims .
after visiting affected regions , prime minister yousuf raza gilani said " the extent of total damage to life , property , cattle head and infrastructure may be far more than what the initial estimates suggested . "
the premier and president asif ali zardari - who has come under massive criticism for making two european trips during the disaster - agreed that " a massive mobilization of resources including budgetary re-prioritization may be required , " according to a statement from the presidential palace .

unsurprisingly , several mentioned that certain friday that comes around one to three times a year . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . friday the 13th and other superstitions at home in germany , a lot of people do n't like friday the 13th or when a black cat crosses in front of them from left to right .
i never paid attention to that stuff - even friday the 13th is usually a good day for me , and i love black cats -lrb- even though they usually die on me or disappear -rrb- . - evelin via facebook when i spill salt , i throw some over my shoulder for good luck , and i will only pick up a lost penny if it is heads up - otherwise it may bring bad luck . - laura , usa if your left hand itches , you will receive some money soon .
if your right hand itches , you will meet somebody you know very soon . - irena via facebook if a rooster sings at the front door , you should expect guests .
if you drop a fork or knife , then you should expect some hungry guests .
if you go on a trip , you should n't end it in a quarrel with someone .
do n't go back for something you 've forgotten , or you 'll get into trouble . - olga , netherlands in batangas , philippines or maybe anywhere else in the tagalog region , there are many superstitions which get taken seriously .
popular ones are : 1 .
" sweeping the floor at night and pushing it out of the doorway is bad luck . "
that 's like putting all the goods you get during the day to waste .
you have to sweep in the morning .
2 .
" no two siblings should ever get married on the same year , no matter what . "
doing so is like stealing the luck from each other .
we still have many , and it does n't mean we are backwards .
they stem from folktales and the experiences of our forefathers . - joel , philippines mexico : " when the crow sings , the indian dies .
-lrb- cuando el cuervo canta el indio muere . -rrb- " - marco via facebook friday the 13th .
my mom will not leave the house whenever it is friday the 13th . - brenda , usa where i presently reside - the philippines - the people are a superstitious lot with an innumerable list of superstitions .
as for yours truly , since i just pay mind to the eternal one and what he has to say , i would n't know which are the most ' popular ' for they 're all unimportant to this lady and not in any way credible enough to waste her time with . - ginna , philippines compiled by greg wiser editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 13.08.2010 america taking risks , germany taking heed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy continued to shed jobs in july , generating fears of another downturn in the united states , the dream of perpetually rising living standards has bottomed out in growing unemployment .
across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.08.2010 refugee camps to use gas from human waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three refugee camps in the world have inadequate sanitation facilities energy shortages and poor sanitation are two of the most serious problems in refugee camps .
now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in northern punjab , victims wonder if they have been forgotten . the car moves slowly across a rickety bridge that crosses the indus river and has miraculously survived the floods .
there is brown muddy water raging on either side .
kalabagh , just on the other side of the bridge a hundred meters away , looks idyllic from a distance , with its mountainous panorama . however , the closer one gets , the more apparent is the devastation .
as it swelled up with heavy rain , the indus swept away everything in its path .
whole houses were destroyed .
it is impossible to calculate how many people died . a huge lake of mud where there used to be fields , there is just one huge lake of mud now .
the only road is completely blocked .
one of the local farmers mohammad taiz is trying to clear a path but this seems to be a sisyphean task .
" the water keeps coming back , " he says .
" every two days , it rains heavily and we have to start all over again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages are under water mr taiz says that although cars are able to cross the bridge , he has seen no delivery of relief supplies .
he wonders if he and the other survivors have been " forgotten " . hussein imdad , another farmer from the village , feels the same .
at first , he was able to keep his home intact by digging mud away .
however , " it kept getting worse and the rain rose suddenly .
it came up to our necks and we had to flee .
there were no boats so i took the children by their hands .

dw-akademie has been training peace journalists there . congo is turning fifty .
many international media outlets are marking the anniversary by reporting on the state of this crisis-ravaged country in central africa .
“ in congo itself there are a number of celebrations ordered by those from higher up , but the local journalists are currently preoccupied with issues other than independence , ” says michael tecklenburg .
he has just returned from bukavu , the provincial capital of south kivu , which has been in crisis for years .
the situation there is a far cry from peaceful coexistence .
“ independence alone is not enough , ” says tecklenburg .
he is a dw-akademie media trainer and in june he ran the second part of a workshop on conflict-sensitive journalism .
twenty radio journalists and technicians took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the first week , the journalists practiced various journalistic conventions and radio formats , including how to conduct an interview and edit it sensitively .
the technicians focused on improving the sound quality of their recordings .
this way the comprehensibility of their reports was improved in both editorial and technical terms .
the second week was spent producing listener-oriented reports .
“ a team drove out of bukavu to a rural area at four in the morning to accompany women on their 30 kilometer trek from the village to the town market , ” reports tecklenburg .
the female reporters then had four hours to talk to the market women about their worries and everyday problems .
they learned of tensions not just between ethnic groups , but also between the sexes .
tecklenburg believes a report of this nature can raise people ’ s awareness of the conflict “ by showing clearly the difficult conditions under which women live in congo . ”
the situation in bukavu and the entire province of south kivu remains difficult to assess .
“ chaos and lawlessness are the order of the day , ” says tecklenburg , “ but blaming the many conflicts on ethnic differences is too easy .
yet , he says , that is what journalists often do .
tecklenburg says the reporting is often one-sided and prejudiced .
he says dw-akademie aims to show people alternatives with this project .
a ‘ club of conflict-sensitive journalists ’ now exists since the first workshop in congo was held in 2008 .
“ the journalists and broadcasters involved regularly produce a half-hour magazine program together , broadcast once a month on the eight radio stations in bukavu which have signed up .
this helps minimize conflicts and sensitizes people to them , ” says tecklenburg .
it is important to stress what people have in common in a climate where differences can quickly lead to conflicts , he adds .
“ that is exactly what the radio stations are doing with their magazine program . ”

eight so-called " right-to-information " activists have been killed in a year . last month , amit jethwa , a prominent environmentalist and information warrior , was shot dead by two unidentified gunmen just opposite the gujarat high court in the western city of ahmedabad . just a few days earlier , he had filed a public interest petition at the same court .
the petition named a prominent politician as one of the many interested parties involved in illegal mining activities in the protected gir forest . another activist , satish shetty , was killed by unidentified men earlier this year .
he had shot to fame after exposing certain corrupt land deals related to the country 's first expressway from mumbai to pune . eight deaths , 20 serious attacks in total , there have been eight deaths and over 20 serious attacks in the past year alone .
they have brought into sharp focus the obstacles hindering the successful implementation of india 's landmark right to information act that is supposed to expose corruption in the government and came into existence in october 2005 . the national transparency watchdog , the central information commission -lrb- cic -rrb- , admitted that there was cause for concern . " the rti act is now beginning to bite , " said wajahat habibullah , the chief information commissioner .
" it had a bite earlier but it is now beginning to bite into vested interests also .
and the vested interests will spare no effort and have no compunction in using excessive measures to try and crush activism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wajahat habibullah , the chief information commissioner of india before the law was passed , citizens and activists found it difficult to obtain information from federal and state authorities . powerful tool for exposing corruption in its five years of existence , the right to information act has become a powerful tool that has been used to expose the connections between corrupt officials , politicians and even the mafia . sensitive information , which the bureaucrats and political establishment would prefer kept outside the public domain so as to protect their own interests , has started coming out . so there has been a backlash , says shekhar singh , the convener of the national council for people 's right to information or ncpri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists say they need to work collectively to avoid being targeted individually " it is of course sad and unfortunate but also inevitable because once you have a law as powerful as the rti , it is only worthwhile if it ruffles vested interests , " he said .
" vested interests have a history not only in this country but the world over of fighting back .
so what we have to do is build up strategies which protect our activists . " activists need to work together vinita singh , who has made use of the right to information act in mumbai and delhi , said that there needed to be solidarity between activists who should work together if they were to avoid life-threatening situations . " rti activism is often done at an individual level , you get information , try to figure out what to do with it .
we work as lonesome information warriors .
we need networks , we need to act collectively or at least find people who are related to it .
i think the more we do that , the better are our chances of making an impact and also working in a way that will not harm individual people . " individuals have been using the right of information act as a weapon to expose corruption .
however , the government does not seem to be fulfilling its part of the deal , which is to bring culprits to book or give protection to whistleblowers . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .

" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "

bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 13.08.2010 coltan mines to be ' fingerprinted , ' german scientists say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantalum is exctracted from coltan ore researchers say they have come up with a new way to prove where coltan samples came from .
that could allow companies and refineries to purchase african coltan knowing that it did not come from a conflict area . in the late 1990s and early 2000s the world began to wake up to the reality of " blood diamonds , " or diamonds mined in regions of sub-saharan africa used to fund violent conflicts , especially in liberia , angola and sierra leone . but over the last decade , activists , scientists , and politicians have also been made increasingly aware of the use of coltan mining to fund similar conflicts central africa , especially in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . in 2009 , german mineral authorities said that africa produced half of the world 's coltan , significantly up from previous years as major mines in canada and australia were shut down due to coltan 's falling price .
the metallic ore contains tantalum , a key element in the production of semi-conductors and capacitors found in nearly every consumer electronic device , including ipods , mobile phones and video game consoles . a study released in may by the london-based resource consulting services -lrb- rcs -rrb- said that in 2009 , a group of hutu rebels in rwanda , the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda , were 75 percent funded by the sale of minerals like coltan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region in eastern congo contain important deposit of coltan but governments worldwide are starting to take action .
us president barack obama recently signed into law a provision requiring more transparency in the mineral mining sector .
the european union does not currently have any similar provisions . the american law will require companies sourcing coltan from the drc and its nine neighboring countries , including rwanda , to prove that their mineral exports are conflict-free .
some development activists have said that while this is a positive development , turning the new law into an effective embargo may be a nearly impossible task . but in recent years , german scientists have said that they have found a method of chemical analysis to determine which coltan samples are conflict-free .
they said each coltan sample from a particular mine has a given " fingerprint , " or unique set of characteristics . ' it 's a totally different mineralogy ' from his office at the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover , frank melcher has a collection of rock cuttings in small see-through boxes and plastic bags spread out .
next to each box and bag he puts a color print-out of pictures taken with an electron microscope .
to the untrained eye they look like pictures of mosaic floor , but for melcher they indicate far more . " if you compare coltan samples from different proveniences , it 's quite obvious , " he said .
" this is a sample from rwanda , this one 's from australia .
the dye distribution is totally different .
it 's a totally different mineralogy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melcher examines the origin of coltan melcher is one of many german scientists working to set up a " certified trading chain , " which would establish the origin of coltan samples . he relies on more than using visual cues to identify a coltan sample 's provenance .
melcher and his colleagues also use an electron microprobe that hits the sample with an electron beam .
the emerging x-rays indicate which chemical elements are contained in the sample . " i can see right away what elements are contained in this sample and how much of them , " he said .
" here it 's tantalum , there it 's niobium , manganese , iron and i spot some titanium as well . " german government scientists are using this technique to register the fingerprints of legitimate mines that then could be compared to field samples mined in the future .
the idea would be to provide incontrovertible evidence showing that a sample of coltan was mined in a conflict-free zone .
melcher said he has reference samples from 75 percent of the world 's coltan mines . " we hope that one day only truly clean products leave african soil , " he said . " in connection with environmental and social standards this could be the way to go for raw materials , " he added .
" we want a trading chain with european and american companies purchasing goods directly from the african market .
this is impossible for them at the moment . " however , samples from mines in china and the drc comprise the remaining 25 percent , he added . " the chinese are n't interested in delivering samples , and drc is impossible to access , " he said . european refineries stand to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german process could limit coltan mining to conflict-free regions some german companies have already been affected by the shadiness of the coltan trade .
h.c. starck , based in the central german city of goslar , has one of the many refineries around europe that takes coltan ore and refines it into pure tantalum . h.c. starck is one of the few companies capable of completing the complex process of making tiny , reliable and heat-resistant capacitors out of tantalum .
but 10 years ago the united nations accused the company of using tantalum from war-torn regions of congo and h.c. starck 's reputation suffered significantly . after the accusations became public , the company began cooperating with the united nations and re-evaluated its coltan acquisition process .
starck now does not purchase any tantalum from africa . " while working through everything together with the un panel , we found out , that not every retailer had told us the truth concerning the material 's origin - despite assuring otherwise , " said manfred buetefisch , a company spokesperson .
" that 's when we realized that - seeing the ongoing war in east africa and the drc - that they are not reliable partners for us , and that we can not buy any material there anymore . " companies like h.c. stark are now banking on being able to rely more and more on african coltan .
the company already bought a nrd rwanda , a small mining company in rwanda .
soon , every one of its deliveries will be certified by the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover . rock cuttings for the license have already been already charted and included in frank melcher 's database .
by taking random control samples the geologist can now verify whether coltan was taken from the company 's mine in rwanda . " this is of course an ideal case : a company investing in the local mining industry , importing the coltan on its own and making sure that it is no illegally mined material infecting the trading chain , " melcher said . certification is slow moving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coltan is often separated from other rocks by hand one year ago the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources invited all 10 rwandan mining companies for a certification workshop .
the companies ' chief executives were reserved in the beginning but four companies joined nrd rwanda and have signed up for the testing procedures . industry analysts have said that the new practice may pressure african coltan-exporting countries to clean up their mining practices on their own , without relying on harsher external policies . " this might limit corruption , violence and other conflicts fought over coltan and other resources , " said peter eigen of the ngo transparency international .
" once the companies voluntarily agree to cooperate , it 's easier to make a point rather than trying to boycott these raw materials or subject them to certain conditions . " but first , the hannover geologists have to adapt their methods to the industry in the congo .
and they all know that it 's a far cry from the way things work in rwanda to the unstable situation in the democratic republic of the congo . while german scientists say getting congo and china to adopt their methods will be difficult , they said they are confident their process change coltan mining in the long term .
while they are willing to provide the fingerprinting system , they say that the certification chain must be located in africa to be most effective , and that its implementation remains a local political issue . " there will be a big meeting in nairobi before the end of the year for certification procedures , " melcher said . " we hope that fingerprinting will be part of the measures that they take .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.08.2010 refugee camps to use gas from human waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three refugee camps in the world have inadequate sanitation facilities energy shortages and poor sanitation are two of the most serious problems in refugee camps .
now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 13.08.2010 donations in germany frighteningly low as pakistan relief grows critical großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans donors may not be aware how dire the need is with 6 million lives on the line in pakistan , german relief organizations are struggling to find private donations .
they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .
donors worry funds will fall into the wrong hands sandra bulling of care deutschland-luxemburg told deutsche welle that pakistan 's reputation for corruption and supporting islamist terrorists scared many potential donors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions are inaccessible to aid workers " we have received calls from private donors who asked us if the money they donate will reach the people in need and wo n't go to the government .
what they hear in the media is that the pakistani government might be corrupt , that money will vanish down government channels , " bulling said .
" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "
the wrong time for a catastrophe care and other aid organizations believe the lack of donations to pakistan also has to do with the timing of the disaster .
bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .
not only are many germans now away on summer holiday - away from the media and their bank accounts - but many are afflicted by " donor fatigue , " according to svenja koch of the red cross .
" we 've had a summer of catastrophes .
from the oil-soaked pelicans in the gulf of mexico to the love parade tragedy to the floods in saxony to the wildfires in russia , " koch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods have displaced an estimated 13 million people 6 million need relief to survive the un has warned that the disaster is far from over and that dams in the southern sindh province could burst in coming days , leading to further flooding .
so far , islamabad has confirmed 1,343 deaths , with over 1,000 in the northwestern khyber-pakhtunkhwa province alone .
the un estimates a death toll of over 1,600 .
pakistan says that between 15 and 20 million residents have been affected by the floods .
the un estimates that 6 million people will be dependent on relief aid for survival , many of whom have been cut off by flooded roads and collapsed bridges according to oxfam germany chief ralf bendix , the relatively low number of causalities in pakistan can be dangerously misleading to potential donors given the precarious position of millions of survivors .
" in the other disasters one hundred thousand died immediately .
obviously it 's easier to mobilize the attention of the public and the government when there 's a high number of casualities than it is when you tell them there will be many more deaths if nothing is done , " he said .
pakistan slowly moving to action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief supplies are running out the pakistani government friday announced plans to intensify its own rescue and aid efforts for flood victims .
after visiting affected regions , prime minister yousuf raza gilani said " the extent of total damage to life , property , cattle head and infrastructure may be far more than what the initial estimates suggested . "
the premier and president asif ali zardari - who has come under massive criticism for making two european trips during the disaster - agreed that " a massive mobilization of resources including budgetary re-prioritization may be required , " according to a statement from the presidential palace .

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .
donors worry funds will fall into the wrong hands sandra bulling of care deutschland-luxemburg told deutsche welle that pakistan 's reputation for corruption and supporting islamist terrorists scared many potential donors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions are inaccessible to aid workers " we have received calls from private donors who asked us if the money they donate will reach the people in need and wo n't go to the government .
what they hear in the media is that the pakistani government might be corrupt , that money will vanish down government channels , " bulling said .
" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "
the wrong time for a catastrophe care and other aid organizations believe the lack of donations to pakistan also has to do with the timing of the disaster .
bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .
not only are many germans now away on summer holiday - away from the media and their bank accounts - but many are afflicted by " donor fatigue , " according to svenja koch of the red cross .
" we 've had a summer of catastrophes .
from the oil-soaked pelicans in the gulf of mexico to the love parade tragedy to the floods in saxony to the wildfires in russia , " koch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods have displaced an estimated 13 million people 6 million need relief to survive the un has warned that the disaster is far from over and that dams in the southern sindh province could burst in coming days , leading to further flooding .
so far , islamabad has confirmed 1,343 deaths , with over 1,000 in the northwestern khyber-pakhtunkhwa province alone .
the un estimates a death toll of over 1,600 .
pakistan says that between 15 and 20 million residents have been affected by the floods .
the un estimates that 6 million people will be dependent on relief aid for survival , many of whom have been cut off by flooded roads and collapsed bridges according to oxfam germany chief ralf bendix , the relatively low number of causalities in pakistan can be dangerously misleading to potential donors given the precarious position of millions of survivors .
" in the other disasters one hundred thousand died immediately .
obviously it 's easier to mobilize the attention of the public and the government when there 's a high number of casualities than it is when you tell them there will be many more deaths if nothing is done , " he said .
pakistan slowly moving to action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief supplies are running out the pakistani government friday announced plans to intensify its own rescue and aid efforts for flood victims .
after visiting affected regions , prime minister yousuf raza gilani said " the extent of total damage to life , property , cattle head and infrastructure may be far more than what the initial estimates suggested . "
the premier and president asif ali zardari - who has come under massive criticism for making two european trips during the disaster - agreed that " a massive mobilization of resources including budgetary re-prioritization may be required , " according to a statement from the presidential palace .

trade unionists have strongly condemned the verdict . a hanover court has approved a planned neo-nazi march in a town in the state of lower saxony this weekend , but prohibited a trade union counter-demonstration from taking place .
right-wing extremists will hold a " funeral march " on saturday in bad nenndorf , where british occupying forces interrogated nazis between 1945 and 1947 , and reportedly abused their detainees .
the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- was planning to march in opposition , and described the administrative court 's decision to stop them as an " incredible ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : counter-demos against neo-nazis are common in germany " a very sad day for civil society , " said a statement from the dgb .
" but also a further incentive for us to proceed yet further against right-wing extremism . "
threat to public order the court decided in favor of the neo-nazi march , as it was organized first and was judged to present less of a threat to public order .
around 1,000 nazi sympathizers are expected , while the dgb said it was expecting up to 2,000 participants .
the large number of participants for both sides caused the schaumburg district court to originally block both demonstrations .
district official ursula mueller-kratz explained that the decision was made because an adequate number of police were not available to ensure safety .
but the hanover administrative court ruled on thursday that a police presence of around 2,000 officers was sufficient to oversee one demonstration .
neo-nazi forces have been commemorating the mistreatment of prisoners in bad nenndorf since 2006 , with the annual events increasing in popularity every year .

trade unionists have strongly condemned the verdict . a hanover court has approved a planned neo-nazi march in a town in the state of lower saxony this weekend , but prohibited a trade union counter-demonstration from taking place .
right-wing extremists will hold a " funeral march " on saturday in bad nenndorf , where british occupying forces interrogated nazis between 1945 and 1947 , and reportedly abused their detainees .
the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- was planning to march in opposition , and described the administrative court 's decision to stop them as an " incredible ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : counter-demos against neo-nazis are common in germany " a very sad day for civil society , " said a statement from the dgb .
" but also a further incentive for us to proceed yet further against right-wing extremism . "
threat to public order the court decided in favor of the neo-nazi march , as it was organized first and was judged to present less of a threat to public order .
around 1,000 nazi sympathizers are expected , while the dgb said it was expecting up to 2,000 participants .
the large number of participants for both sides caused the schaumburg district court to originally block both demonstrations .
district official ursula mueller-kratz explained that the decision was made because an adequate number of police were not available to ensure safety .
but the hanover administrative court ruled on thursday that a police presence of around 2,000 officers was sufficient to oversee one demonstration .
neo-nazi forces have been commemorating the mistreatment of prisoners in bad nenndorf since 2006 , with the annual events increasing in popularity every year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.08.2010 refugee camps to use gas from human waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three refugee camps in the world have inadequate sanitation facilities energy shortages and poor sanitation are two of the most serious problems in refugee camps .
now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .
fight ahead in parliament member states , which are represented in the council of the european union , the effective upper legislative body , are now to debate the budget proposals with the european parliament .
" it is not our intention to redo our numbers , " patrizio fiorilli , spokesman for eu budget chief janusz lewandowski , told news agency agence france-presse . instead the commission would hope to win over european legislators in a 21-day reconciliation process to begin on october 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament is next to debate the budget lewandowski has been under heavy pressure from cash-strapped member states to present a more thrifty version of the eu budget , which many euroskeptics see as little more than a black hole of bureaucracy .
his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .
fight ahead in parliament member states , which are represented in the council of the european union , the effective upper legislative body , are now to debate the budget proposals with the european parliament .
" it is not our intention to redo our numbers , " patrizio fiorilli , spokesman for eu budget chief janusz lewandowski , told news agency agence france-presse . instead the commission would hope to win over european legislators in a 21-day reconciliation process to begin on october 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament is next to debate the budget lewandowski has been under heavy pressure from cash-strapped member states to present a more thrifty version of the eu budget , which many euroskeptics see as little more than a black hole of bureaucracy .
his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

trade unionists have strongly condemned the verdict . a hanover court has approved a planned neo-nazi march in a town in the state of lower saxony this weekend , but prohibited a trade union counter-demonstration from taking place .
right-wing extremists will hold a " funeral march " on saturday in bad nenndorf , where british occupying forces interrogated nazis between 1945 and 1947 , and reportedly abused their detainees .
the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- was planning to march in opposition , and described the administrative court 's decision to stop them as an " incredible ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : counter-demos against neo-nazis are common in germany " a very sad day for civil society , " said a statement from the dgb .
" but also a further incentive for us to proceed yet further against right-wing extremism . "
threat to public order the court decided in favor of the neo-nazi march , as it was organized first and was judged to present less of a threat to public order .
around 1,000 nazi sympathizers are expected , while the dgb said it was expecting up to 2,000 participants .
the large number of participants for both sides caused the schaumburg district court to originally block both demonstrations .
district official ursula mueller-kratz explained that the decision was made because an adequate number of police were not available to ensure safety .
but the hanover administrative court ruled on thursday that a police presence of around 2,000 officers was sufficient to oversee one demonstration .
neo-nazi forces have been commemorating the mistreatment of prisoners in bad nenndorf since 2006 , with the annual events increasing in popularity every year .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .

" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 13.08.2010 insurers face mounting catastrophe claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurers began counting the costs of disasters early in the year 2010 is proving a rather expensive year for insurers , as claims mount amid a growing number of natural disasters around the world .
the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 13.08.2010 insurers face mounting catastrophe claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurers began counting the costs of disasters early in the year 2010 is proving a rather expensive year for insurers , as claims mount amid a growing number of natural disasters around the world .
the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .

that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .

despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .

while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .

while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.08.2010 refugee camps to use gas from human waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three refugee camps in the world have inadequate sanitation facilities energy shortages and poor sanitation are two of the most serious problems in refugee camps .
now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 13.08.2010 german military cuts to ' put effective end to conscription ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of volunteers would fall to 7,500 the government is reported to be planning to slash military spending , putting an effective end to the institution of mandatory military service .
if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .

gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .

we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .

schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

eight so-called " right-to-information " activists have been killed in a year . last month , amit jethwa , a prominent environmentalist and information warrior , was shot dead by two unidentified gunmen just opposite the gujarat high court in the western city of ahmedabad . just a few days earlier , he had filed a public interest petition at the same court .
the petition named a prominent politician as one of the many interested parties involved in illegal mining activities in the protected gir forest . another activist , satish shetty , was killed by unidentified men earlier this year .
he had shot to fame after exposing certain corrupt land deals related to the country 's first expressway from mumbai to pune . eight deaths , 20 serious attacks in total , there have been eight deaths and over 20 serious attacks in the past year alone .
they have brought into sharp focus the obstacles hindering the successful implementation of india 's landmark right to information act that is supposed to expose corruption in the government and came into existence in october 2005 . the national transparency watchdog , the central information commission -lrb- cic -rrb- , admitted that there was cause for concern . " the rti act is now beginning to bite , " said wajahat habibullah , the chief information commissioner .
" it had a bite earlier but it is now beginning to bite into vested interests also .
and the vested interests will spare no effort and have no compunction in using excessive measures to try and crush activism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wajahat habibullah , the chief information commissioner of india before the law was passed , citizens and activists found it difficult to obtain information from federal and state authorities . powerful tool for exposing corruption in its five years of existence , the right to information act has become a powerful tool that has been used to expose the connections between corrupt officials , politicians and even the mafia . sensitive information , which the bureaucrats and political establishment would prefer kept outside the public domain so as to protect their own interests , has started coming out . so there has been a backlash , says shekhar singh , the convener of the national council for people 's right to information or ncpri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists say they need to work collectively to avoid being targeted individually " it is of course sad and unfortunate but also inevitable because once you have a law as powerful as the rti , it is only worthwhile if it ruffles vested interests , " he said .
" vested interests have a history not only in this country but the world over of fighting back .
so what we have to do is build up strategies which protect our activists . " activists need to work together vinita singh , who has made use of the right to information act in mumbai and delhi , said that there needed to be solidarity between activists who should work together if they were to avoid life-threatening situations . " rti activism is often done at an individual level , you get information , try to figure out what to do with it .
we work as lonesome information warriors .
we need networks , we need to act collectively or at least find people who are related to it .
i think the more we do that , the better are our chances of making an impact and also working in a way that will not harm individual people . " individuals have been using the right of information act as a weapon to expose corruption .
however , the government does not seem to be fulfilling its part of the deal , which is to bring culprits to book or give protection to whistleblowers . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 13.08.2010 insurers face mounting catastrophe claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurers began counting the costs of disasters early in the year 2010 is proving a rather expensive year for insurers , as claims mount amid a growing number of natural disasters around the world .
the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 13.08.2010 america taking risks , germany taking heed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy continued to shed jobs in july , generating fears of another downturn in the united states , the dream of perpetually rising living standards has bottomed out in growing unemployment .
across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .

releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 13.08.2010 america taking risks , germany taking heed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy continued to shed jobs in july , generating fears of another downturn in the united states , the dream of perpetually rising living standards has bottomed out in growing unemployment .
across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .

his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .

trade unionists have strongly condemned the verdict . a hanover court has approved a planned neo-nazi march in a town in the state of lower saxony this weekend , but prohibited a trade union counter-demonstration from taking place .
right-wing extremists will hold a " funeral march " on saturday in bad nenndorf , where british occupying forces interrogated nazis between 1945 and 1947 , and reportedly abused their detainees .
the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- was planning to march in opposition , and described the administrative court 's decision to stop them as an " incredible ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : counter-demos against neo-nazis are common in germany " a very sad day for civil society , " said a statement from the dgb .
" but also a further incentive for us to proceed yet further against right-wing extremism . "
threat to public order the court decided in favor of the neo-nazi march , as it was organized first and was judged to present less of a threat to public order .
around 1,000 nazi sympathizers are expected , while the dgb said it was expecting up to 2,000 participants .
the large number of participants for both sides caused the schaumburg district court to originally block both demonstrations .
district official ursula mueller-kratz explained that the decision was made because an adequate number of police were not available to ensure safety .
but the hanover administrative court ruled on thursday that a police presence of around 2,000 officers was sufficient to oversee one demonstration .
neo-nazi forces have been commemorating the mistreatment of prisoners in bad nenndorf since 2006 , with the annual events increasing in popularity every year .

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

the economic revival , far better than expected , is based largely on a rise in exports . germany 's economy grew at a greater rate than forecast in the second quarter of 2010 , with gross domestic product 2.2 percent higher than during the first three months of the year . in comparison with the same time last year , germany 's economy grew by 4.1 percent for the period between april and june according to information released by the federal statistical office on friday . " reunified germany has never seen such quarterly growth before , " the office said in a statement .
analysts had forecast a growth rate of around 1.3 percent during the second quarter . exports surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle had high hopes for the year as a whole germany 's economic revival has been based largely on exports ; the country is the world 's second biggest exporter after china .
but the statistics agency also reported that household consumption and government expenditure contributed to the unexpectedly rapid growth . economy minister rainer bruederle said he believed growth far exceeding two percent was possible for the whole of 2010 .
" at the moment we are experiencing ' extra large ' growth , " said bruederle . exports have been bolstered by demand from china and other emerging economies .
the hamburg harbor logistics firm hhlaa noticed an increase in container freight traffic of 20 percent over the period , due to the rise in exports . weak euro , more contracts one reason german manufacturers are winning export sales could be that the euro is being kept low by concerns about weaker mediterranean partners . " it remains to be seen if the buoyancy of the eurozone core spills over to the periphery , or whether the periphery drags the core down , " said chris williamson of the london-based economics group markit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emerging economies such as china have fuelled the growth the increase in german growth boosted the figures for europe as a whole , with a one percent rise across both the 16-member eurozone and the 27-member eu .
those results , in both cases , represent the steepest growth in four years despite limited signs of recovery in some parts of the continent . first-quarter figures were also revised , up from 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent .
the global economic downturn saw germany 's gdp fall by 4.9 percent in 2009 . french finance minister christine lagarde also announced encouraging economic figures for her country .
french gdp increased by 0.6 percent between the first and second quarters , double the rate expected . spain announced a 0.2 percent growth in the second quarter , to underline its timid emergence from recession . author : thomas sheldrick / richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .
donors worry funds will fall into the wrong hands sandra bulling of care deutschland-luxemburg told deutsche welle that pakistan 's reputation for corruption and supporting islamist terrorists scared many potential donors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions are inaccessible to aid workers " we have received calls from private donors who asked us if the money they donate will reach the people in need and wo n't go to the government .
what they hear in the media is that the pakistani government might be corrupt , that money will vanish down government channels , " bulling said .
" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "
the wrong time for a catastrophe care and other aid organizations believe the lack of donations to pakistan also has to do with the timing of the disaster .
bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .
not only are many germans now away on summer holiday - away from the media and their bank accounts - but many are afflicted by " donor fatigue , " according to svenja koch of the red cross .

so far , islamabad has confirmed 1,343 deaths , with over 1,000 in the northwestern khyber-pakhtunkhwa province alone .
the un estimates a death toll of over 1,600 .
pakistan says that between 15 and 20 million residents have been affected by the floods .
the un estimates that 6 million people will be dependent on relief aid for survival , many of whom have been cut off by flooded roads and collapsed bridges according to oxfam germany chief ralf bendix , the relatively low number of causalities in pakistan can be dangerously misleading to potential donors given the precarious position of millions of survivors .
" in the other disasters one hundred thousand died immediately .
obviously it 's easier to mobilize the attention of the public and the government when there 's a high number of casualities than it is when you tell them there will be many more deaths if nothing is done , " he said .
pakistan slowly moving to action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief supplies are running out the pakistani government friday announced plans to intensify its own rescue and aid efforts for flood victims .
after visiting affected regions , prime minister yousuf raza gilani said " the extent of total damage to life , property , cattle head and infrastructure may be far more than what the initial estimates suggested . "
the premier and president asif ali zardari - who has come under massive criticism for making two european trips during the disaster - agreed that " a massive mobilization of resources including budgetary re-prioritization may be required , " according to a statement from the presidential palace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 13.08.2010 berlin finds its voice at the new speaker 's corner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is no longer the only european capital with a speaker 's corner .
a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 13.08.2010 coltan mines to be ' fingerprinted , ' german scientists say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantalum is exctracted from coltan ore researchers say they have come up with a new way to prove where coltan samples came from .
that could allow companies and refineries to purchase african coltan knowing that it did not come from a conflict area . in the late 1990s and early 2000s the world began to wake up to the reality of " blood diamonds , " or diamonds mined in regions of sub-saharan africa used to fund violent conflicts , especially in liberia , angola and sierra leone . but over the last decade , activists , scientists , and politicians have also been made increasingly aware of the use of coltan mining to fund similar conflicts central africa , especially in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . in 2009 , german mineral authorities said that africa produced half of the world 's coltan , significantly up from previous years as major mines in canada and australia were shut down due to coltan 's falling price .
the metallic ore contains tantalum , a key element in the production of semi-conductors and capacitors found in nearly every consumer electronic device , including ipods , mobile phones and video game consoles . a study released in may by the london-based resource consulting services -lrb- rcs -rrb- said that in 2009 , a group of hutu rebels in rwanda , the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda , were 75 percent funded by the sale of minerals like coltan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region in eastern congo contain important deposit of coltan but governments worldwide are starting to take action .
us president barack obama recently signed into law a provision requiring more transparency in the mineral mining sector .
the european union does not currently have any similar provisions . the american law will require companies sourcing coltan from the drc and its nine neighboring countries , including rwanda , to prove that their mineral exports are conflict-free .
some development activists have said that while this is a positive development , turning the new law into an effective embargo may be a nearly impossible task . but in recent years , german scientists have said that they have found a method of chemical analysis to determine which coltan samples are conflict-free .
they said each coltan sample from a particular mine has a given " fingerprint , " or unique set of characteristics . ' it 's a totally different mineralogy ' from his office at the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover , frank melcher has a collection of rock cuttings in small see-through boxes and plastic bags spread out .
next to each box and bag he puts a color print-out of pictures taken with an electron microscope .
to the untrained eye they look like pictures of mosaic floor , but for melcher they indicate far more . " if you compare coltan samples from different proveniences , it 's quite obvious , " he said .
" this is a sample from rwanda , this one 's from australia .
the dye distribution is totally different .
it 's a totally different mineralogy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melcher examines the origin of coltan melcher is one of many german scientists working to set up a " certified trading chain , " which would establish the origin of coltan samples . he relies on more than using visual cues to identify a coltan sample 's provenance .
melcher and his colleagues also use an electron microprobe that hits the sample with an electron beam .
the emerging x-rays indicate which chemical elements are contained in the sample . " i can see right away what elements are contained in this sample and how much of them , " he said .
" here it 's tantalum , there it 's niobium , manganese , iron and i spot some titanium as well . " german government scientists are using this technique to register the fingerprints of legitimate mines that then could be compared to field samples mined in the future .
the idea would be to provide incontrovertible evidence showing that a sample of coltan was mined in a conflict-free zone .
melcher said he has reference samples from 75 percent of the world 's coltan mines . " we hope that one day only truly clean products leave african soil , " he said . " in connection with environmental and social standards this could be the way to go for raw materials , " he added .
" we want a trading chain with european and american companies purchasing goods directly from the african market .
this is impossible for them at the moment . " however , samples from mines in china and the drc comprise the remaining 25 percent , he added . " the chinese are n't interested in delivering samples , and drc is impossible to access , " he said . european refineries stand to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german process could limit coltan mining to conflict-free regions some german companies have already been affected by the shadiness of the coltan trade .
h.c. starck , based in the central german city of goslar , has one of the many refineries around europe that takes coltan ore and refines it into pure tantalum . h.c. starck is one of the few companies capable of completing the complex process of making tiny , reliable and heat-resistant capacitors out of tantalum .
but 10 years ago the united nations accused the company of using tantalum from war-torn regions of congo and h.c. starck 's reputation suffered significantly . after the accusations became public , the company began cooperating with the united nations and re-evaluated its coltan acquisition process .
starck now does not purchase any tantalum from africa . " while working through everything together with the un panel , we found out , that not every retailer had told us the truth concerning the material 's origin - despite assuring otherwise , " said manfred buetefisch , a company spokesperson .
" that 's when we realized that - seeing the ongoing war in east africa and the drc - that they are not reliable partners for us , and that we can not buy any material there anymore . " companies like h.c. stark are now banking on being able to rely more and more on african coltan .
the company already bought a nrd rwanda , a small mining company in rwanda .
soon , every one of its deliveries will be certified by the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover . rock cuttings for the license have already been already charted and included in frank melcher 's database .
by taking random control samples the geologist can now verify whether coltan was taken from the company 's mine in rwanda . " this is of course an ideal case : a company investing in the local mining industry , importing the coltan on its own and making sure that it is no illegally mined material infecting the trading chain , " melcher said . certification is slow moving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coltan is often separated from other rocks by hand one year ago the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources invited all 10 rwandan mining companies for a certification workshop .
the companies ' chief executives were reserved in the beginning but four companies joined nrd rwanda and have signed up for the testing procedures . industry analysts have said that the new practice may pressure african coltan-exporting countries to clean up their mining practices on their own , without relying on harsher external policies . " this might limit corruption , violence and other conflicts fought over coltan and other resources , " said peter eigen of the ngo transparency international .
" once the companies voluntarily agree to cooperate , it 's easier to make a point rather than trying to boycott these raw materials or subject them to certain conditions . " but first , the hannover geologists have to adapt their methods to the industry in the congo .
and they all know that it 's a far cry from the way things work in rwanda to the unstable situation in the democratic republic of the congo . while german scientists say getting congo and china to adopt their methods will be difficult , they said they are confident their process change coltan mining in the long term .
while they are willing to provide the fingerprinting system , they say that the certification chain must be located in africa to be most effective , and that its implementation remains a local political issue .

dw-akademie has been training peace journalists there . congo is turning fifty .
many international media outlets are marking the anniversary by reporting on the state of this crisis-ravaged country in central africa .
“ in congo itself there are a number of celebrations ordered by those from higher up , but the local journalists are currently preoccupied with issues other than independence , ” says michael tecklenburg .
he has just returned from bukavu , the provincial capital of south kivu , which has been in crisis for years .
the situation there is a far cry from peaceful coexistence .
“ independence alone is not enough , ” says tecklenburg .
he is a dw-akademie media trainer and in june he ran the second part of a workshop on conflict-sensitive journalism .
twenty radio journalists and technicians took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the first week , the journalists practiced various journalistic conventions and radio formats , including how to conduct an interview and edit it sensitively .
the technicians focused on improving the sound quality of their recordings .
this way the comprehensibility of their reports was improved in both editorial and technical terms .
the second week was spent producing listener-oriented reports .
“ a team drove out of bukavu to a rural area at four in the morning to accompany women on their 30 kilometer trek from the village to the town market , ” reports tecklenburg .
the female reporters then had four hours to talk to the market women about their worries and everyday problems .
they learned of tensions not just between ethnic groups , but also between the sexes .
tecklenburg believes a report of this nature can raise people ’ s awareness of the conflict “ by showing clearly the difficult conditions under which women live in congo . ”
the situation in bukavu and the entire province of south kivu remains difficult to assess .
“ chaos and lawlessness are the order of the day , ” says tecklenburg , “ but blaming the many conflicts on ethnic differences is too easy .
yet , he says , that is what journalists often do .
tecklenburg says the reporting is often one-sided and prejudiced .
he says dw-akademie aims to show people alternatives with this project .
a ‘ club of conflict-sensitive journalists ’ now exists since the first workshop in congo was held in 2008 .
“ the journalists and broadcasters involved regularly produce a half-hour magazine program together , broadcast once a month on the eight radio stations in bukavu which have signed up .
this helps minimize conflicts and sensitizes people to them , ” says tecklenburg .
it is important to stress what people have in common in a climate where differences can quickly lead to conflicts , he adds .
“ that is exactly what the radio stations are doing with their magazine program . ”
this long-term project is to be continued in the coming year – this time on an international scale : “ in future we ’ ll be inviting journalists from the democratic republic of the congo , burundi and rwanda and offer training courses in all three countries . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de budget -pipe- 13.08.2010 eu member states aim to slow growth of budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal still increases the budget overall by 2.9 percent european union national governments slashed nearly four billion euros from a proposed eu budget on thursday , setting the stage for a heated debate on the bloc 's role and how much money it needs to fulfill it . the european union 's executive body has asked for a 5.7 percent budget increase , but the 27 member states footing the bill have proposed a more modest raise , with some states calling for an overall cut instead .
the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .
fight ahead in parliament member states , which are represented in the council of the european union , the effective upper legislative body , are now to debate the budget proposals with the european parliament .
" it is not our intention to redo our numbers , " patrizio fiorilli , spokesman for eu budget chief janusz lewandowski , told news agency agence france-presse . instead the commission would hope to win over european legislators in a 21-day reconciliation process to begin on october 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament is next to debate the budget lewandowski has been under heavy pressure from cash-strapped member states to present a more thrifty version of the eu budget , which many euroskeptics see as little more than a black hole of bureaucracy .
his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

dw-akademie has been training peace journalists there . congo is turning fifty .
many international media outlets are marking the anniversary by reporting on the state of this crisis-ravaged country in central africa .
“ in congo itself there are a number of celebrations ordered by those from higher up , but the local journalists are currently preoccupied with issues other than independence , ” says michael tecklenburg .
he has just returned from bukavu , the provincial capital of south kivu , which has been in crisis for years .
the situation there is a far cry from peaceful coexistence .
“ independence alone is not enough , ” says tecklenburg .
he is a dw-akademie media trainer and in june he ran the second part of a workshop on conflict-sensitive journalism .
twenty radio journalists and technicians took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the first week , the journalists practiced various journalistic conventions and radio formats , including how to conduct an interview and edit it sensitively .
the technicians focused on improving the sound quality of their recordings .
this way the comprehensibility of their reports was improved in both editorial and technical terms .
the second week was spent producing listener-oriented reports .
“ a team drove out of bukavu to a rural area at four in the morning to accompany women on their 30 kilometer trek from the village to the town market , ” reports tecklenburg .
the female reporters then had four hours to talk to the market women about their worries and everyday problems .
they learned of tensions not just between ethnic groups , but also between the sexes .

that could allow companies and refineries to purchase african coltan knowing that it did not come from a conflict area . in the late 1990s and early 2000s the world began to wake up to the reality of " blood diamonds , " or diamonds mined in regions of sub-saharan africa used to fund violent conflicts , especially in liberia , angola and sierra leone . but over the last decade , activists , scientists , and politicians have also been made increasingly aware of the use of coltan mining to fund similar conflicts central africa , especially in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . in 2009 , german mineral authorities said that africa produced half of the world 's coltan , significantly up from previous years as major mines in canada and australia were shut down due to coltan 's falling price .
the metallic ore contains tantalum , a key element in the production of semi-conductors and capacitors found in nearly every consumer electronic device , including ipods , mobile phones and video game consoles . a study released in may by the london-based resource consulting services -lrb- rcs -rrb- said that in 2009 , a group of hutu rebels in rwanda , the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda , were 75 percent funded by the sale of minerals like coltan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region in eastern congo contain important deposit of coltan but governments worldwide are starting to take action .
us president barack obama recently signed into law a provision requiring more transparency in the mineral mining sector .
the european union does not currently have any similar provisions . the american law will require companies sourcing coltan from the drc and its nine neighboring countries , including rwanda , to prove that their mineral exports are conflict-free .
some development activists have said that while this is a positive development , turning the new law into an effective embargo may be a nearly impossible task . but in recent years , german scientists have said that they have found a method of chemical analysis to determine which coltan samples are conflict-free .
they said each coltan sample from a particular mine has a given " fingerprint , " or unique set of characteristics . ' it 's a totally different mineralogy ' from his office at the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover , frank melcher has a collection of rock cuttings in small see-through boxes and plastic bags spread out .
next to each box and bag he puts a color print-out of pictures taken with an electron microscope .
to the untrained eye they look like pictures of mosaic floor , but for melcher they indicate far more . " if you compare coltan samples from different proveniences , it 's quite obvious , " he said .
" this is a sample from rwanda , this one 's from australia .
the dye distribution is totally different .
it 's a totally different mineralogy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melcher examines the origin of coltan melcher is one of many german scientists working to set up a " certified trading chain , " which would establish the origin of coltan samples . he relies on more than using visual cues to identify a coltan sample 's provenance .
melcher and his colleagues also use an electron microprobe that hits the sample with an electron beam .
the emerging x-rays indicate which chemical elements are contained in the sample . " i can see right away what elements are contained in this sample and how much of them , " he said .
" here it 's tantalum , there it 's niobium , manganese , iron and i spot some titanium as well . " german government scientists are using this technique to register the fingerprints of legitimate mines that then could be compared to field samples mined in the future .
the idea would be to provide incontrovertible evidence showing that a sample of coltan was mined in a conflict-free zone .
melcher said he has reference samples from 75 percent of the world 's coltan mines . " we hope that one day only truly clean products leave african soil , " he said . " in connection with environmental and social standards this could be the way to go for raw materials , " he added .
" we want a trading chain with european and american companies purchasing goods directly from the african market .
this is impossible for them at the moment . " however , samples from mines in china and the drc comprise the remaining 25 percent , he added . " the chinese are n't interested in delivering samples , and drc is impossible to access , " he said . european refineries stand to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german process could limit coltan mining to conflict-free regions some german companies have already been affected by the shadiness of the coltan trade .
h.c. starck , based in the central german city of goslar , has one of the many refineries around europe that takes coltan ore and refines it into pure tantalum . h.c. starck is one of the few companies capable of completing the complex process of making tiny , reliable and heat-resistant capacitors out of tantalum .
but 10 years ago the united nations accused the company of using tantalum from war-torn regions of congo and h.c. starck 's reputation suffered significantly . after the accusations became public , the company began cooperating with the united nations and re-evaluated its coltan acquisition process .
starck now does not purchase any tantalum from africa . " while working through everything together with the un panel , we found out , that not every retailer had told us the truth concerning the material 's origin - despite assuring otherwise , " said manfred buetefisch , a company spokesperson .
" that 's when we realized that - seeing the ongoing war in east africa and the drc - that they are not reliable partners for us , and that we can not buy any material there anymore . " companies like h.c. stark are now banking on being able to rely more and more on african coltan .
the company already bought a nrd rwanda , a small mining company in rwanda .
soon , every one of its deliveries will be certified by the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover . rock cuttings for the license have already been already charted and included in frank melcher 's database .
by taking random control samples the geologist can now verify whether coltan was taken from the company 's mine in rwanda . " this is of course an ideal case : a company investing in the local mining industry , importing the coltan on its own and making sure that it is no illegally mined material infecting the trading chain , " melcher said . certification is slow moving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coltan is often separated from other rocks by hand one year ago the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources invited all 10 rwandan mining companies for a certification workshop .
the companies ' chief executives were reserved in the beginning but four companies joined nrd rwanda and have signed up for the testing procedures . industry analysts have said that the new practice may pressure african coltan-exporting countries to clean up their mining practices on their own , without relying on harsher external policies . " this might limit corruption , violence and other conflicts fought over coltan and other resources , " said peter eigen of the ngo transparency international .
" once the companies voluntarily agree to cooperate , it 's easier to make a point rather than trying to boycott these raw materials or subject them to certain conditions . " but first , the hannover geologists have to adapt their methods to the industry in the congo .
and they all know that it 's a far cry from the way things work in rwanda to the unstable situation in the democratic republic of the congo . while german scientists say getting congo and china to adopt their methods will be difficult , they said they are confident their process change coltan mining in the long term .
while they are willing to provide the fingerprinting system , they say that the certification chain must be located in africa to be most effective , and that its implementation remains a local political issue . " there will be a big meeting in nairobi before the end of the year for certification procedures , " melcher said . " we hope that fingerprinting will be part of the measures that they take .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de budget -pipe- 13.08.2010 eu member states aim to slow growth of budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal still increases the budget overall by 2.9 percent european union national governments slashed nearly four billion euros from a proposed eu budget on thursday , setting the stage for a heated debate on the bloc 's role and how much money it needs to fulfill it . the european union 's executive body has asked for a 5.7 percent budget increase , but the 27 member states footing the bill have proposed a more modest raise , with some states calling for an overall cut instead .
the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .
fight ahead in parliament member states , which are represented in the council of the european union , the effective upper legislative body , are now to debate the budget proposals with the european parliament .
" it is not our intention to redo our numbers , " patrizio fiorilli , spokesman for eu budget chief janusz lewandowski , told news agency agence france-presse . instead the commission would hope to win over european legislators in a 21-day reconciliation process to begin on october 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament is next to debate the budget lewandowski has been under heavy pressure from cash-strapped member states to present a more thrifty version of the eu budget , which many euroskeptics see as little more than a black hole of bureaucracy .
his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 13.08.2010 america taking risks , germany taking heed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy continued to shed jobs in july , generating fears of another downturn in the united states , the dream of perpetually rising living standards has bottomed out in growing unemployment .
across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .

barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .

but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .

the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 13.08.2010 insurers face mounting catastrophe claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurers began counting the costs of disasters early in the year 2010 is proving a rather expensive year for insurers , as claims mount amid a growing number of natural disasters around the world .
the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has also threatened sanctions against the uk-based carrier .
" easyjet can not hide behind safety regulations for refusing to board passengers who have difficulty moving around , " the french transport ministry said in a statement .
" it must implement solutions adapted to each case , as most companies do .
otherwise it must be sanctioned with the greatest severity . "
the ministry also said that other airlines had already found appropriate solutions .
one of the affected passengers had lodged a complaint with the french anti-discrimination watchdog halde , which has criticized the fact that there is no official regulation on how to deal with disabled passengers .
safety concerns a spokeswoman for easyjet told the french news agency afp that the airline " was already in discussion with the french government to find a solution that is suitable for our passengers without compromising their security . "
the announcement by the french transport ministry comes after three separate incidents , in which paraplegic passengers were not allowed on the plane unaccompanied .
the reason given by the airline was that those passengers can not move without assistance .
easyjet says it is worried about safety , as regulations oblige it to be able to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds .
the airline says it is authorized to ask someone to accompany those who need assistance .
in one case , however , the carrier refused to let the disabled passenger on board despite a fellow passenger offering to assist .

trade unionists have strongly condemned the verdict . a hanover court has approved a planned neo-nazi march in a town in the state of lower saxony this weekend , but prohibited a trade union counter-demonstration from taking place .
right-wing extremists will hold a " funeral march " on saturday in bad nenndorf , where british occupying forces interrogated nazis between 1945 and 1947 , and reportedly abused their detainees .
the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- was planning to march in opposition , and described the administrative court 's decision to stop them as an " incredible ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : counter-demos against neo-nazis are common in germany " a very sad day for civil society , " said a statement from the dgb .
" but also a further incentive for us to proceed yet further against right-wing extremism . "
threat to public order the court decided in favor of the neo-nazi march , as it was organized first and was judged to present less of a threat to public order .
around 1,000 nazi sympathizers are expected , while the dgb said it was expecting up to 2,000 participants .
the large number of participants for both sides caused the schaumburg district court to originally block both demonstrations .
district official ursula mueller-kratz explained that the decision was made because an adequate number of police were not available to ensure safety .
but the hanover administrative court ruled on thursday that a police presence of around 2,000 officers was sufficient to oversee one demonstration .
neo-nazi forces have been commemorating the mistreatment of prisoners in bad nenndorf since 2006 , with the annual events increasing in popularity every year .

the ministry also said that other airlines had already found appropriate solutions .
one of the affected passengers had lodged a complaint with the french anti-discrimination watchdog halde , which has criticized the fact that there is no official regulation on how to deal with disabled passengers .
safety concerns a spokeswoman for easyjet told the french news agency afp that the airline " was already in discussion with the french government to find a solution that is suitable for our passengers without compromising their security . "
the announcement by the french transport ministry comes after three separate incidents , in which paraplegic passengers were not allowed on the plane unaccompanied .
the reason given by the airline was that those passengers can not move without assistance .
easyjet says it is worried about safety , as regulations oblige it to be able to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds .
the airline says it is authorized to ask someone to accompany those who need assistance .
in one case , however , the carrier refused to let the disabled passenger on board despite a fellow passenger offering to assist .

dw-akademie has been training peace journalists there . congo is turning fifty .
many international media outlets are marking the anniversary by reporting on the state of this crisis-ravaged country in central africa .
“ in congo itself there are a number of celebrations ordered by those from higher up , but the local journalists are currently preoccupied with issues other than independence , ” says michael tecklenburg .
he has just returned from bukavu , the provincial capital of south kivu , which has been in crisis for years .
the situation there is a far cry from peaceful coexistence .
“ independence alone is not enough , ” says tecklenburg .
he is a dw-akademie media trainer and in june he ran the second part of a workshop on conflict-sensitive journalism .
twenty radio journalists and technicians took part .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the first week , the journalists practiced various journalistic conventions and radio formats , including how to conduct an interview and edit it sensitively .
the technicians focused on improving the sound quality of their recordings .
this way the comprehensibility of their reports was improved in both editorial and technical terms .
the second week was spent producing listener-oriented reports .
“ a team drove out of bukavu to a rural area at four in the morning to accompany women on their 30 kilometer trek from the village to the town market , ” reports tecklenburg .
the female reporters then had four hours to talk to the market women about their worries and everyday problems .
they learned of tensions not just between ethnic groups , but also between the sexes .
tecklenburg believes a report of this nature can raise people ’ s awareness of the conflict “ by showing clearly the difficult conditions under which women live in congo . ”
the situation in bukavu and the entire province of south kivu remains difficult to assess .
“ chaos and lawlessness are the order of the day , ” says tecklenburg , “ but blaming the many conflicts on ethnic differences is too easy .
yet , he says , that is what journalists often do .
tecklenburg says the reporting is often one-sided and prejudiced .
he says dw-akademie aims to show people alternatives with this project .
a ‘ club of conflict-sensitive journalists ’ now exists since the first workshop in congo was held in 2008 .
“ the journalists and broadcasters involved regularly produce a half-hour magazine program together , broadcast once a month on the eight radio stations in bukavu which have signed up .
this helps minimize conflicts and sensitizes people to them , ” says tecklenburg .
it is important to stress what people have in common in a climate where differences can quickly lead to conflicts , he adds .
“ that is exactly what the radio stations are doing with their magazine program . ”
this long-term project is to be continued in the coming year – this time on an international scale : “ in future we ’ ll be inviting journalists from the democratic republic of the congo , burundi and rwanda and offer training courses in all three countries . ”

the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .
fight ahead in parliament member states , which are represented in the council of the european union , the effective upper legislative body , are now to debate the budget proposals with the european parliament .
" it is not our intention to redo our numbers , " patrizio fiorilli , spokesman for eu budget chief janusz lewandowski , told news agency agence france-presse . instead the commission would hope to win over european legislators in a 21-day reconciliation process to begin on october 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament is next to debate the budget lewandowski has been under heavy pressure from cash-strapped member states to present a more thrifty version of the eu budget , which many euroskeptics see as little more than a black hole of bureaucracy .
his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .

conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

the economic revival , far better than expected , is based largely on a rise in exports . germany 's economy grew at a greater rate than forecast in the second quarter of 2010 , with gross domestic product 2.2 percent higher than during the first three months of the year . in comparison with the same time last year , germany 's economy grew by 4.1 percent for the period between april and june according to information released by the federal statistical office on friday .

" at the moment we are experiencing ' extra large ' growth , " said bruederle . exports have been bolstered by demand from china and other emerging economies .
the hamburg harbor logistics firm hhlaa noticed an increase in container freight traffic of 20 percent over the period , due to the rise in exports . weak euro , more contracts one reason german manufacturers are winning export sales could be that the euro is being kept low by concerns about weaker mediterranean partners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 13.08.2010 insurers face mounting catastrophe claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurers began counting the costs of disasters early in the year 2010 is proving a rather expensive year for insurers , as claims mount amid a growing number of natural disasters around the world .
the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

it has also threatened sanctions against the uk-based carrier .
" easyjet can not hide behind safety regulations for refusing to board passengers who have difficulty moving around , " the french transport ministry said in a statement .
" it must implement solutions adapted to each case , as most companies do .
otherwise it must be sanctioned with the greatest severity . "
the ministry also said that other airlines had already found appropriate solutions .
one of the affected passengers had lodged a complaint with the french anti-discrimination watchdog halde , which has criticized the fact that there is no official regulation on how to deal with disabled passengers .
safety concerns a spokeswoman for easyjet told the french news agency afp that the airline " was already in discussion with the french government to find a solution that is suitable for our passengers without compromising their security . "
the announcement by the french transport ministry comes after three separate incidents , in which paraplegic passengers were not allowed on the plane unaccompanied .
the reason given by the airline was that those passengers can not move without assistance .
easyjet says it is worried about safety , as regulations oblige it to be able to evacuate an aircraft in 90 seconds .
the airline says it is authorized to ask someone to accompany those who need assistance .
in one case , however , the carrier refused to let the disabled passenger on board despite a fellow passenger offering to assist .

across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

the economic revival , far better than expected , is based largely on a rise in exports . germany 's economy grew at a greater rate than forecast in the second quarter of 2010 , with gross domestic product 2.2 percent higher than during the first three months of the year . in comparison with the same time last year , germany 's economy grew by 4.1 percent for the period between april and june according to information released by the federal statistical office on friday .

" at the moment we are experiencing ' extra large ' growth , " said bruederle . exports have been bolstered by demand from china and other emerging economies .
the hamburg harbor logistics firm hhlaa noticed an increase in container freight traffic of 20 percent over the period , due to the rise in exports . weak euro , more contracts one reason german manufacturers are winning export sales could be that the euro is being kept low by concerns about weaker mediterranean partners .

the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

in northern punjab , victims wonder if they have been forgotten . the car moves slowly across a rickety bridge that crosses the indus river and has miraculously survived the floods .
there is brown muddy water raging on either side .
kalabagh , just on the other side of the bridge a hundred meters away , looks idyllic from a distance , with its mountainous panorama . however , the closer one gets , the more apparent is the devastation .
as it swelled up with heavy rain , the indus swept away everything in its path .
whole houses were destroyed .
it is impossible to calculate how many people died . a huge lake of mud where there used to be fields , there is just one huge lake of mud now .
the only road is completely blocked .
one of the local farmers mohammad taiz is trying to clear a path but this seems to be a sisyphean task .
" the water keeps coming back , " he says .
" every two days , it rains heavily and we have to start all over again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages are under water mr taiz says that although cars are able to cross the bridge , he has seen no delivery of relief supplies .
he wonders if he and the other survivors have been " forgotten " . hussein imdad , another farmer from the village , feels the same .
at first , he was able to keep his home intact by digging mud away .
however , " it kept getting worse and the rain rose suddenly .
it came up to our necks and we had to flee .
there were no boats so i took the children by their hands .
in the end , we swam and that 's the only way we survived . " mr imdad has taken shelter at the local infirmary .
it is a primitive concrete building with several rooms and one table on which medicine is stored . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands of people are homeless he thinks he and his family will have to stay " at least one or two months because everything at home is destroyed .
at least , it 's safe here . " rising incidence of disease and skin infections it may be safe but there is no comfort .
the fan is broken and there are flies everywhere . mohammad amin , the manager , is desperate .
he explains that at least 200 people show up every day .
they have " typhus , diarrhea , malaria , gastroenteritis and skin infections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us military has put 19 helicopters at the disposal of relief efforts however , there is hardly any medicine to treat them with and little hope of more coming soon .
mr amin says that there has been no sign of international relief .
local government officials and ngos have delivered some fresh water , flour and wheat but not enough and not regularly . islamabad is five hours away .
this is where the victims are looking to , hoping that the government will help them rebuild their homes and replant their fields .
otherwise , they fear that they will have " nothing " . author : jürgen webermann / act editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .

" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "

eight so-called " right-to-information " activists have been killed in a year . last month , amit jethwa , a prominent environmentalist and information warrior , was shot dead by two unidentified gunmen just opposite the gujarat high court in the western city of ahmedabad . just a few days earlier , he had filed a public interest petition at the same court .
the petition named a prominent politician as one of the many interested parties involved in illegal mining activities in the protected gir forest . another activist , satish shetty , was killed by unidentified men earlier this year .
he had shot to fame after exposing certain corrupt land deals related to the country 's first expressway from mumbai to pune . eight deaths , 20 serious attacks in total , there have been eight deaths and over 20 serious attacks in the past year alone .
they have brought into sharp focus the obstacles hindering the successful implementation of india 's landmark right to information act that is supposed to expose corruption in the government and came into existence in october 2005 . the national transparency watchdog , the central information commission -lrb- cic -rrb- , admitted that there was cause for concern . " the rti act is now beginning to bite , " said wajahat habibullah , the chief information commissioner .
" it had a bite earlier but it is now beginning to bite into vested interests also .
and the vested interests will spare no effort and have no compunction in using excessive measures to try and crush activism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wajahat habibullah , the chief information commissioner of india before the law was passed , citizens and activists found it difficult to obtain information from federal and state authorities . powerful tool for exposing corruption in its five years of existence , the right to information act has become a powerful tool that has been used to expose the connections between corrupt officials , politicians and even the mafia . sensitive information , which the bureaucrats and political establishment would prefer kept outside the public domain so as to protect their own interests , has started coming out . so there has been a backlash , says shekhar singh , the convener of the national council for people 's right to information or ncpri . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists say they need to work collectively to avoid being targeted individually " it is of course sad and unfortunate but also inevitable because once you have a law as powerful as the rti , it is only worthwhile if it ruffles vested interests , " he said .
" vested interests have a history not only in this country but the world over of fighting back .
so what we have to do is build up strategies which protect our activists . " activists need to work together vinita singh , who has made use of the right to information act in mumbai and delhi , said that there needed to be solidarity between activists who should work together if they were to avoid life-threatening situations . " rti activism is often done at an individual level , you get information , try to figure out what to do with it .
we work as lonesome information warriors .
we need networks , we need to act collectively or at least find people who are related to it .
i think the more we do that , the better are our chances of making an impact and also working in a way that will not harm individual people . " individuals have been using the right of information act as a weapon to expose corruption .
however , the government does not seem to be fulfilling its part of the deal , which is to bring culprits to book or give protection to whistleblowers . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trade unionists have strongly condemned the verdict . a hanover court has approved a planned neo-nazi march in a town in the state of lower saxony this weekend , but prohibited a trade union counter-demonstration from taking place .
right-wing extremists will hold a " funeral march " on saturday in bad nenndorf , where british occupying forces interrogated nazis between 1945 and 1947 , and reportedly abused their detainees .
the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- was planning to march in opposition , and described the administrative court 's decision to stop them as an " incredible ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : counter-demos against neo-nazis are common in germany " a very sad day for civil society , " said a statement from the dgb .
" but also a further incentive for us to proceed yet further against right-wing extremism . "
threat to public order the court decided in favor of the neo-nazi march , as it was organized first and was judged to present less of a threat to public order .
around 1,000 nazi sympathizers are expected , while the dgb said it was expecting up to 2,000 participants .
the large number of participants for both sides caused the schaumburg district court to originally block both demonstrations .
district official ursula mueller-kratz explained that the decision was made because an adequate number of police were not available to ensure safety .
but the hanover administrative court ruled on thursday that a police presence of around 2,000 officers was sufficient to oversee one demonstration .
neo-nazi forces have been commemorating the mistreatment of prisoners in bad nenndorf since 2006 , with the annual events increasing in popularity every year .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .

conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.08.2010 refugee camps to use gas from human waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three refugee camps in the world have inadequate sanitation facilities energy shortages and poor sanitation are two of the most serious problems in refugee camps .
now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .
donors worry funds will fall into the wrong hands sandra bulling of care deutschland-luxemburg told deutsche welle that pakistan 's reputation for corruption and supporting islamist terrorists scared many potential donors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions are inaccessible to aid workers " we have received calls from private donors who asked us if the money they donate will reach the people in need and wo n't go to the government .
what they hear in the media is that the pakistani government might be corrupt , that money will vanish down government channels , " bulling said .
" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "
the wrong time for a catastrophe care and other aid organizations believe the lack of donations to pakistan also has to do with the timing of the disaster .
bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .
not only are many germans now away on summer holiday - away from the media and their bank accounts - but many are afflicted by " donor fatigue , " according to svenja koch of the red cross .
" we 've had a summer of catastrophes .
from the oil-soaked pelicans in the gulf of mexico to the love parade tragedy to the floods in saxony to the wildfires in russia , " koch said .

so far , islamabad has confirmed 1,343 deaths , with over 1,000 in the northwestern khyber-pakhtunkhwa province alone .
the un estimates a death toll of over 1,600 .
pakistan says that between 15 and 20 million residents have been affected by the floods .
the un estimates that 6 million people will be dependent on relief aid for survival , many of whom have been cut off by flooded roads and collapsed bridges according to oxfam germany chief ralf bendix , the relatively low number of causalities in pakistan can be dangerously misleading to potential donors given the precarious position of millions of survivors .
" in the other disasters one hundred thousand died immediately .

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .
donors worry funds will fall into the wrong hands sandra bulling of care deutschland-luxemburg told deutsche welle that pakistan 's reputation for corruption and supporting islamist terrorists scared many potential donors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions are inaccessible to aid workers " we have received calls from private donors who asked us if the money they donate will reach the people in need and wo n't go to the government .
what they hear in the media is that the pakistani government might be corrupt , that money will vanish down government channels , " bulling said .
" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de regulation -pipe- 13.08.2010 coltan mines to be ' fingerprinted , ' german scientists say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tantalum is exctracted from coltan ore researchers say they have come up with a new way to prove where coltan samples came from .
that could allow companies and refineries to purchase african coltan knowing that it did not come from a conflict area . in the late 1990s and early 2000s the world began to wake up to the reality of " blood diamonds , " or diamonds mined in regions of sub-saharan africa used to fund violent conflicts , especially in liberia , angola and sierra leone . but over the last decade , activists , scientists , and politicians have also been made increasingly aware of the use of coltan mining to fund similar conflicts central africa , especially in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- . in 2009 , german mineral authorities said that africa produced half of the world 's coltan , significantly up from previous years as major mines in canada and australia were shut down due to coltan 's falling price .
the metallic ore contains tantalum , a key element in the production of semi-conductors and capacitors found in nearly every consumer electronic device , including ipods , mobile phones and video game consoles . a study released in may by the london-based resource consulting services -lrb- rcs -rrb- said that in 2009 , a group of hutu rebels in rwanda , the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda , were 75 percent funded by the sale of minerals like coltan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the masisi region in eastern congo contain important deposit of coltan but governments worldwide are starting to take action .
us president barack obama recently signed into law a provision requiring more transparency in the mineral mining sector .
the european union does not currently have any similar provisions . the american law will require companies sourcing coltan from the drc and its nine neighboring countries , including rwanda , to prove that their mineral exports are conflict-free .
some development activists have said that while this is a positive development , turning the new law into an effective embargo may be a nearly impossible task . but in recent years , german scientists have said that they have found a method of chemical analysis to determine which coltan samples are conflict-free .
they said each coltan sample from a particular mine has a given " fingerprint , " or unique set of characteristics . ' it 's a totally different mineralogy ' from his office at the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover , frank melcher has a collection of rock cuttings in small see-through boxes and plastic bags spread out .
next to each box and bag he puts a color print-out of pictures taken with an electron microscope .
to the untrained eye they look like pictures of mosaic floor , but for melcher they indicate far more . " if you compare coltan samples from different proveniences , it 's quite obvious , " he said .
" this is a sample from rwanda , this one 's from australia .
the dye distribution is totally different .
it 's a totally different mineralogy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melcher examines the origin of coltan melcher is one of many german scientists working to set up a " certified trading chain , " which would establish the origin of coltan samples . he relies on more than using visual cues to identify a coltan sample 's provenance .
melcher and his colleagues also use an electron microprobe that hits the sample with an electron beam .
the emerging x-rays indicate which chemical elements are contained in the sample . " i can see right away what elements are contained in this sample and how much of them , " he said .
" here it 's tantalum , there it 's niobium , manganese , iron and i spot some titanium as well . " german government scientists are using this technique to register the fingerprints of legitimate mines that then could be compared to field samples mined in the future .
the idea would be to provide incontrovertible evidence showing that a sample of coltan was mined in a conflict-free zone .
melcher said he has reference samples from 75 percent of the world 's coltan mines . " we hope that one day only truly clean products leave african soil , " he said . " in connection with environmental and social standards this could be the way to go for raw materials , " he added .
" we want a trading chain with european and american companies purchasing goods directly from the african market .
this is impossible for them at the moment . " however , samples from mines in china and the drc comprise the remaining 25 percent , he added . " the chinese are n't interested in delivering samples , and drc is impossible to access , " he said . european refineries stand to benefit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german process could limit coltan mining to conflict-free regions some german companies have already been affected by the shadiness of the coltan trade .
h.c. starck , based in the central german city of goslar , has one of the many refineries around europe that takes coltan ore and refines it into pure tantalum . h.c. starck is one of the few companies capable of completing the complex process of making tiny , reliable and heat-resistant capacitors out of tantalum .
but 10 years ago the united nations accused the company of using tantalum from war-torn regions of congo and h.c. starck 's reputation suffered significantly . after the accusations became public , the company began cooperating with the united nations and re-evaluated its coltan acquisition process .
starck now does not purchase any tantalum from africa . " while working through everything together with the un panel , we found out , that not every retailer had told us the truth concerning the material 's origin - despite assuring otherwise , " said manfred buetefisch , a company spokesperson .
" that 's when we realized that - seeing the ongoing war in east africa and the drc - that they are not reliable partners for us , and that we can not buy any material there anymore . " companies like h.c. stark are now banking on being able to rely more and more on african coltan .
the company already bought a nrd rwanda , a small mining company in rwanda .
soon , every one of its deliveries will be certified by the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources in hannover . rock cuttings for the license have already been already charted and included in frank melcher 's database .
by taking random control samples the geologist can now verify whether coltan was taken from the company 's mine in rwanda . " this is of course an ideal case : a company investing in the local mining industry , importing the coltan on its own and making sure that it is no illegally mined material infecting the trading chain , " melcher said . certification is slow moving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coltan is often separated from other rocks by hand one year ago the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources invited all 10 rwandan mining companies for a certification workshop .
the companies ' chief executives were reserved in the beginning but four companies joined nrd rwanda and have signed up for the testing procedures . industry analysts have said that the new practice may pressure african coltan-exporting countries to clean up their mining practices on their own , without relying on harsher external policies . " this might limit corruption , violence and other conflicts fought over coltan and other resources , " said peter eigen of the ngo transparency international .
" once the companies voluntarily agree to cooperate , it 's easier to make a point rather than trying to boycott these raw materials or subject them to certain conditions . " but first , the hannover geologists have to adapt their methods to the industry in the congo .
and they all know that it 's a far cry from the way things work in rwanda to the unstable situation in the democratic republic of the congo . while german scientists say getting congo and china to adopt their methods will be difficult , they said they are confident their process change coltan mining in the long term .
while they are willing to provide the fingerprinting system , they say that the certification chain must be located in africa to be most effective , and that its implementation remains a local political issue . " there will be a big meeting in nairobi before the end of the year for certification procedures , " melcher said . " we hope that fingerprinting will be part of the measures that they take .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 13.08.2010 berlin finds its voice at the new speaker 's corner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is no longer the only european capital with a speaker 's corner .
a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 13.08.2010 donations in germany frighteningly low as pakistan relief grows critical großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans donors may not be aware how dire the need is with 6 million lives on the line in pakistan , german relief organizations are struggling to find private donations .
they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .
donors worry funds will fall into the wrong hands sandra bulling of care deutschland-luxemburg told deutsche welle that pakistan 's reputation for corruption and supporting islamist terrorists scared many potential donors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions are inaccessible to aid workers " we have received calls from private donors who asked us if the money they donate will reach the people in need and wo n't go to the government .
what they hear in the media is that the pakistani government might be corrupt , that money will vanish down government channels , " bulling said .
" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "
the wrong time for a catastrophe care and other aid organizations believe the lack of donations to pakistan also has to do with the timing of the disaster .
bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .
not only are many germans now away on summer holiday - away from the media and their bank accounts - but many are afflicted by " donor fatigue , " according to svenja koch of the red cross .
" we 've had a summer of catastrophes .
from the oil-soaked pelicans in the gulf of mexico to the love parade tragedy to the floods in saxony to the wildfires in russia , " koch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods have displaced an estimated 13 million people 6 million need relief to survive the un has warned that the disaster is far from over and that dams in the southern sindh province could burst in coming days , leading to further flooding .
so far , islamabad has confirmed 1,343 deaths , with over 1,000 in the northwestern khyber-pakhtunkhwa province alone .
the un estimates a death toll of over 1,600 .
pakistan says that between 15 and 20 million residents have been affected by the floods .
the un estimates that 6 million people will be dependent on relief aid for survival , many of whom have been cut off by flooded roads and collapsed bridges according to oxfam germany chief ralf bendix , the relatively low number of causalities in pakistan can be dangerously misleading to potential donors given the precarious position of millions of survivors .
" in the other disasters one hundred thousand died immediately .
obviously it 's easier to mobilize the attention of the public and the government when there 's a high number of casualities than it is when you tell them there will be many more deaths if nothing is done , " he said .
pakistan slowly moving to action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief supplies are running out the pakistani government friday announced plans to intensify its own rescue and aid efforts for flood victims .
after visiting affected regions , prime minister yousuf raza gilani said " the extent of total damage to life , property , cattle head and infrastructure may be far more than what the initial estimates suggested . "
the premier and president asif ali zardari - who has come under massive criticism for making two european trips during the disaster - agreed that " a massive mobilization of resources including budgetary re-prioritization may be required , " according to a statement from the presidential palace .

they say donors are less generous in summer and that many germans fear their donations will go astray . german relief organizations are struggling to collect private donations amid an increasingly desperate situation in flood-stricken pakistan .
the organizations believe germany 's negative view of pakistan - and poor timing - to be responsible for the giving shortage .
the german government announced wednesday it had doubled its emergency relief pledge to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.8 million -rrb- in view of a united nations appeal for $ 460 million to provide aid to 6 million flood victims .
yet , private donations to charitable organizations in germany remain frighteningly low - despite an announcement by the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that pakistan ’ s flood disaster had eclipsed the scale of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami , the 2005 earthquake in pakistan and the january 2010 earthquake in haiti put together .
so far , german relief alliances deutschland hilft and entwicklung hilft say they have collected a total of 620,000 euros for pakistan - compared to 20.1 million euros two weeks after the haiti earthquake disaster .
donors worry funds will fall into the wrong hands sandra bulling of care deutschland-luxemburg told deutsche welle that pakistan 's reputation for corruption and supporting islamist terrorists scared many potential donors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many regions are inaccessible to aid workers " we have received calls from private donors who asked us if the money they donate will reach the people in need and wo n't go to the government .
what they hear in the media is that the pakistani government might be corrupt , that money will vanish down government channels , " bulling said .
" you hear a lot of bad news about pakistan , you hear about the taliban , you hear about corruption , but when you look at the people in need , it does n't matter for them , because it 's people who are affected and need help , " she said .
" we can only confirm to donors that the money they give us goes directly to our beneficiaries and to the people in need . "
the wrong time for a catastrophe care and other aid organizations believe the lack of donations to pakistan also has to do with the timing of the disaster .
bulling says donors are most generous around christmas , which partly explains why private donations for haiti were so high .
not only are many germans now away on summer holiday - away from the media and their bank accounts - but many are afflicted by " donor fatigue , " according to svenja koch of the red cross .
" we 've had a summer of catastrophes .
from the oil-soaked pelicans in the gulf of mexico to the love parade tragedy to the floods in saxony to the wildfires in russia , " koch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the floods have displaced an estimated 13 million people 6 million need relief to survive the un has warned that the disaster is far from over and that dams in the southern sindh province could burst in coming days , leading to further flooding .
so far , islamabad has confirmed 1,343 deaths , with over 1,000 in the northwestern khyber-pakhtunkhwa province alone .
the un estimates a death toll of over 1,600 .
pakistan says that between 15 and 20 million residents have been affected by the floods .
the un estimates that 6 million people will be dependent on relief aid for survival , many of whom have been cut off by flooded roads and collapsed bridges according to oxfam germany chief ralf bendix , the relatively low number of causalities in pakistan can be dangerously misleading to potential donors given the precarious position of millions of survivors .
" in the other disasters one hundred thousand died immediately .
obviously it 's easier to mobilize the attention of the public and the government when there 's a high number of casualities than it is when you tell them there will be many more deaths if nothing is done , " he said .
pakistan slowly moving to action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief supplies are running out the pakistani government friday announced plans to intensify its own rescue and aid efforts for flood victims .
after visiting affected regions , prime minister yousuf raza gilani said " the extent of total damage to life , property , cattle head and infrastructure may be far more than what the initial estimates suggested . "
the premier and president asif ali zardari - who has come under massive criticism for making two european trips during the disaster - agreed that " a massive mobilization of resources including budgetary re-prioritization may be required , " according to a statement from the presidential palace .

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 13.08.2010 america taking risks , germany taking heed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy continued to shed jobs in july , generating fears of another downturn in the united states , the dream of perpetually rising living standards has bottomed out in growing unemployment .
across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

the proposal for the 2011 budget totaled 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- , more than 3.6 billion euros less what had been requested by the european commission , the bloc 's executive body .
however the total budget was still a 2.9 increase from the previous year 's funding .
the joint statement on the budget cited the tough position many member states are currently in , while maintaining that the more modest budget would ensure " appropriate funding for the priorities of the european union , in particular economic recovery . "
social projects , staff lose out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron said the eu budget should be shrinking , not growing most of the cuts came from the commission 's funding for social projects in poorer regions , as well as investment in turning the eu into a " global player , " at a time when the bloc is spending billions in the establishment of a worldwide diplomatic service .
member states also sought to slow down a pay raise for tens of thousands of eu staff , a topic currently the subject of a lawsuit in the european court of justice .
the commission had requested a 4.5-percent increase , but governments reduced that to 2.5 percent .
seven eu members - austria , the czech republic , denmark , finland , the netherlands , sweden and the united kingdom - voted against the proposal .
speaking at a press conference in london on thursday , british prime minister david cameron said the eu 's operating budget should be " reduced rather than increased . "
" we can not ask members of the public to pay more in the uk and have to pay more in europe as well , " cameron said , vowing to fight budget increases at a summit of eu leaders in brussels on september 16 .
fight ahead in parliament member states , which are represented in the council of the european union , the effective upper legislative body , are now to debate the budget proposals with the european parliament .
" it is not our intention to redo our numbers , " patrizio fiorilli , spokesman for eu budget chief janusz lewandowski , told news agency agence france-presse . instead the commission would hope to win over european legislators in a 21-day reconciliation process to begin on october 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament is next to debate the budget lewandowski has been under heavy pressure from cash-strapped member states to present a more thrifty version of the eu budget , which many euroskeptics see as little more than a black hole of bureaucracy .
his answer was a proposed long-term reduction in direct contributions from member states totaling 30 to 40 billion euros per year from 2014 .
the consequent funding gap would be filled by directly taxing eu citizens , or by ending a 26-year-old rebate paid yearly to the united kingdom because it receives relatively little agricultural subsidies .

a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

a public-speaking trainer has now planted one in berlin .
for a city so used to creative art , it 's a strange new challenge for artistic berliners . berlin can be a bewildering kaleidoscope of seat-of-your-pants creativity , with thousands of live-shows in all kinds of cross-bred formats happening every year .
most of it is terrible , of course - meandering , pretentious , unprepared , morally meaningless , or just fuelled by a directionless urge to escape the horrors of employment .
i am not being sour - the city 's live-art world is pure and liberating .
what berlin provides , and this makes the city so great , is an atmosphere of acceptance that all amateur artistic endeavors are valuable .
it does n't matter if you do n't have anything to say , as long as you say it , preferably with a techno soundtrack while wearing too much black eyeliner and a torn tutu .
but a speaker 's corner is different .
with public speaking , the performance aesthetic is stripped back , exposing the content .
it 's not about what you can do , but whether you have a point .
a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .

barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .

a plastic crate was set up as a soap-box , a sign was planted next to it , and the speaker 's corner , conceived by speaking coach and theater director peter lueder , was born .
it is tucked away in the newly inaugurated tempelhof park , the immense expanse of unkempt grass and strips of worn concrete that used to be the famous airport 's airfield , and it is free all the time for you to have your say .
opening event public speaking is so much more confrontational than blogging .
it takes a lot of courage to stand on a box and speak your mind in a public park .
courage , or righteous anger .
or just mental instability .
whatever the motivation , the results are almost always entertaining , particularly when the speaker begins to strip .
barefooted , slightly scrawny and scraggly with his blond beard and linen suit , steffen was nearing the end of his plea for more " feeling " in society - a long ramble that included an extended metaphor with an upside-down german flag and some thoughts on the national anthem - when he began to undress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live art in berlin is one thing - having a point is another there was a ruffle of collective tension that passed through the audience - people shifted on their deckchairs , judges glanced uncertainly towards the organizers , parents wondered whether this was really turning out to be an ideal sunday afternoon activity .
but it was all right for me .
watching steffen 's unhinged rant approach its climax - he was someone who had obviously been through a lot - had already made me worry that he might set himself on fire as a finale , so the less horrific prospect of seeing him nude was a relief - if anything .
in the event , steffen merely put on a pair of shorts and a rough , patchwork waistcoat , and enthusiastic applause followed .
dramatic amateurs the point of a speaker 's corner is the celebration of democracy .
these were n't people much used to speaking in public , or even being listened to much .
this was one speaker 's theme : paula , a local 13-year-old , demanded lowering the voting age and called out for youth to be given a voice .
even the professional performers - an actor and a cabaret artist were among the 10 speakers - faced a different experience without the safety of prepared material .
and despite the competitive , boisterous nature of the event , this was nothing like a poetry slam .
there was matthias , a 38-year-old juggler with the charisma of a dentist .
in a good way - the sort of dentist who likes sarcastic jokes and maintaining an air of dry superiority .
matthias told a story about a boiled egg that segued into a scene about a child making too much noise in a courtyard and an ensuing row between neighbors .
unfortunately his time ran out before the point came into view , but the spectators appreciated it nonetheless .
one man and his dog winfried , who mounted the stage with his small , excitable dog , did have a point , even if it was on the reactionary side .
all panama hat and self-confidence , winfried suggested that women had not reached equality in the professional world because they had been hogging all the child-raising to themselves .
his dog made several attempts to jump off the stage .
as the event unfolded , there was a noticeable change in the audience - the ruffle of uncertainty about steffen turned into enthusiasm .
the idea of a speaker 's corner began to fire the imagination , and new participants began to trickle out of the audience .
it was all encapsulated by a man with a sunny character who appeared just to say he had opposed the closure of tempelhof airport - an issue that tormented berlin for quite some time - but now loved the new park .
so used to accepting amateur art , it 'll be interesting to see how berlin embraces the challenge of amateur politics .
ben knight is petrified by the thought of speaking in public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 13.08.2010 america taking risks , germany taking heed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us economy continued to shed jobs in july , generating fears of another downturn in the united states , the dream of perpetually rising living standards has bottomed out in growing unemployment .
across the atlantic , german aversion to risk may bring europe 's largest economy out of the recession . during the g20 economic summit in toronto last june , washington and berlin came to an impasse about how to deal with the economic crisis .
german chancellor angela merkel campaigned for savings and budget cuts according to the motto " spend what you have . "
meanwhile , us president barack obama advocated more stimulus money to breath life into a stagnating economy . yet despite the billions of dollars in stimulus aid , the us economy shed 131,000 jobs during the month of july , double the number predicted by economists .
these figures have raised concern that the us could experience a double-dip in which the economy worsens before it gets better .
but in germany unemployment - seasonally adjusted - actually declined by 20,000 , while the latest figures show growth and exports booming , driving europe 's largest economy forward .
the contradictory unemployment numbers across the atlantic reflect deeply rooted historical differences in how the two countries believe a healthy economy should be structured .
american dream , american bubble since america 's establishment , politicians and businessmen have preached a national gospel of social mobility .
anybody could achieve the american dream by diligently applying their life and liberty toward the pursuit of happiness .
but during the 90s , more and more americans began taking short-cuts on their road to wealth .
a post-cold war triumphalism , fuelled by the belief that history had ended in the free market 's favor , inflated the american lifestyle beyond sustainable levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belief in perpetually rising home prices led to a bubble that crippled the entire american economy homeownership became an economic panacea that guaranteed upward social mobility .
people started buying homes in record numbers under the impression that prices could only rise .
and there was plenty of cheap money circulating to ensure that anybody could stake their claim in the american bonanza .
in the whirlwind of economic expansion driven by the booming real estate market , speculators began turning a profit by buying and selling the debt used to finance the american dream .
but wall street was making so much money that the investment bankers forgot a very important economic principle : debts have to be repaid .
" our banks , that 's how they make their money - with consumer debt , " dr. richard freeman , a labor market economist who teaches at harvard university and chairs the national bureau of economic research , told deutsche welle . " some people are making money off the debt , and they will fight to keep that debt . "
the dream grew too big and when the housing bubble finally burst , it turned into a nightmare .
as the debt-laden banking sector teetered on the verge of collapse in 2007 , the easy money of the 90s and early 2000s became harder to acquire .
credit dried up .
the crisis spread from wall street to main street .
and the economy subsequently shed 8.5 million jobs in a little more than two years .
american industry went into crisis mode and began to look for a way to contain hemorrhaging profits .
the solution came at the expense of workers .
" our main response was to get rid of workers as fast as we can , " freeman said .
" companies want to get back to profit building as quick as humanly possibly even if it may hurt the company in the long run . "
risk-averse view from berlin the recession hit germany differently .
as an economy geared toward international as opposed to domestic trade , the crisis primarily impacted the export-industry .
in germany , there was no real estate time bomb waiting to explode in the domestic market . " the real estate market -lsb- in america -rsb- had a psychological impact , " karl brenke , an expert on labor markets and the business cycle at the german institute for economic research , told deutsche welle .
" the real estate will continue to increase in value .
people will always become wealthier .
we did n't have this development in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the weimar republic , hyperinflation eroded people 's wealth and forced them to wait in line for scarce goods history had taught germany important lessons .
two traumas in a single century left deep societal scars that remain today .
during the 1920s , hyperinflation wiped out the middle class , allowing political extremists to feed disenchanted masses with populist rhetoric .
that rhetoric brought a second - and this time total - destruction of the german economy .
" germans may be risk averse because of past experience , " said dr. jennifer hunt , a labor market expert at mcgill university in montreal , canada who is also a member of the research institute for the german department of labor .
" there are people in germany who still remember what it 's like to go hungry . "
the numbers reflect the difference in german and american perspectives on debt and risk-taking . in germany , 43 percent of private households are homeowners , compared to 68 percent in america .
and in 2006 , germany 's average private household debt was just over 100 percent of disposable income , whereas in america it hovered around 140 percent .
but the answer is not simply that germany 's economy did not see as much inflated growth .
companies also reacted differently when the recession finally hit .
as one of the first nation 's in the world to institute a broad social safety net , cutting jobs was not the knee-jerk reaction .
instead of massive layoffs , industry and government utilized a system of short-time work .
workers kept their positions , but their hours were cut .
the german government then subsidized a portion of their lost wages .
according to brenke there was already a work shortage in germany .
companies did n't want to lay people off .
they kept their workers to increase productivity once the recession passed .
chronic problems although germany 's risk-averse economy may cushion it from the current recession , it has not proven to be an engine of stunning economic expansion in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany traditionally has a problem with long-term unemployment the german economy is indeed large .
but it has chronic problems with long-term unemployment and sluggish growth .
these idiosyncrasies are connected with the reintegration of former communist east germany into the west german economy .
" before recession struck unemployment in germany was 7.1 percent and that 's all it has gotten down to , " hunt said .
" i would never consider 7.1 to be an acceptable unemployment rate . "
america 's profit-driven , consumer economy generated steady growth and low unemployment throughout much of the post-cold war era .
the current recession , however , has revealed that much of the growth was debt-inflated hype .
ultimately , the american economy will need a sweeping recalibration of economic behavior before it returns to good health .
" the state is in debt .
the firms and banks are in debt .
private households are in debt , " brenke said .
" society needs to be recapitalized . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 13.08.2010 insurers face mounting catastrophe claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurers began counting the costs of disasters early in the year 2010 is proving a rather expensive year for insurers , as claims mount amid a growing number of natural disasters around the world .
the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss re says it 's expecting massive oil spill claims oil spill claims the impact of catastrophes has been felt by insurers beyond europe as well .
chartis , the property-casualty division of us insurance giant aig , ran up about $ 287 million -lrb- 223 million euros -rrb- in catastrophe costs , including a 23-million-dollar loss on the deepwater horizon oil disaster .
swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .

this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .

zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .

the industry is bracing itself for more catastrophes and a fresh slew of damage claims . a series of catastrophes has hit the globe recently : devastating floods in pakistan , wildfires in russia , china 's mudslides and the deluge of water that has submerged parts of europe , including germany .
while the latest wave of disasters may have induced a spike in insurance claims , the world 's top insurers began counting the costs of the destruction several months ago .
that 's hardly surprising , given many observers have pointed out hardly a month seems to have passed in 2010 without some part of the globe being struck by a random catastrophe - starting with the fierce winter storms that caused extensive damage across europe .
releasing its half-yearly results earlier this month , the world 's biggest reinsurer , munich re , said there have been " a striking accumulation of costly natural catastrophes " in the past few months .
the list of calamities includes major earthquakes in haiti , chile , turkey , costa rica and china , as well april 's volcanic eruption in iceland , which caused ash to drift across europe and brought the region 's air travel industry to a standstill .
also in april , an offshore oil rig leased by london-based energy giant bp exploded in the gulf of mexico , leading to the biggest oil spill and environmental disaster in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the devastating floods in pakistan are among the recent wave of disasters claims hit profit margins munich re has estimated industry damage claims from natural catastrophes alone totalled $ 22 billion -lrb- 17 billion euros -rrb- for the first half of its fiscal year - more than double the first-half averages for the past decade .
despite this , munich re stuck to its full-year goal .
" we aim to earn a profit of over 2 billion euros in 2010 .
that remains ambitious , but it is achievable , " chief executive nikolaus von bomhard said .
this month , europe 's biggest insurer , allianz , which is also based in the southern german city of munich , reported a 46 percent decline in second-quarter net profit after facing claims for natural disasters totalling 255 million euros -lrb- $ 327.87 million -rrb- .
the quarter rounded out a first half that was " marked by exceptionally high natural catastrophe losses , " chief executive michael diekmann said in a statement .
natural disasters had cost the insurance giant € 500 million in the first three months of 2010 .
still , allianz 's operating profit of 3.9 billion euros prompted diekmann to strike a note of optimism .
" we are confident that we can achieve our outlook for operating profit for the entire year of around 7.2 billion euros , with a fluctuation range of plus or minus 500 million euros , " he said in the statement .
hannover re , too , said first-half losses from catastrophes came in at a higher-than-expected 407.6 million euros .
that caused the group 's first-half profits to slump by 28 percent to 310.6 million euros .

swiss re , the world 's second largest reinsurer , said it 's expecting claims from the gulf of mexico oil spill to total 200 million dollars before taxes .
analysts have pointed out that it 's still early for claims for the oil spill , with the inquiries , legal action and the cleanup operation still under way .
zurich-based swiss re has also lifted its estimate for losses from the earthquake in chile to $ 630 million before tax from a previous estimate of $ 500 million .
despite the cost of the disasters , swiss re posted a second-quarter net profit of 853.4 million swiss francs -lrb- € 630.54 million ; $ 810.75 million -rrb- .
spotting the silver lining at the same time , however , insurers like swiss re anticipate some positive fallout from extreme weather events like the ongoing drought in the black earth region of central russia .
the company expects the drought to spur interest in the crop insurance market , as farmers re-evaluate the risk of crop failure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich re says disaster claims for the first half of 2010 were over double the average of the past decade " nobody knows if the weather pattern that we see at the moment can repeat itself next year or just in 20 years , and i think this helps to raise awareness for financial risk management measures , " swiss re director reto j. schneider told reuters in an interview .
the company estimates that 25 percent of russian crops are insured - well below the level of 80 percent seen in the heavily-subsidized us market .
many russian farmers continue to rely on government bailouts when crops fail , although the crop insurance market has grown considerably since 2003 , when the government began encouraging the development the sector .

it has also threatened sanctions against the uk-based carrier .
" easyjet can not hide behind safety regulations for refusing to board passengers who have difficulty moving around , " the french transport ministry said in a statement .
" it must implement solutions adapted to each case , as most companies do .
otherwise it must be sanctioned with the greatest severity . "
the ministry also said that other airlines had already found appropriate solutions .

safety concerns a spokeswoman for easyjet told the french news agency afp that the airline " was already in discussion with the french government to find a solution that is suitable for our passengers without compromising their security . "
the announcement by the french transport ministry comes after three separate incidents , in which paraplegic passengers were not allowed on the plane unaccompanied .

the airline says it is authorized to ask someone to accompany those who need assistance .
in one case , however , the carrier refused to let the disabled passenger on board despite a fellow passenger offering to assist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 13.08.2010 german military cuts to ' put effective end to conscription ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of volunteers would fall to 7,500 the government is reported to be planning to slash military spending , putting an effective end to the institution of mandatory military service .
if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

if the proposals are adopted troop numbers will be cut dramatically . germany is on the verge of cutting its army by more than a third , effectively ending the post-war tradition of mandatory military service , according to a newspaper report published friday .
conscription would be eliminated in all but name under the plan drawn up by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg , the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said .
unnamed government sources said that guttenberg is about to present a plan to reduce the size of the country 's standing army from 250,000 to 165,000 - including some 7,500 volunteers - later this month .
" the plan is seen as having an excellent chance with the coalition 's parliamentary groups , " the newspaper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military face new challenges on lower budgets the government aims to save some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.7 billion -rrb- on defense by 2014 while at the same time adapting the military to meet new security threats .
a reduction in manpower would be accompanied by a " voluntary military service , " effectively ending conscription but retaining its place in the german constitution .
' quick , flexible and nimble ' germany 's military would benefit from the changes , said ulrich kirch , chairman of the armed service personnel lobby group bundeswehr association .
" the bundeswehr must be quick , flexible and nimble and above all , more professional than now , " kirch told daily newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is expected to present the plan this month conservatives within all three government parties - the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the csu and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- - have so far resisted moves to end conscription .
conscription is regarded by some as a virtuous institution in postwar germany , with the presence of ' citizens in uniform ' serving as a bulwark against the military elite that seized control during the nazi period .
until the 1990s , german men were forced to serve in the army for one and a half years from the age of 18 . but young men could claim moral objections to military service , and opt to do civilian national service instead .
since then , mandatory military service - no longer practiced in most european countries - has been shortened several times , with the latest reduction to just six months .
cuts to military spending are also being considered in britain , which aims to trim 20 percent from its defense budget .
analysts have suggested that the number of british army personnel could fall from the current 102,000 to 85,000 .

now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .
stuttgart 21 ' can no longer be stopped ' but in the face of the protests , which have lingered for years in stuttgart , a city known for its wealth , prosperity and order , officials are determined to push the project through .
stuttgart mayor wolfgang schuster was quoted in the stuttgarter nachrichten as saying a moratorium was " unthinkable , " given the time , energy , and money already invested .
he added that those opposed should " not forget that -lsb- stuttgart 21 -rsb- is both democratic and legal .
parliaments on all political levels , and the people of stuttgart , passed the project in 1995 . "
schuster was given vocal support on wednesday by tanja goenner , the transport minister of baden-wuerttemberg , the state of which stuttgart is the capital .
" we believe that this is a very decisive infrastructure project for the future of our state , and for this reason we will not back down , " goenner said on friday in stuttgart , even as protestors gathered at the station in an equally dogged mood .

thousands demonstrated against the opening of the four-billion-euro plan . thousands of people in the western german city of stuttgart came out in protest on friday against the destruction of the city 's main train station .
huge cranes and other construction vehicles had arrived in the early morning hours - accompanied by dozens of police - to begin dismantling the facade of the northern wing .
some 20 activists attempted to blockade the construction zone but were escorted away by police .
others , according to a police spokesman , were heard insulting the workers and disturbing them with noisemakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters call the project the " billion-euro hole " the protests were directed against the so-called " stuttgart 21 " project which entails a huge transformation of the main rail terminus into an underground facility within the next nine years .
the redevelopment will replace the station 's dead-end tracks with through lines in a bid to streamline connections between paris and vienna , which , according to the project 's slogan , will turn stuttgart into " the new heart of europe . "
worthless waste of billions ?
those opposed to stuttgart 21 , meanwhile , see the project as a massive waste of money , referring to it not as the new heart of europe , but rather as the milliardenloch , or " billion-euro hole . "
when the project was agreed in 1995 , the new station was expected to cost 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- , to be shared by germany 's national rail operator , deutsche bahn , the city of stuttgart , and the federal government .
that original estimate has been raised several times since , with costs for the project now expected to amount to 4.1 billion euros - a sum many fear will continue to rise .
well over half of the city 's population is against stuttgart 21 , with a public opinion poll by the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper showing close to 65 percent would vote to stop the project if it were put to a referendum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new main station will allow for through traffic but that 's no longer possible , as the city of stuttgart is not solely responsible for the project or for its costs .
gangolf stocker , who heads the initiative " living in stuttgart " that supports and organizes weekly protests against the reconstruction plans , told deutsche welle that it was " extremely undemocratic " that the people of stuttgart were not allowed to influence the development of their city .
" this must be stopped : it 's that simple , " stocker said . " the future of our city is being determined by a few individuals who are using the people to achieve their own personal motives .
and they 've been lying about the costs from the very beginning .
we have n't seen the last of the ' readjustments ' .
we think it will reach at least eight billion euros .
and that 's eight billion euros for nothing . "
ecological protests criticism of the project does not stop at its escalating costs , however .
thousands of citizens have also objected to ecological ramifications that include the reduction of a main park near the station and the chopping down of nearly 300 trees .
over 19,000 citizens in stuttgart have joined a group to protect the schlossgarten park from being reduced in size and to prevent the trees located on the grounds from being destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents are enraged by more than just high costs the members of the group are also worried that the construction project could result in damage to the city 's water supply and nearby mineral sources , with millions of cubic meters of water required for completion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 13.08.2010 refugee camps to use gas from human waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in three refugee camps in the world have inadequate sanitation facilities energy shortages and poor sanitation are two of the most serious problems in refugee camps .
now engineers say they can solve both problems by harvesting energy from human excrement . environmental engineer eckhard kraft and his team at the university of weimar are designing portable lavatories which harvest methane and make it available for energy .
kraft believes these units may eventually act as a source of fuel for refugee camps around the world , while also helping solve sanitation problems .
" i 'm thinking of using this biogas for cooking purposes , ” kraft said in an interview with broadcaster westdeutscher rundfunk .
the energy could also be used for other purposes , he added . " lighting is also a huge problem in refugee camps .
providing light at night would improve safety . "
it is n't always easy to get people to understand how important hygiene issues are in refugee camps , kraft said .
" it sounds a bit crazy , because first you 've got to feed the people , and make sure they get drinking water .
but the sanitary problem is often neglected , " he said . the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- says that some 2.4 million people around the world are currently living in about 300 refugee camps . unhcr estimates that one third of the refugee camps have inadequate waste disposal and latrine facilities .
proper disposal of human waste is crucial for preventing the spread of disease .
meanwhile , energy shortages mean that cooking rice or other foodstuffs distributed in camps becomes difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a family of five can produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal .
it was discussing issues like these with refugee camp volunteers that first prompted kraft to think about energy harvesting .
" they said that within three or four days , people had used up all the firewood within reach .
so they needed fuel . ”
biofuel production onsite could help reduce costs , as less fuel and firewood would need to be transported into the camps .
according to the unhcr , an average size refugee camp holds about 20,000 people .
kraft says a camp like this needs about 10 of his methane extracting units . the waste produced by a camp 's inhabitants would not provide enough methane to meet all their energy needs , but it would make a significant contribution . germany currently provides the unhcr with mobile water treatment plants for emergency use in camps around the world .
following the earthquake in haiti at the beginning of this year , one of these mobile units provided water to some 75,000 people .
kraft would like to see his energy harvesting lavatories included in the package of emergency treatment units which germany offers .
but so far , it has been difficult to raise the necessary funds to continue research and begin producing the units .
most manufacturers say they need an order of about thousand before it makes sense to start production .
innovative biogas projects are being tested around the world , but they tend to be static units which are not designed to be moved .
in kenya , engineers have started testing units at health clinics .
the biosan project is headed by sibilike makhanu , a professor at masinde muliro university of science and technology in kakamega .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of converting human waste into biogas is gaining attention " large areas of kenya have no running water or experience severe shortages .
this includes refugee camps , schools , hospitals , slum areas in many urban centres and prisons .
schools still use pit latrines and the land has practically been exhausted , " makhanu explained in an interview with deutsche welle .
aside from addressing the shortage of facilities , he explained that recycling this energy " contributes to decreasing global warming from burning methane instead of releasing it into the atmosphere " .
safety concerns while working on the biosan project , makhanu encountered a number of problems .
standing tanks of human waste are potential breeding grounds for maggots and flies .
there are also serious safety and environmental concerns .
the methane gas produced by human waste is both an explosive and an asphyxiation hazard .
" methane gas is odourless and so one would not know that it is leaking , " makhanu explained .
" in large waste treatment plants , a lot of methane gas is released and can even cause air accidents . ”
eckhard kraft believes it is possible to make his methane extraction units safe .
he explains that the gas can be transported away from the site once it has been harvested and stored in a safe facility .
but it has been difficult to get people to accept the idea of using gas taken from latrines .
kraft expects the idea to be accepted more readily in asia , where most people have been cooking with gas before entering the camps . he said more education will be needed in camps in africa , where cooking over a fire is more common .
meanwhile , the idea of converting excrement gathered at refugee camps into biogas , water and fertilizer is gaining attention .
at a refugee camp in earthquake ravaged haiti , energy harvesting toilets used by a family of five were reported to produce an hour of biogas , enough to cook a meal . report by : saroja coelho edited by : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trade unionists have strongly condemned the verdict . a hanover court has approved a planned neo-nazi march in a town in the state of lower saxony this weekend , but prohibited a trade union counter-demonstration from taking place .
right-wing extremists will hold a " funeral march " on saturday in bad nenndorf , where british occupying forces interrogated nazis between 1945 and 1947 , and reportedly abused their detainees .
the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- was planning to march in opposition , and described the administrative court 's decision to stop them as an " incredible ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : counter-demos against neo-nazis are common in germany " a very sad day for civil society , " said a statement from the dgb .
" but also a further incentive for us to proceed yet further against right-wing extremism . "
threat to public order the court decided in favor of the neo-nazi march , as it was organized first and was judged to present less of a threat to public order .
around 1,000 nazi sympathizers are expected , while the dgb said it was expecting up to 2,000 participants .
the large number of participants for both sides caused the schaumburg district court to originally block both demonstrations .
district official ursula mueller-kratz explained that the decision was made because an adequate number of police were not available to ensure safety .
but the hanover administrative court ruled on thursday that a police presence of around 2,000 officers was sufficient to oversee one demonstration .
neo-nazi forces have been commemorating the mistreatment of prisoners in bad nenndorf since 2006 , with the annual events increasing in popularity every year .

trade unionists have strongly condemned the verdict . a hanover court has approved a planned neo-nazi march in a town in the state of lower saxony this weekend , but prohibited a trade union counter-demonstration from taking place .
right-wing extremists will hold a " funeral march " on saturday in bad nenndorf , where british occupying forces interrogated nazis between 1945 and 1947 , and reportedly abused their detainees .
the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- was planning to march in opposition , and described the administrative court 's decision to stop them as an " incredible ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : counter-demos against neo-nazis are common in germany " a very sad day for civil society , " said a statement from the dgb .
" but also a further incentive for us to proceed yet further against right-wing extremism . "
threat to public order the court decided in favor of the neo-nazi march , as it was organized first and was judged to present less of a threat to public order .
around 1,000 nazi sympathizers are expected , while the dgb said it was expecting up to 2,000 participants .
the large number of participants for both sides caused the schaumburg district court to originally block both demonstrations .
district official ursula mueller-kratz explained that the decision was made because an adequate number of police were not available to ensure safety .
but the hanover administrative court ruled on thursday that a police presence of around 2,000 officers was sufficient to oversee one demonstration .
neo-nazi forces have been commemorating the mistreatment of prisoners in bad nenndorf since 2006 , with the annual events increasing in popularity every year .
