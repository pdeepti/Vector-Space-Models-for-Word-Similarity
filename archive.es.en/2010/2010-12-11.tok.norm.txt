the report will be presented to german mps . a german government report on the situation in afghanistan says the conflict " can not be won by military means . "
the report , to be presented to mps on monday , presents a comprehensive update on the situation in afghanistan .
politicians had demanded the information in order to make a better decision about whether to withdraw german troops from the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report reveals the truth behind the diplomatic smiles on thursday , german foreign minister guido westerwelle will make the case for prolonging the german mandate in afghanistan .
the decision will be made in parliament at the end of january .
the news magazine focus claims the germans could begin withdrawing troops from afghanistan as early as late 2011 .
military means are not enough the 100-page report covers security , reconstruction and governance , as well as development .
westerwelle had demanded an " unadulterated and honest situation report , " according to the foreign ministry .
the report concludes that the afghan conflict can not be won by military means , and recommends negotiations with insurgents instead .
afghan president hamid karzai comes in for particular criticism .
the reports says that nato 's entire mission is under threat because of the incompetence of karzai 's government .
petraeus asked for german help news magazine der spiegel also reported that the commander of the international security assistance forces -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , general david petraeus , has asked for german support in overseeing the afghan airspace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 11.12.2010 conference seeks eu-wide consensus on homelessness policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts want to find a way to eliminate homelessness in europe despite the generous social welfare of many european states , homelessness continues to be a problem across the continent .
now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "

the protesters waved placards , chanted in unison and banged drums .
they warned against germany becoming a " nuclear toilet " or dumping ground for atomic waste .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the demonstration was peaceful local bishop hans-juergen abromeit told the crowd the storage of the waste was a breach of promise .
he claimed that in the past year the interim storage facility promised it would only accept atomic waste from former east german nuclear power plants .
the bishop said that the issue was shaking the credibility of politics .
the waste due to arrive next week comes from a facility in the southern german city of karlsruhe and from the research vessel " otto hahn . "
speaking to protesters from the local area as well as from berlin and lower saxony , abromeit demanded a more responsible energy policy from the government .
the bishop warned that the responsibility for nuclear policy should not be given over to market forces .
he said it was impossible to be proud whilst germany 's association with nuclear waste continues .
" -lsb- the waste -rsb- poses a massive threat to people , animals and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years , " abromeit said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 11.12.2010 conference seeks eu-wide consensus on homelessness policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts want to find a way to eliminate homelessness in europe despite the generous social welfare of many european states , homelessness continues to be a problem across the continent .
now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.12.2010 germany praises cancun climate agreements großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cancun agreement is not a legally binding treaty german ministers welcomed a historic compromise at international climate negotiations in mexico .
the deal provides billions to developing countries and defers extending emissions cuts under the kyoto protocol . after two weeks of meetings in cancun , officials from 194 countries reached a consensus on several important measures for tackling climate change , despite fears that the talks would end in failure on friday and even early saturday morning . " this is a new era of international cooperation on climate change , " mexican foreign minister patricia espinosa , who chaired the summit of 194 nations , told delegates after the compromise was reached . praise for mexico from germany germany has welcomed the " successful " conclusion to the un summit .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle thanked his mexican counterpart who chaired the summit , saying that patricia espinosa had been " prudent and clever " in the way she led negotiations . german environment minister norbert roettgen echoed his colleague , saying espinosa 's very broad interpretation of un rules was the crowning highlight of impressive conference leadership . bildunterschrift : there were at least 900 natural disasters in 2010 , the warmest year on record westerwelle said in a statement , " cancun has shown that it is possible to achieve a balance of interests between developing and industrialized nations . " " now we must use the momentum to achieve a globally binding climate protection agreement and resolve the open issues , " westerwelle added .
he stressed that germany and the european union would continue to drive this process .
a compromise agreement the meeting does not establish a new global , legally binding treaty to tackle climate change , but it provides some of the essential building blocks bringing that goal significantly closer .
breakthroughs include an acknowledgement of the need for tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , the principle of basing these targets on what science demands and the establishment of a green fund for developing countries .
an ambition to limit global warming to below 2 degrees is also contained in the text , together with a reference to reviewing whether it might be possible to aim for 1.5 degrees .
the latter goal is what many small island states are holding out for , in the fear that a 2-degree rise in temperatures will see their islands submerged by rising sea levels .
only bolivia has publically objected to the text , but its objections were overruled by the summit 's chair .
" we clearly stated and would now like to reiterate that we are opposed to this decision and we feel that there is no consensus for its approval , " said pablo salon , the head of bolivia 's delegation .
bildunterschrift : changes to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , were put off until next year major powers - including the united states , china , india , japan , brazil , saudi arabia and the european union - have emerged as supporters of the draft deal , which resolves key stumbling blocks that threatened to torpedo the past two weeks of negotiations .
" we have seen remarkable progress , " espinosa said .
chief us negotiator todd stern said the deal " while not perfect , is certainly a good basis for moving forward . "
climate fund a key step forward one of the most significant decisions at cancun was the agreement to establish a green fund worth $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- a year that is to assist developing countries in their response to climate change as of 2020 . the idea was originally put forward in copenhagen last year , yet at times it seemed unlikely to gain approval in cancun . negotiators often seemed unable to resolve differences over what to discuss first : whether to create the fund or how it should be managed . greenpeace international climate policy director wendel trio told deutsche welle the decision to establish the fund was a " significant " step forward . providing the finance that developing countries will need to cope with climate change is seen as a major sticking point for unlocking other areas of the talks , such as how they account for their climate actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun has n't set on climate talks - they 'll be more in south africa next year industrialized countries seem to have won out on control of the fund .
their preferred institution , the word bank , will act as a trustee , albeit for a trial period of three years . trio said one of the biggest challenges for the next 12 months would be agreeing upon where the money should come from , as this was left unresolved by the cancun deal . kyoto deferred one delegation after another praised mexico 's stewardship of the negotiations , describing the atmosphere as " transparent , " " inclusive , " " constructive " and the outcome as " balanced . " as chair of the event , espinosa played a vital role in defusing a conflict over the future of the kyoto protocol that had threatened to wreck the talks up until the final hours of negotiations . japan has long objected to the fact that kyoto does nothing to restrain the emissions of china and the united states , the world 's top two polluters . in cancun , japan declared that it would not commit to a second period of kyoto after the first period expires in 2012 , and was eventually joined in this stance by russia and canada . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists have been mostly positive about the climate talks this was unacceptable for developing countries , especially china . for them , kyoto , the only legally binding agreement to date to limit greenhouse gas emissions , is a milestone for recognizing the different responsibilities of rich and poor countries in responding to climate change . the conference 's final text overcame the stand-off by deferring a decision on kyoto 's future to next year . the text suggests that there should be no " gap " between kyoto 's first and second periods , but it also leaves the door open for japan to walk away from the protocol if it wishes . forestry deal forestry groups gave their qualified approval of cancun 's decision on a scheme known as redd , or reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation . " after three years of hard negotiations we have a basis for combating deforestation integrated in an agreement on climate which marks an important step , " said rosalind reeve , from global witness , an organization focused on resource exploitation . redd seeks to reward developing countries for maintaining their forests instead of clearing them for other economic pursuits . green groups cautiously optimistic environmentalists have also been mostly positive of the compromise .
tim gore of the anti-poverty group , oxfam , welcomed the green climate fund and said the draft accord " breathes new life " into the un-sponsored climate talks . still , the deal is less the goal of establishing legally binding emissions cuts , which many countries had set ahead of last year 's summit in copenhagen . " the outcome of cancun climate talks is weak and ineffective but at least a small and fragile lifeline , " friends of the earth uk said in an online statement . author : nathan witkop , in cancun ; gregg benzow , joanna impey -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlusconi said he was confident of victory . despite protests in rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has denounced what he called a campaign of lies and slander , and said he would survive ahead of tuesday 's no-confidence vote in parliament .
berlusconi 's fate depends on the outcome of the vote : if he loses , elections will be called .
he said he was confident of victory , but tuesday 's vote remains on a knife-edge .
a step towards change ?
protesters from across italy streamed to the capital to take part in marches organized by the center-left opposition democratic party -lrb- pd -rrb- under the slogan " the italy that wants to change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini and berlusconi -lrb- r . -rrb- split over scandals berlusconi no longer enjoys an automatic majority in parliament after gianfranco fini , the speaker of the lower house and co-founder of the people of freedom party , broke up the coalition following a string of scandals involving the premier .
fini and his supporters have said the 74-year-old prime minister must resign or they will vote with the opposition against him on tuesday and force him to step down .
but on saturday sixteen mps from berlusconi 's people of freedom party and the breakaway future and freedom group called on fini not to vote against the government and urged him to open discussions with the premier .
berlusconi welcomed the appeal , though fini 's chief lieutenant italo bocchino said the no-confidence motion was looking inevitable .
demonstrators at the protests in rome mocked the premier for scandals involving teenage girls and parties at his villa , while others focused on his legal problems , with slogans such as “ italy will change if berlusconi goes to jail . "
corruption allegations italian prosecutors opened an investigation on friday into allegations by the center-left opposition of attempts to buy votes in parliament ahead of the confidence vote .
" the first priority in italy is to send this government and this premier home , " antonio di pietro , leader of the small italy of values party was quoted as saying .
the knife-edge vote in both houses of parliament could either mean new elections , or that berlusconi bounces back once again .
backed by allies anti-immigration northern league , berlusconi has enough support in the senate , but the vote in the lower house seems less certain .

" as chair of the event , espinosa played a vital role in defusing a conflict over the future of the kyoto protocol that had threatened to wreck the talks up until the final hours of negotiations . japan has long objected to the fact that kyoto does nothing to restrain the emissions of china and the united states , the world 's top two polluters . in cancun , japan declared that it would not commit to a second period of kyoto after the first period expires in 2012 , and was eventually joined in this stance by russia and canada . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists have been mostly positive about the climate talks this was unacceptable for developing countries , especially china . for them , kyoto , the only legally binding agreement to date to limit greenhouse gas emissions , is a milestone for recognizing the different responsibilities of rich and poor countries in responding to climate change . the conference 's final text overcame the stand-off by deferring a decision on kyoto 's future to next year . the text suggests that there should be no " gap " between kyoto 's first and second periods , but it also leaves the door open for japan to walk away from the protocol if it wishes . forestry deal forestry groups gave their qualified approval of cancun 's decision on a scheme known as redd , or reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation . " after three years of hard negotiations we have a basis for combating deforestation integrated in an agreement on climate which marks an important step , " said rosalind reeve , from global witness , an organization focused on resource exploitation . redd seeks to reward developing countries for maintaining their forests instead of clearing them for other economic pursuits . green groups cautiously optimistic environmentalists have also been mostly positive of the compromise .
tim gore of the anti-poverty group , oxfam , welcomed the green climate fund and said the draft accord " breathes new life " into the un-sponsored climate talks . still , the deal is less the goal of establishing legally binding emissions cuts , which many countries had set ahead of last year 's summit in copenhagen . " the outcome of cancun climate talks is weak and ineffective but at least a small and fragile lifeline , " friends of the earth uk said in an online statement . author : nathan witkop , in cancun ; gregg benzow , joanna impey -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlusconi said he was confident of victory . despite protests in rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has denounced what he called a campaign of lies and slander , and said he would survive ahead of tuesday 's no-confidence vote in parliament .
berlusconi 's fate depends on the outcome of the vote : if he loses , elections will be called .
he said he was confident of victory , but tuesday 's vote remains on a knife-edge .
a step towards change ?
protesters from across italy streamed to the capital to take part in marches organized by the center-left opposition democratic party -lrb- pd -rrb- under the slogan " the italy that wants to change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini and berlusconi -lrb- r . -rrb- split over scandals berlusconi no longer enjoys an automatic majority in parliament after gianfranco fini , the speaker of the lower house and co-founder of the people of freedom party , broke up the coalition following a string of scandals involving the premier .
fini and his supporters have said the 74-year-old prime minister must resign or they will vote with the opposition against him on tuesday and force him to step down .
but on saturday sixteen mps from berlusconi 's people of freedom party and the breakaway future and freedom group called on fini not to vote against the government and urged him to open discussions with the premier .
berlusconi welcomed the appeal , though fini 's chief lieutenant italo bocchino said the no-confidence motion was looking inevitable .
demonstrators at the protests in rome mocked the premier for scandals involving teenage girls and parties at his villa , while others focused on his legal problems , with slogans such as “ italy will change if berlusconi goes to jail . "
corruption allegations italian prosecutors opened an investigation on friday into allegations by the center-left opposition of attempts to buy votes in parliament ahead of the confidence vote .
" the first priority in italy is to send this government and this premier home , " antonio di pietro , leader of the small italy of values party was quoted as saying .
the knife-edge vote in both houses of parliament could either mean new elections , or that berlusconi bounces back once again .
backed by allies anti-immigration northern league , berlusconi has enough support in the senate , but the vote in the lower house seems less certain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.12.2010 germany praises cancun climate agreements großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cancun agreement is not a legally binding treaty german ministers welcomed a historic compromise at international climate negotiations in mexico .
the deal provides billions to developing countries and defers extending emissions cuts under the kyoto protocol . after two weeks of meetings in cancun , officials from 194 countries reached a consensus on several important measures for tackling climate change , despite fears that the talks would end in failure on friday and even early saturday morning . " this is a new era of international cooperation on climate change , " mexican foreign minister patricia espinosa , who chaired the summit of 194 nations , told delegates after the compromise was reached . praise for mexico from germany germany has welcomed the " successful " conclusion to the un summit .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle thanked his mexican counterpart who chaired the summit , saying that patricia espinosa had been " prudent and clever " in the way she led negotiations . german environment minister norbert roettgen echoed his colleague , saying espinosa 's very broad interpretation of un rules was the crowning highlight of impressive conference leadership . bildunterschrift : there were at least 900 natural disasters in 2010 , the warmest year on record westerwelle said in a statement , " cancun has shown that it is possible to achieve a balance of interests between developing and industrialized nations . " " now we must use the momentum to achieve a globally binding climate protection agreement and resolve the open issues , " westerwelle added .
he stressed that germany and the european union would continue to drive this process .
a compromise agreement the meeting does not establish a new global , legally binding treaty to tackle climate change , but it provides some of the essential building blocks bringing that goal significantly closer .
breakthroughs include an acknowledgement of the need for tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , the principle of basing these targets on what science demands and the establishment of a green fund for developing countries .
an ambition to limit global warming to below 2 degrees is also contained in the text , together with a reference to reviewing whether it might be possible to aim for 1.5 degrees .
the latter goal is what many small island states are holding out for , in the fear that a 2-degree rise in temperatures will see their islands submerged by rising sea levels .
only bolivia has publically objected to the text , but its objections were overruled by the summit 's chair .
" we clearly stated and would now like to reiterate that we are opposed to this decision and we feel that there is no consensus for its approval , " said pablo salon , the head of bolivia 's delegation .
bildunterschrift : changes to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , were put off until next year major powers - including the united states , china , india , japan , brazil , saudi arabia and the european union - have emerged as supporters of the draft deal , which resolves key stumbling blocks that threatened to torpedo the past two weeks of negotiations .
" we have seen remarkable progress , " espinosa said .
chief us negotiator todd stern said the deal " while not perfect , is certainly a good basis for moving forward . "
climate fund a key step forward one of the most significant decisions at cancun was the agreement to establish a green fund worth $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- a year that is to assist developing countries in their response to climate change as of 2020 . the idea was originally put forward in copenhagen last year , yet at times it seemed unlikely to gain approval in cancun . negotiators often seemed unable to resolve differences over what to discuss first : whether to create the fund or how it should be managed . greenpeace international climate policy director wendel trio told deutsche welle the decision to establish the fund was a " significant " step forward . providing the finance that developing countries will need to cope with climate change is seen as a major sticking point for unlocking other areas of the talks , such as how they account for their climate actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun has n't set on climate talks - they 'll be more in south africa next year industrialized countries seem to have won out on control of the fund .
their preferred institution , the word bank , will act as a trustee , albeit for a trial period of three years . trio said one of the biggest challenges for the next 12 months would be agreeing upon where the money should come from , as this was left unresolved by the cancun deal . kyoto deferred one delegation after another praised mexico 's stewardship of the negotiations , describing the atmosphere as " transparent , " " inclusive , " " constructive " and the outcome as " balanced . " as chair of the event , espinosa played a vital role in defusing a conflict over the future of the kyoto protocol that had threatened to wreck the talks up until the final hours of negotiations . japan has long objected to the fact that kyoto does nothing to restrain the emissions of china and the united states , the world 's top two polluters . in cancun , japan declared that it would not commit to a second period of kyoto after the first period expires in 2012 , and was eventually joined in this stance by russia and canada . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists have been mostly positive about the climate talks this was unacceptable for developing countries , especially china . for them , kyoto , the only legally binding agreement to date to limit greenhouse gas emissions , is a milestone for recognizing the different responsibilities of rich and poor countries in responding to climate change . the conference 's final text overcame the stand-off by deferring a decision on kyoto 's future to next year . the text suggests that there should be no " gap " between kyoto 's first and second periods , but it also leaves the door open for japan to walk away from the protocol if it wishes . forestry deal forestry groups gave their qualified approval of cancun 's decision on a scheme known as redd , or reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation . " after three years of hard negotiations we have a basis for combating deforestation integrated in an agreement on climate which marks an important step , " said rosalind reeve , from global witness , an organization focused on resource exploitation . redd seeks to reward developing countries for maintaining their forests instead of clearing them for other economic pursuits . green groups cautiously optimistic environmentalists have also been mostly positive of the compromise .
tim gore of the anti-poverty group , oxfam , welcomed the green climate fund and said the draft accord " breathes new life " into the un-sponsored climate talks . still , the deal is less the goal of establishing legally binding emissions cuts , which many countries had set ahead of last year 's summit in copenhagen . " the outcome of cancun climate talks is weak and ineffective but at least a small and fragile lifeline , " friends of the earth uk said in an online statement . author : nathan witkop , in cancun ; gregg benzow , joanna impey -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protesters waved placards , chanted in unison and banged drums .
they warned against germany becoming a " nuclear toilet " or dumping ground for atomic waste .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the demonstration was peaceful local bishop hans-juergen abromeit told the crowd the storage of the waste was a breach of promise .
he claimed that in the past year the interim storage facility promised it would only accept atomic waste from former east german nuclear power plants .
the bishop said that the issue was shaking the credibility of politics .
the waste due to arrive next week comes from a facility in the southern german city of karlsruhe and from the research vessel " otto hahn . "
speaking to protesters from the local area as well as from berlin and lower saxony , abromeit demanded a more responsible energy policy from the government .
the bishop warned that the responsibility for nuclear policy should not be given over to market forces .
he said it was impossible to be proud whilst germany 's association with nuclear waste continues .
" -lsb- the waste -rsb- poses a massive threat to people , animals and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years , " abromeit said .
further protests planned the nuclear waste transport is due to set off from the southern french research center cadarache at the start of next week and should arrive in the german facility in lubmin a few days later .
police estimated that only around 850 people had come along to the peaceful demonstration , but the protesters themselves said the number was much higher - between 2,000 and 2,500 people .
among those present was the state premier of mecklenburg-pomerania erwin sellering .
protesters have said they are planning to stage vigils , sit-ins and other protest actions over the coming days .

berlusconi said he was confident of victory . despite protests in rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has denounced what he called a campaign of lies and slander , and said he would survive ahead of tuesday 's no-confidence vote in parliament .
berlusconi 's fate depends on the outcome of the vote : if he loses , elections will be called .
he said he was confident of victory , but tuesday 's vote remains on a knife-edge .
a step towards change ?
protesters from across italy streamed to the capital to take part in marches organized by the center-left opposition democratic party -lrb- pd -rrb- under the slogan " the italy that wants to change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini and berlusconi -lrb- r . -rrb- split over scandals berlusconi no longer enjoys an automatic majority in parliament after gianfranco fini , the speaker of the lower house and co-founder of the people of freedom party , broke up the coalition following a string of scandals involving the premier .
fini and his supporters have said the 74-year-old prime minister must resign or they will vote with the opposition against him on tuesday and force him to step down .
but on saturday sixteen mps from berlusconi 's people of freedom party and the breakaway future and freedom group called on fini not to vote against the government and urged him to open discussions with the premier .
berlusconi welcomed the appeal , though fini 's chief lieutenant italo bocchino said the no-confidence motion was looking inevitable .
demonstrators at the protests in rome mocked the premier for scandals involving teenage girls and parties at his villa , while others focused on his legal problems , with slogans such as “ italy will change if berlusconi goes to jail . "
corruption allegations italian prosecutors opened an investigation on friday into allegations by the center-left opposition of attempts to buy votes in parliament ahead of the confidence vote .
" the first priority in italy is to send this government and this premier home , " antonio di pietro , leader of the small italy of values party was quoted as saying .
the knife-edge vote in both houses of parliament could either mean new elections , or that berlusconi bounces back once again .
backed by allies anti-immigration northern league , berlusconi has enough support in the senate , but the vote in the lower house seems less certain .

the deal provides billions to developing countries and defers extending emissions cuts under the kyoto protocol . after two weeks of meetings in cancun , officials from 194 countries reached a consensus on several important measures for tackling climate change , despite fears that the talks would end in failure on friday and even early saturday morning . " this is a new era of international cooperation on climate change , " mexican foreign minister patricia espinosa , who chaired the summit of 194 nations , told delegates after the compromise was reached . praise for mexico from germany germany has welcomed the " successful " conclusion to the un summit .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle thanked his mexican counterpart who chaired the summit , saying that patricia espinosa had been " prudent and clever " in the way she led negotiations . german environment minister norbert roettgen echoed his colleague , saying espinosa 's very broad interpretation of un rules was the crowning highlight of impressive conference leadership . bildunterschrift : there were at least 900 natural disasters in 2010 , the warmest year on record westerwelle said in a statement , " cancun has shown that it is possible to achieve a balance of interests between developing and industrialized nations . " " now we must use the momentum to achieve a globally binding climate protection agreement and resolve the open issues , " westerwelle added .
he stressed that germany and the european union would continue to drive this process .
a compromise agreement the meeting does not establish a new global , legally binding treaty to tackle climate change , but it provides some of the essential building blocks bringing that goal significantly closer .
breakthroughs include an acknowledgement of the need for tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , the principle of basing these targets on what science demands and the establishment of a green fund for developing countries .
an ambition to limit global warming to below 2 degrees is also contained in the text , together with a reference to reviewing whether it might be possible to aim for 1.5 degrees .
the latter goal is what many small island states are holding out for , in the fear that a 2-degree rise in temperatures will see their islands submerged by rising sea levels .
only bolivia has publically objected to the text , but its objections were overruled by the summit 's chair .
" we clearly stated and would now like to reiterate that we are opposed to this decision and we feel that there is no consensus for its approval , " said pablo salon , the head of bolivia 's delegation .
bildunterschrift : changes to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , were put off until next year major powers - including the united states , china , india , japan , brazil , saudi arabia and the european union - have emerged as supporters of the draft deal , which resolves key stumbling blocks that threatened to torpedo the past two weeks of negotiations .
" we have seen remarkable progress , " espinosa said .
chief us negotiator todd stern said the deal " while not perfect , is certainly a good basis for moving forward . "
climate fund a key step forward one of the most significant decisions at cancun was the agreement to establish a green fund worth $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- a year that is to assist developing countries in their response to climate change as of 2020 . the idea was originally put forward in copenhagen last year , yet at times it seemed unlikely to gain approval in cancun . negotiators often seemed unable to resolve differences over what to discuss first : whether to create the fund or how it should be managed . greenpeace international climate policy director wendel trio told deutsche welle the decision to establish the fund was a " significant " step forward . providing the finance that developing countries will need to cope with climate change is seen as a major sticking point for unlocking other areas of the talks , such as how they account for their climate actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun has n't set on climate talks - they 'll be more in south africa next year industrialized countries seem to have won out on control of the fund .
their preferred institution , the word bank , will act as a trustee , albeit for a trial period of three years . trio said one of the biggest challenges for the next 12 months would be agreeing upon where the money should come from , as this was left unresolved by the cancun deal . kyoto deferred one delegation after another praised mexico 's stewardship of the negotiations , describing the atmosphere as " transparent , " " inclusive , " " constructive " and the outcome as " balanced . " as chair of the event , espinosa played a vital role in defusing a conflict over the future of the kyoto protocol that had threatened to wreck the talks up until the final hours of negotiations . japan has long objected to the fact that kyoto does nothing to restrain the emissions of china and the united states , the world 's top two polluters . in cancun , japan declared that it would not commit to a second period of kyoto after the first period expires in 2012 , and was eventually joined in this stance by russia and canada . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists have been mostly positive about the climate talks this was unacceptable for developing countries , especially china . for them , kyoto , the only legally binding agreement to date to limit greenhouse gas emissions , is a milestone for recognizing the different responsibilities of rich and poor countries in responding to climate change . the conference 's final text overcame the stand-off by deferring a decision on kyoto 's future to next year . the text suggests that there should be no " gap " between kyoto 's first and second periods , but it also leaves the door open for japan to walk away from the protocol if it wishes . forestry deal forestry groups gave their qualified approval of cancun 's decision on a scheme known as redd , or reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation . " after three years of hard negotiations we have a basis for combating deforestation integrated in an agreement on climate which marks an important step , " said rosalind reeve , from global witness , an organization focused on resource exploitation . redd seeks to reward developing countries for maintaining their forests instead of clearing them for other economic pursuits . green groups cautiously optimistic environmentalists have also been mostly positive of the compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 11.12.2010 conference seeks eu-wide consensus on homelessness policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts want to find a way to eliminate homelessness in europe despite the generous social welfare of many european states , homelessness continues to be a problem across the continent .
now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.12.2010 germany praises cancun climate agreements großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cancun agreement is not a legally binding treaty german ministers welcomed a historic compromise at international climate negotiations in mexico .
the deal provides billions to developing countries and defers extending emissions cuts under the kyoto protocol . after two weeks of meetings in cancun , officials from 194 countries reached a consensus on several important measures for tackling climate change , despite fears that the talks would end in failure on friday and even early saturday morning . " this is a new era of international cooperation on climate change , " mexican foreign minister patricia espinosa , who chaired the summit of 194 nations , told delegates after the compromise was reached . praise for mexico from germany germany has welcomed the " successful " conclusion to the un summit .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle thanked his mexican counterpart who chaired the summit , saying that patricia espinosa had been " prudent and clever " in the way she led negotiations . german environment minister norbert roettgen echoed his colleague , saying espinosa 's very broad interpretation of un rules was the crowning highlight of impressive conference leadership . bildunterschrift : there were at least 900 natural disasters in 2010 , the warmest year on record westerwelle said in a statement , " cancun has shown that it is possible to achieve a balance of interests between developing and industrialized nations . " " now we must use the momentum to achieve a globally binding climate protection agreement and resolve the open issues , " westerwelle added .
he stressed that germany and the european union would continue to drive this process .
a compromise agreement the meeting does not establish a new global , legally binding treaty to tackle climate change , but it provides some of the essential building blocks bringing that goal significantly closer .
breakthroughs include an acknowledgement of the need for tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , the principle of basing these targets on what science demands and the establishment of a green fund for developing countries .
an ambition to limit global warming to below 2 degrees is also contained in the text , together with a reference to reviewing whether it might be possible to aim for 1.5 degrees .
the latter goal is what many small island states are holding out for , in the fear that a 2-degree rise in temperatures will see their islands submerged by rising sea levels .
only bolivia has publically objected to the text , but its objections were overruled by the summit 's chair .
" we clearly stated and would now like to reiterate that we are opposed to this decision and we feel that there is no consensus for its approval , " said pablo salon , the head of bolivia 's delegation .
bildunterschrift : changes to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , were put off until next year major powers - including the united states , china , india , japan , brazil , saudi arabia and the european union - have emerged as supporters of the draft deal , which resolves key stumbling blocks that threatened to torpedo the past two weeks of negotiations .
" we have seen remarkable progress , " espinosa said .
chief us negotiator todd stern said the deal " while not perfect , is certainly a good basis for moving forward . "
climate fund a key step forward one of the most significant decisions at cancun was the agreement to establish a green fund worth $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- a year that is to assist developing countries in their response to climate change as of 2020 . the idea was originally put forward in copenhagen last year , yet at times it seemed unlikely to gain approval in cancun . negotiators often seemed unable to resolve differences over what to discuss first : whether to create the fund or how it should be managed . greenpeace international climate policy director wendel trio told deutsche welle the decision to establish the fund was a " significant " step forward . providing the finance that developing countries will need to cope with climate change is seen as a major sticking point for unlocking other areas of the talks , such as how they account for their climate actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun has n't set on climate talks - they 'll be more in south africa next year industrialized countries seem to have won out on control of the fund .
their preferred institution , the word bank , will act as a trustee , albeit for a trial period of three years . trio said one of the biggest challenges for the next 12 months would be agreeing upon where the money should come from , as this was left unresolved by the cancun deal . kyoto deferred one delegation after another praised mexico 's stewardship of the negotiations , describing the atmosphere as " transparent , " " inclusive , " " constructive " and the outcome as " balanced . " as chair of the event , espinosa played a vital role in defusing a conflict over the future of the kyoto protocol that had threatened to wreck the talks up until the final hours of negotiations . japan has long objected to the fact that kyoto does nothing to restrain the emissions of china and the united states , the world 's top two polluters . in cancun , japan declared that it would not commit to a second period of kyoto after the first period expires in 2012 , and was eventually joined in this stance by russia and canada . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists have been mostly positive about the climate talks this was unacceptable for developing countries , especially china . for them , kyoto , the only legally binding agreement to date to limit greenhouse gas emissions , is a milestone for recognizing the different responsibilities of rich and poor countries in responding to climate change . the conference 's final text overcame the stand-off by deferring a decision on kyoto 's future to next year . the text suggests that there should be no " gap " between kyoto 's first and second periods , but it also leaves the door open for japan to walk away from the protocol if it wishes . forestry deal forestry groups gave their qualified approval of cancun 's decision on a scheme known as redd , or reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation . " after three years of hard negotiations we have a basis for combating deforestation integrated in an agreement on climate which marks an important step , " said rosalind reeve , from global witness , an organization focused on resource exploitation . redd seeks to reward developing countries for maintaining their forests instead of clearing them for other economic pursuits . green groups cautiously optimistic environmentalists have also been mostly positive of the compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 11.12.2010 conference seeks eu-wide consensus on homelessness policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts want to find a way to eliminate homelessness in europe despite the generous social welfare of many european states , homelessness continues to be a problem across the continent .
now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 11.12.2010 conference seeks eu-wide consensus on homelessness policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts want to find a way to eliminate homelessness in europe despite the generous social welfare of many european states , homelessness continues to be a problem across the continent .
now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "

berlusconi said he was confident of victory . despite protests in rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has denounced what he called a campaign of lies and slander , and said he would survive ahead of tuesday 's no-confidence vote in parliament .
berlusconi 's fate depends on the outcome of the vote : if he loses , elections will be called .
he said he was confident of victory , but tuesday 's vote remains on a knife-edge .
a step towards change ?
protesters from across italy streamed to the capital to take part in marches organized by the center-left opposition democratic party -lrb- pd -rrb- under the slogan " the italy that wants to change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini and berlusconi -lrb- r . -rrb- split over scandals berlusconi no longer enjoys an automatic majority in parliament after gianfranco fini , the speaker of the lower house and co-founder of the people of freedom party , broke up the coalition following a string of scandals involving the premier .
fini and his supporters have said the 74-year-old prime minister must resign or they will vote with the opposition against him on tuesday and force him to step down .
but on saturday sixteen mps from berlusconi 's people of freedom party and the breakaway future and freedom group called on fini not to vote against the government and urged him to open discussions with the premier .
berlusconi welcomed the appeal , though fini 's chief lieutenant italo bocchino said the no-confidence motion was looking inevitable .
demonstrators at the protests in rome mocked the premier for scandals involving teenage girls and parties at his villa , while others focused on his legal problems , with slogans such as “ italy will change if berlusconi goes to jail . "
corruption allegations italian prosecutors opened an investigation on friday into allegations by the center-left opposition of attempts to buy votes in parliament ahead of the confidence vote .
" the first priority in italy is to send this government and this premier home , " antonio di pietro , leader of the small italy of values party was quoted as saying .
the knife-edge vote in both houses of parliament could either mean new elections , or that berlusconi bounces back once again .
backed by allies anti-immigration northern league , berlusconi has enough support in the senate , but the vote in the lower house seems less certain .

the protesters waved placards , chanted in unison and banged drums .
they warned against germany becoming a " nuclear toilet " or dumping ground for atomic waste .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the demonstration was peaceful local bishop hans-juergen abromeit told the crowd the storage of the waste was a breach of promise .
he claimed that in the past year the interim storage facility promised it would only accept atomic waste from former east german nuclear power plants .
the bishop said that the issue was shaking the credibility of politics .
the waste due to arrive next week comes from a facility in the southern german city of karlsruhe and from the research vessel " otto hahn . "
speaking to protesters from the local area as well as from berlin and lower saxony , abromeit demanded a more responsible energy policy from the government .
the bishop warned that the responsibility for nuclear policy should not be given over to market forces .
he said it was impossible to be proud whilst germany 's association with nuclear waste continues .
" -lsb- the waste -rsb- poses a massive threat to people , animals and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years , " abromeit said .
further protests planned the nuclear waste transport is due to set off from the southern french research center cadarache at the start of next week and should arrive in the german facility in lubmin a few days later .
police estimated that only around 850 people had come along to the peaceful demonstration , but the protesters themselves said the number was much higher - between 2,000 and 2,500 people .
among those present was the state premier of mecklenburg-pomerania erwin sellering .
protesters have said they are planning to stage vigils , sit-ins and other protest actions over the coming days .

berlusconi said he was confident of victory . despite protests in rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has denounced what he called a campaign of lies and slander , and said he would survive ahead of tuesday 's no-confidence vote in parliament .
berlusconi 's fate depends on the outcome of the vote : if he loses , elections will be called .
he said he was confident of victory , but tuesday 's vote remains on a knife-edge .
a step towards change ?
protesters from across italy streamed to the capital to take part in marches organized by the center-left opposition democratic party -lrb- pd -rrb- under the slogan " the italy that wants to change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini and berlusconi -lrb- r . -rrb- split over scandals berlusconi no longer enjoys an automatic majority in parliament after gianfranco fini , the speaker of the lower house and co-founder of the people of freedom party , broke up the coalition following a string of scandals involving the premier .
fini and his supporters have said the 74-year-old prime minister must resign or they will vote with the opposition against him on tuesday and force him to step down .
but on saturday sixteen mps from berlusconi 's people of freedom party and the breakaway future and freedom group called on fini not to vote against the government and urged him to open discussions with the premier .
berlusconi welcomed the appeal , though fini 's chief lieutenant italo bocchino said the no-confidence motion was looking inevitable .
demonstrators at the protests in rome mocked the premier for scandals involving teenage girls and parties at his villa , while others focused on his legal problems , with slogans such as “ italy will change if berlusconi goes to jail . "
corruption allegations italian prosecutors opened an investigation on friday into allegations by the center-left opposition of attempts to buy votes in parliament ahead of the confidence vote .
" the first priority in italy is to send this government and this premier home , " antonio di pietro , leader of the small italy of values party was quoted as saying .
the knife-edge vote in both houses of parliament could either mean new elections , or that berlusconi bounces back once again .
backed by allies anti-immigration northern league , berlusconi has enough support in the senate , but the vote in the lower house seems less certain .

the decision will be made in parliament at the end of january .
the news magazine focus claims the germans could begin withdrawing troops from afghanistan as early as late 2011 .
military means are not enough the 100-page report covers security , reconstruction and governance , as well as development .
westerwelle had demanded an " unadulterated and honest situation report , " according to the foreign ministry .
the report concludes that the afghan conflict can not be won by military means , and recommends negotiations with insurgents instead .
afghan president hamid karzai comes in for particular criticism .
the reports says that nato 's entire mission is under threat because of the incompetence of karzai 's government .
petraeus asked for german help news magazine der spiegel also reported that the commander of the international security assistance forces -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , general david petraeus , has asked for german support in overseeing the afghan airspace .
the report claims that the german government had attempted to forestall the request , in order to avoid an embarrassing refusal .
berlin is apparently concerned that the mission would be hard to implement , because it would require a new parliamentary mandate .
german chancellor angela merkel praised german troops on saturday .
she said that soldiers abroad were working to promote the security of the country under great personal risk .
" our security is not only being defended within our own country , but also beyond the german borders , " merkel said .

now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 11.12.2010 germany praises cancun climate agreements großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cancun agreement is not a legally binding treaty german ministers welcomed a historic compromise at international climate negotiations in mexico .
the deal provides billions to developing countries and defers extending emissions cuts under the kyoto protocol . after two weeks of meetings in cancun , officials from 194 countries reached a consensus on several important measures for tackling climate change , despite fears that the talks would end in failure on friday and even early saturday morning . " this is a new era of international cooperation on climate change , " mexican foreign minister patricia espinosa , who chaired the summit of 194 nations , told delegates after the compromise was reached . praise for mexico from germany germany has welcomed the " successful " conclusion to the un summit .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle thanked his mexican counterpart who chaired the summit , saying that patricia espinosa had been " prudent and clever " in the way she led negotiations . german environment minister norbert roettgen echoed his colleague , saying espinosa 's very broad interpretation of un rules was the crowning highlight of impressive conference leadership . bildunterschrift : there were at least 900 natural disasters in 2010 , the warmest year on record westerwelle said in a statement , " cancun has shown that it is possible to achieve a balance of interests between developing and industrialized nations . " " now we must use the momentum to achieve a globally binding climate protection agreement and resolve the open issues , " westerwelle added .
he stressed that germany and the european union would continue to drive this process .
a compromise agreement the meeting does not establish a new global , legally binding treaty to tackle climate change , but it provides some of the essential building blocks bringing that goal significantly closer .
breakthroughs include an acknowledgement of the need for tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , the principle of basing these targets on what science demands and the establishment of a green fund for developing countries .
an ambition to limit global warming to below 2 degrees is also contained in the text , together with a reference to reviewing whether it might be possible to aim for 1.5 degrees .
the latter goal is what many small island states are holding out for , in the fear that a 2-degree rise in temperatures will see their islands submerged by rising sea levels .
only bolivia has publically objected to the text , but its objections were overruled by the summit 's chair .
" we clearly stated and would now like to reiterate that we are opposed to this decision and we feel that there is no consensus for its approval , " said pablo salon , the head of bolivia 's delegation .
bildunterschrift : changes to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , were put off until next year major powers - including the united states , china , india , japan , brazil , saudi arabia and the european union - have emerged as supporters of the draft deal , which resolves key stumbling blocks that threatened to torpedo the past two weeks of negotiations .
" we have seen remarkable progress , " espinosa said .
chief us negotiator todd stern said the deal " while not perfect , is certainly a good basis for moving forward . "
climate fund a key step forward one of the most significant decisions at cancun was the agreement to establish a green fund worth $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- a year that is to assist developing countries in their response to climate change as of 2020 . the idea was originally put forward in copenhagen last year , yet at times it seemed unlikely to gain approval in cancun . negotiators often seemed unable to resolve differences over what to discuss first : whether to create the fund or how it should be managed . greenpeace international climate policy director wendel trio told deutsche welle the decision to establish the fund was a " significant " step forward . providing the finance that developing countries will need to cope with climate change is seen as a major sticking point for unlocking other areas of the talks , such as how they account for their climate actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun has n't set on climate talks - they 'll be more in south africa next year industrialized countries seem to have won out on control of the fund .
their preferred institution , the word bank , will act as a trustee , albeit for a trial period of three years . trio said one of the biggest challenges for the next 12 months would be agreeing upon where the money should come from , as this was left unresolved by the cancun deal . kyoto deferred one delegation after another praised mexico 's stewardship of the negotiations , describing the atmosphere as " transparent , " " inclusive , " " constructive " and the outcome as " balanced . " as chair of the event , espinosa played a vital role in defusing a conflict over the future of the kyoto protocol that had threatened to wreck the talks up until the final hours of negotiations . japan has long objected to the fact that kyoto does nothing to restrain the emissions of china and the united states , the world 's top two polluters . in cancun , japan declared that it would not commit to a second period of kyoto after the first period expires in 2012 , and was eventually joined in this stance by russia and canada . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists have been mostly positive about the climate talks this was unacceptable for developing countries , especially china . for them , kyoto , the only legally binding agreement to date to limit greenhouse gas emissions , is a milestone for recognizing the different responsibilities of rich and poor countries in responding to climate change . the conference 's final text overcame the stand-off by deferring a decision on kyoto 's future to next year . the text suggests that there should be no " gap " between kyoto 's first and second periods , but it also leaves the door open for japan to walk away from the protocol if it wishes . forestry deal forestry groups gave their qualified approval of cancun 's decision on a scheme known as redd , or reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation . " after three years of hard negotiations we have a basis for combating deforestation integrated in an agreement on climate which marks an important step , " said rosalind reeve , from global witness , an organization focused on resource exploitation . redd seeks to reward developing countries for maintaining their forests instead of clearing them for other economic pursuits . green groups cautiously optimistic environmentalists have also been mostly positive of the compromise .
tim gore of the anti-poverty group , oxfam , welcomed the green climate fund and said the draft accord " breathes new life " into the un-sponsored climate talks . still , the deal is less the goal of establishing legally binding emissions cuts , which many countries had set ahead of last year 's summit in copenhagen . " the outcome of cancun climate talks is weak and ineffective but at least a small and fragile lifeline , " friends of the earth uk said in an online statement . author : nathan witkop , in cancun ; gregg benzow , joanna impey -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 11.12.2010 conference seeks eu-wide consensus on homelessness policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts want to find a way to eliminate homelessness in europe despite the generous social welfare of many european states , homelessness continues to be a problem across the continent .
now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "

the deal provides billions to developing countries and defers extending emissions cuts under the kyoto protocol . after two weeks of meetings in cancun , officials from 194 countries reached a consensus on several important measures for tackling climate change , despite fears that the talks would end in failure on friday and even early saturday morning . " this is a new era of international cooperation on climate change , " mexican foreign minister patricia espinosa , who chaired the summit of 194 nations , told delegates after the compromise was reached . praise for mexico from germany germany has welcomed the " successful " conclusion to the un summit .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle thanked his mexican counterpart who chaired the summit , saying that patricia espinosa had been " prudent and clever " in the way she led negotiations . german environment minister norbert roettgen echoed his colleague , saying espinosa 's very broad interpretation of un rules was the crowning highlight of impressive conference leadership . bildunterschrift : there were at least 900 natural disasters in 2010 , the warmest year on record westerwelle said in a statement , " cancun has shown that it is possible to achieve a balance of interests between developing and industrialized nations . " " now we must use the momentum to achieve a globally binding climate protection agreement and resolve the open issues , " westerwelle added .
he stressed that germany and the european union would continue to drive this process .
a compromise agreement the meeting does not establish a new global , legally binding treaty to tackle climate change , but it provides some of the essential building blocks bringing that goal significantly closer .
breakthroughs include an acknowledgement of the need for tougher targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , the principle of basing these targets on what science demands and the establishment of a green fund for developing countries .
an ambition to limit global warming to below 2 degrees is also contained in the text , together with a reference to reviewing whether it might be possible to aim for 1.5 degrees .
the latter goal is what many small island states are holding out for , in the fear that a 2-degree rise in temperatures will see their islands submerged by rising sea levels .
only bolivia has publically objected to the text , but its objections were overruled by the summit 's chair .
" we clearly stated and would now like to reiterate that we are opposed to this decision and we feel that there is no consensus for its approval , " said pablo salon , the head of bolivia 's delegation .
bildunterschrift : changes to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 , were put off until next year major powers - including the united states , china , india , japan , brazil , saudi arabia and the european union - have emerged as supporters of the draft deal , which resolves key stumbling blocks that threatened to torpedo the past two weeks of negotiations .
" we have seen remarkable progress , " espinosa said .
chief us negotiator todd stern said the deal " while not perfect , is certainly a good basis for moving forward . "
climate fund a key step forward one of the most significant decisions at cancun was the agreement to establish a green fund worth $ 100 billion -lrb- 70 billion euros -rrb- a year that is to assist developing countries in their response to climate change as of 2020 . the idea was originally put forward in copenhagen last year , yet at times it seemed unlikely to gain approval in cancun . negotiators often seemed unable to resolve differences over what to discuss first : whether to create the fund or how it should be managed . greenpeace international climate policy director wendel trio told deutsche welle the decision to establish the fund was a " significant " step forward . providing the finance that developing countries will need to cope with climate change is seen as a major sticking point for unlocking other areas of the talks , such as how they account for their climate actions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun has n't set on climate talks - they 'll be more in south africa next year industrialized countries seem to have won out on control of the fund .
their preferred institution , the word bank , will act as a trustee , albeit for a trial period of three years . trio said one of the biggest challenges for the next 12 months would be agreeing upon where the money should come from , as this was left unresolved by the cancun deal . kyoto deferred one delegation after another praised mexico 's stewardship of the negotiations , describing the atmosphere as " transparent , " " inclusive , " " constructive " and the outcome as " balanced . " as chair of the event , espinosa played a vital role in defusing a conflict over the future of the kyoto protocol that had threatened to wreck the talks up until the final hours of negotiations . japan has long objected to the fact that kyoto does nothing to restrain the emissions of china and the united states , the world 's top two polluters . in cancun , japan declared that it would not commit to a second period of kyoto after the first period expires in 2012 , and was eventually joined in this stance by russia and canada . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists have been mostly positive about the climate talks this was unacceptable for developing countries , especially china . for them , kyoto , the only legally binding agreement to date to limit greenhouse gas emissions , is a milestone for recognizing the different responsibilities of rich and poor countries in responding to climate change . the conference 's final text overcame the stand-off by deferring a decision on kyoto 's future to next year . the text suggests that there should be no " gap " between kyoto 's first and second periods , but it also leaves the door open for japan to walk away from the protocol if it wishes . forestry deal forestry groups gave their qualified approval of cancun 's decision on a scheme known as redd , or reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation . " after three years of hard negotiations we have a basis for combating deforestation integrated in an agreement on climate which marks an important step , " said rosalind reeve , from global witness , an organization focused on resource exploitation . redd seeks to reward developing countries for maintaining their forests instead of clearing them for other economic pursuits . green groups cautiously optimistic environmentalists have also been mostly positive of the compromise .
tim gore of the anti-poverty group , oxfam , welcomed the green climate fund and said the draft accord " breathes new life " into the un-sponsored climate talks . still , the deal is less the goal of establishing legally binding emissions cuts , which many countries had set ahead of last year 's summit in copenhagen .

the protesters waved placards , chanted in unison and banged drums .
they warned against germany becoming a " nuclear toilet " or dumping ground for atomic waste .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said the demonstration was peaceful local bishop hans-juergen abromeit told the crowd the storage of the waste was a breach of promise .
he claimed that in the past year the interim storage facility promised it would only accept atomic waste from former east german nuclear power plants .
the bishop said that the issue was shaking the credibility of politics .
the waste due to arrive next week comes from a facility in the southern german city of karlsruhe and from the research vessel " otto hahn . "
speaking to protesters from the local area as well as from berlin and lower saxony , abromeit demanded a more responsible energy policy from the government .
the bishop warned that the responsibility for nuclear policy should not be given over to market forces .
he said it was impossible to be proud whilst germany 's association with nuclear waste continues .
" -lsb- the waste -rsb- poses a massive threat to people , animals and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years , " abromeit said .
further protests planned the nuclear waste transport is due to set off from the southern french research center cadarache at the start of next week and should arrive in the german facility in lubmin a few days later .
police estimated that only around 850 people had come along to the peaceful demonstration , but the protesters themselves said the number was much higher - between 2,000 and 2,500 people .
among those present was the state premier of mecklenburg-pomerania erwin sellering .
protesters have said they are planning to stage vigils , sit-ins and other protest actions over the coming days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 11.12.2010 conference seeks eu-wide consensus on homelessness policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts want to find a way to eliminate homelessness in europe despite the generous social welfare of many european states , homelessness continues to be a problem across the continent .
now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "

berlusconi said he was confident of victory . despite protests in rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has denounced what he called a campaign of lies and slander , and said he would survive ahead of tuesday 's no-confidence vote in parliament .
berlusconi 's fate depends on the outcome of the vote : if he loses , elections will be called .
he said he was confident of victory , but tuesday 's vote remains on a knife-edge .
a step towards change ?
protesters from across italy streamed to the capital to take part in marches organized by the center-left opposition democratic party -lrb- pd -rrb- under the slogan " the italy that wants to change . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini and berlusconi -lrb- r . -rrb- split over scandals berlusconi no longer enjoys an automatic majority in parliament after gianfranco fini , the speaker of the lower house and co-founder of the people of freedom party , broke up the coalition following a string of scandals involving the premier .
fini and his supporters have said the 74-year-old prime minister must resign or they will vote with the opposition against him on tuesday and force him to step down .
but on saturday sixteen mps from berlusconi 's people of freedom party and the breakaway future and freedom group called on fini not to vote against the government and urged him to open discussions with the premier .
berlusconi welcomed the appeal , though fini 's chief lieutenant italo bocchino said the no-confidence motion was looking inevitable .
demonstrators at the protests in rome mocked the premier for scandals involving teenage girls and parties at his villa , while others focused on his legal problems , with slogans such as “ italy will change if berlusconi goes to jail . "
corruption allegations italian prosecutors opened an investigation on friday into allegations by the center-left opposition of attempts to buy votes in parliament ahead of the confidence vote .
" the first priority in italy is to send this government and this premier home , " antonio di pietro , leader of the small italy of values party was quoted as saying .
the knife-edge vote in both houses of parliament could either mean new elections , or that berlusconi bounces back once again .
backed by allies anti-immigration northern league , berlusconi has enough support in the senate , but the vote in the lower house seems less certain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 11.12.2010 conference seeks eu-wide consensus on homelessness policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts want to find a way to eliminate homelessness in europe despite the generous social welfare of many european states , homelessness continues to be a problem across the continent .
now leaders in the field are trying to come up with a unified solution for people with no home . experts and field workers in the area of homelessness met in brussels on thursday and friday in the hope of finding common ground on how to tackle homelessness across the european union .
the european consensus conference on homelessness was organized by the belgian eu presidency and co-sponsored by the european commission and the european network of national organizations working with the homeless .
panels of experts attempted to answer six key questions , including how to define homelessness , how to ensure the participation of homeless people in policy decisions , and what elements should be key in an eu-wide strategy .
a seven-member jury will now deliberate over the coming weeks and present a consensus to the european commission , which proposes eu laws , outlining how the bloc can guide the policies of its 27 member states with the goal of eliminating homelessness on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research about the scale of the problem varies across europe lack of data participants and organizers recognized the difficult task at hand , especially in light of the wide gap in data and research into homelessness between regions .
" there is considerable evidence on homelessness in europe , but our knowledge remains very uneven for the lack of data and understanding on some aspects of homelessness , " said eoin o 'sullivan , a lecturer at trinity college in dublin who presented research to the conference .
another obstacle is the financial and economic crisis , which has pushed many middle class people into poverty and has forced european governments to reduce their budgets .
some representatives of eastern and southern european countries were skeptical about their governments ' ability to pay for homelessness programs amid the call for austerity .
profitable investment but juha kaakinen , leader of the finnish national program to reduce long-term homelessness , said getting the homeless off the streets , out of the shelters and into permanent housing is an investment .
" it 's a question of social and human rights , but it 's also a question of economic importance , " he told deutsche welle .
" we have some recent scientific research that shows that ending homelessness , getting permanent solutions for homeless people is very cost-effective . "
the program kaakinen leads for finland began in the 1980s , when the country had approximately 20,000 homeless .
since then the homeless population has been reduced to 8,000 , he said , with 3,000 living without a roof or in emergency shelters .
this has led to an annual savings of 14,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- for each person transitioned into permanent housing .
" this is real money , " kaakinen said .
" and in these times of economic problems … i think we can not afford not to invest in solving homelessness . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has put many people on to the streets .
elusive goal perhaps the greatest obstacle the jury faces is reaching a consensus on homelessness policy - especially one all member states could accept - when the eu is still struggling to agree on multiple other issues .
gilberte eeckhout , director of the pierre d 'angle emergency homeless shelter in brussels , said while she appreciated the goal of the conference , she did not think it would be achieved quickly .
" at the federal level at the moment we have no government in belgium , so i do n't think that there will be a consensus on the european level , " she said .
" what i hope is that step by step there will be something , and what i hope is that it will be for the benefit of those who are homeless . "
