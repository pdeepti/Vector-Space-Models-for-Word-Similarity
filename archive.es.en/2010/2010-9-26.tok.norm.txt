both the report found that political conviction took a backseat to social motivations in the process of radicalization . desire to fit in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many extremists come from dysfunctional families young people are attracted to the feeling of belonging that a group gives them , rather than to the political viewpoints of the group , according to thomas kliche , a political psychology researcher at the university of hamburg . " the ideology is a very second rate ideology in their biography , " he said .
" at that age they do n't even comprehend the reach of these ideas , they just comprehend , ' the group tells me i 'm fine , the group tells me i 'm strong . " ' but not all young people are equally susceptible to the allure of group identity .
nearly all the extremists interviewed came from dysfunctional families . poor family relations can heighten appeal of the group , kliche said . " most offenders do come from broken homes ... or their family is not able to provide them a feeling of security , of warmth , of being welcome , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is where the group steps in . " something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people who radicalize often end up in jail the report also found that many of those interviewed , in addition to having emotionally or structurally disturbed families , had failed to fit in with society in other ways .
their education or career training had been interrupted or unsuccessful , and they felt they needed to compensate for their shortcomings . according the report , a person 's identification with a particular extremist ideology depended more on coincidence and availability that true political conviction . often , the need to fit in led to violence or drug use .
most of the participants had been involved in delinquent behavior before joining a radical scene , leading the author of the report to conclude that so-called " politically motivated crime " often had no real ideological motivation . author : sarah harman editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process . " during the difficult 1990s it sometimes did n't feel right to talk of flowering landscapes , " said merkel , adding that she believed the description was now a reality in many parts of the former east germany . but some gaps between germany 's eastern and western states remain .
pay in the east is lower while unemployment is higher .
as a result , many young people in the east have moved west in search for jobs . the chancellor pointed out that the majority of people had voted in east german elections for parties in favor of joining a united germany under the existing constitution of the west . merkel was deputy spokeswoman of the eastern pre-unification caretaker government under lothar de maiziere . " the situation was completely clear , " she told the magazine .
" the people had no desire to wait , or to pursue some kind of third way .
they wanted german unity .
that was then our political task and we fulfilled it . " merkel said in the interview that the she believed that the solidarity pact , under which the eastern states still receive aid for development from those in the west , would not need to continue beyond its planned phasing-out in 2019 . the chancellor said she believed that the prosperity levels in the eastern states would approach those in the west by that time . " naturally , after that , a financial adjustment will also exist between the states , " merkel said referring to the normal way in which germany 's states , including those in the west , subsidize each other . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .

even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

wolfsburg meanwhile continue their comback , toppling freiburg . hanover and wolfsburg both climbed in the bundesliga soccer table sunday after beating kaiserslautern and freiburg respectively .
in kaiserslautern , hanover 's norwegian international mohammed abdellaoue scored the only goal of the match 33 minutes into the game , putting his team in third place .
after abdellaoue 's goal , hanover allowed kaiserslautern to dominate .
the home team should have equalized on several occasions , but instead leon jessen only hit the post and brazilian defender rodnei squandered a good chance , shooting wide late in the game .
with 13 points after six games , hanover have completed their best-ever start to the season .
hanover goalkeeper florian fromlowitz , formerly of kaiserslautern , said he experienced " mixed emotions " over his team 's victory .
" kaiserslautern is very close to my heart , but i said before the match that we needed to win , " fromlowitz said .
" i am glad that we managed to do that , but after the game i went to kaiserslautern 's goalkeeper coach gerry ehrmann and their goalkeeper tobias sippel and thanked them as they were great to work with when i was still with the club . "

despite a rocky start to the season , the 2009 bundesliga champions are now in sixth place with nine points from six matches .
wolfsburg 's grafite opened the scoring for the home side after 25 minutes when he managed to head home from a free-kick by brazilian diego .
freiburg 's papiss demba cisse levelled the score in the 36th minute after a series of miskicks and poor clearances saw the ball come to the senegalese international , allowing him to score from three meters .
cisse should have scored again six minutes after the break when daniel caligiuri broke clear and laid the ball to him , but cisse missed the open goal from 12 meters out .
grafite headed in from another diego free kick in the 64th minute .
" the foul happened on the touchline but the free kick was taken five metres inside the pitch , " freiburg coach robin dutt told reporters .
" the referee made a mistake but so we did by allowing grafite a free header . "
grafite meanwhile said he was happy to have secured his side the win .
" i am pleased that we picked up the three points .
we are doing well going forward and i think we have a strong team . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

their education or career training had been interrupted or unsuccessful , and they felt they needed to compensate for their shortcomings . according the report , a person 's identification with a particular extremist ideology depended more on coincidence and availability that true political conviction . often , the need to fit in led to violence or drug use .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 26.09.2010 merkel 's coalition approves minimal hike to welfare payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small increase in jobless benefits was approved the german government sunday agreed to beef up payments to the long-term unemployed by 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month .
the move comes despite the country 's tight financial situation and has been slammed by the unions . german labor minister ursula von der leyen told reporters sunday that members of the center-right coalition approved raising the benefits for long-term unemployed to 364 euros a month starting january 2011 .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million hartz iv recipients receive up to 359 euros per month . monthly benefits for children will remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively . the german public was not in favor of increases .
fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant . " " the idea that anybody who works should have more than those who do n't would turn into a joke , " the paper commented . author : gregg benzow , david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / epd / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2010 africa 's neocolonial era ending as us and france seek new partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and france want to strengthen the african union for generations , africa ’ s fate lay in the hands of self-interested foreign powers .
today , the us and france promise a fresh approach to the continent that puts africans in charge of their own security and development . during the post-world war ii period , the world 's major powers championed african independence in word , but undermined it in deed .
as the cold war broadened , the two superpowers manipulated the continent 's liberation movements for their own political ends . meanwhile , former imperial powers such as france pushed a hidden agenda that turned newly independent colonies into de-facto protectorates .
although african independence existed on paper , in reality the continent 's fate was still decided in foreign capitals .
the consequences of this neocolonialism are far reaching .
in a continent politically engineered by foreigners , national borders often are not worth the map they are drawn on .
many african states , designed in the mind of a european , can not maintain legitimacy before competing indigenous interests .
some have become failed states in which government authority often does not reach beyond the capital city .
this instability has bred transnational crime and terrorism that jeopardize global security .
the us and france have responded by initiating a strategy that seeks to stabilize the continent by strengthening african institutions instead of undermining them .
in the 21st century , african unity - not division - serves the interests of world powers .
drift into chaos as the soviet union careened toward collapse , the governing principle of us policy in africa became obsolete .
washington no longer needed to cultivate african allies to contain moscow 's influence on the continent .
as a result , the us began to refocus its involvement on humanitarian assistance . but a policy driven by humanitarianism proved unsustainable after the botched somalia intervention in 1993 , in which 18 us soldiers died .
washington pulled back and remained aloof from african affairs even as genocide gripped rwanda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us reduced its presence in africa after the intervention in somalia failed " after the cold war you could say africa was basically very low and this was strongly reflected by the management by the clinton administration , " roland marchal , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for international studies and research at sciencespo paris , told deutsche welle .
" for the european union the situation was never like that because of the colonial past . "
while us policy drifted , france maintained a neo-colonial relationship - called " francafrique " - with francophone africa .
paris had cultivated a quid-pro-quo agreement with its former colonies , supporting questionable regimes with its military in exchange for access to economic resources .
as the us and france tended to their own interests , many african states slid into disarray .
the world hardly lifted a finger as countries like sierra leone , liberia , somalia and the congo imploded in violence . partnership with africa the us received a shot across its bow in 1998 when al qaeda bombed its embassies in kenya and tanzania .
the link between state collapse in africa and international security became clear .
and september 11 underscored the global reach of transnational terrorist organizations that take refuge in failed states .
" if you look at us policy globally at all levels , i would say that africa still has the bottom priority of all the major regions around the world , " ambassador david shinn , former us ambassador to ethiopia and burkina faso , told deutsche welle .
" africa has increased somewhat in importance , first because increasing amounts of us oil are imported from africa , and second the counterterrorism angle .
that has clearly elevated africa in us interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has begun to broaden its policy in africa beyond colonial ties as result , the us quietly reengaged the continent .
it began training militaries in west and east africa to combat local terrorist organizations that claim ties to al qaeda .
in 2007 , washington established a separate military command for the continent called africom .
the command is designed to emphasize development aid and public diplomacy in addition to military cooperation . " there was a lot of suspicion about africom when it first rolled out , " richard downie , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" there were worries because of the colonial experience , that we 'll have troops on the ground and sort of a neo-colonial experience again .
i think it took a lot of persuasion to convince the african players that africom is not threatening , -lsb- that -rsb- it 's something that could be beneficial . "
while us strategy was finding direction , many french policymakers had already recognized that a policy based on old colonial ties made little sense in a world full of emerging economies .
paris broadened its engagement beyond the francophone countries and adopted a multilateral approach that included anglophone africa as well as its european partners . " there is currently a diversification of interests , " tobias koepf , a doctoral fellow with the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" france is less focused on historical ties and more on economic interests . "
as france modernizes its economic engagement in africa , it is also taking a greater interest in the continent 's long-term stability .
according to koepf , paris has begun to close ranks with washington in its approach to terrorism , particularly against organizations such as al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- and al-shabab in southern somalia . french nationals have been targeted frequently by aqim in recent months , provoking paris to declare war on the group . france and the us are now working through multilateral institutions such as the african union -lrb- au -rrb- instead of unilaterally pursuing their interests through lopsided bilateral ties that have unintended consequences .
they are helping the au establish a 10,000-strong standby force , which will give africa the ability to resolve crises on its own initiative .
new pitfalls although the us and france are modernizing their africa policies , the growing emphasis on cooperation with african militaries could lead to new pitfalls .
" the problem is when you want to implement this policy you understand that on the civilian component you do n't have the money , while on the military component you have the money , " marchal said .
" the balance between civil and military activities wo n't be taken very seriously . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy in africa remains fragile a lopsided focus on security could jeopardize the civil institutions that the us and france claim to support .
african leaders could use security - combating terrorism for example - as an excuse to clamp down on civil liberties and broaden executive power at the expense of fragile democracy .
that would signal a return to the irresponsible , exploitative policies of the past .
" with all the talk of building up institutions and building democracy , the democratic picture in africa is not as positive as it was at beginning of the millennium , " downie said .
" security priorities tend to override democratic priorities .
you 're seeing some negative trends at the moment in countries like ethiopia , where the elections were pretty disastrous .
-lsb- we 'll see -rsb- whether the us and france will put their money where their mouth is in terms of democracy instead of paying lip service . "

despite a rocky start , the benefits have outweighed the difficulties along the way , she said in a magazine interview . chancellor angela merkel said germany was beginning to reap the benefits of reunification , despite a difficult start for citizens of the former east germany . " for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process .

the move comes despite the country 's tight financial situation and has been slammed by the unions . german labor minister ursula von der leyen told reporters sunday that members of the center-right coalition approved raising the benefits for long-term unemployed to 364 euros a month starting january 2011 .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million hartz iv recipients receive up to 359 euros per month . monthly benefits for children will remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively . the german public was not in favor of increases .
fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant . " " the idea that anybody who works should have more than those who do n't would turn into a joke , " the paper commented . author : gregg benzow , david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / epd / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after abdellaoue 's goal , hanover allowed kaiserslautern to dominate .

with 13 points after six games , hanover have completed their best-ever start to the season .
hanover goalkeeper florian fromlowitz , formerly of kaiserslautern , said he experienced " mixed emotions " over his team 's victory .
" kaiserslautern is very close to my heart , but i said before the match that we needed to win , " fromlowitz said .

freiburg 's papiss demba cisse levelled the score in the 36th minute after a series of miskicks and poor clearances saw the ball come to the senegalese international , allowing him to score from three meters .
cisse should have scored again six minutes after the break when daniel caligiuri broke clear and laid the ball to him , but cisse missed the open goal from 12 meters out .
grafite headed in from another diego free kick in the 64th minute .
" the foul happened on the touchline but the free kick was taken five metres inside the pitch , " freiburg coach robin dutt told reporters .
" the referee made a mistake but so we did by allowing grafite a free header . "
grafite meanwhile said he was happy to have secured his side the win .
" i am pleased that we picked up the three points .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant . " " the idea that anybody who works should have more than those who do n't would turn into a joke , " the paper commented . author : gregg benzow , david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / epd / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wolfsburg 's grafite opened the scoring for the home side after 25 minutes when he managed to head home from a free-kick by brazilian diego .
freiburg 's papiss demba cisse levelled the score in the 36th minute after a series of miskicks and poor clearances saw the ball come to the senegalese international , allowing him to score from three meters .
cisse should have scored again six minutes after the break when daniel caligiuri broke clear and laid the ball to him , but cisse missed the open goal from 12 meters out .
grafite headed in from another diego free kick in the 64th minute .
" the foul happened on the touchline but the free kick was taken five metres inside the pitch , " freiburg coach robin dutt told reporters .
" the referee made a mistake but so we did by allowing grafite a free header . "
grafite meanwhile said he was happy to have secured his side the win .
" i am pleased that we picked up the three points .
we are doing well going forward and i think we have a strong team . "

both the report found that political conviction took a backseat to social motivations in the process of radicalization . desire to fit in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many extremists come from dysfunctional families young people are attracted to the feeling of belonging that a group gives them , rather than to the political viewpoints of the group , according to thomas kliche , a political psychology researcher at the university of hamburg . " the ideology is a very second rate ideology in their biography , " he said .
" at that age they do n't even comprehend the reach of these ideas , they just comprehend , ' the group tells me i 'm fine , the group tells me i 'm strong . " ' but not all young people are equally susceptible to the allure of group identity .
nearly all the extremists interviewed came from dysfunctional families . poor family relations can heighten appeal of the group , kliche said . " most offenders do come from broken homes ... or their family is not able to provide them a feeling of security , of warmth , of being welcome , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is where the group steps in . " something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people who radicalize often end up in jail the report also found that many of those interviewed , in addition to having emotionally or structurally disturbed families , had failed to fit in with society in other ways .
their education or career training had been interrupted or unsuccessful , and they felt they needed to compensate for their shortcomings . according the report , a person 's identification with a particular extremist ideology depended more on coincidence and availability that true political conviction . often , the need to fit in led to violence or drug use .
most of the participants had been involved in delinquent behavior before joining a radical scene , leading the author of the report to conclude that so-called " politically motivated crime " often had no real ideological motivation . author : sarah harman editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a rocky start , the benefits have outweighed the difficulties along the way , she said in a magazine interview . chancellor angela merkel said germany was beginning to reap the benefits of reunification , despite a difficult start for citizens of the former east germany . " for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process . " during the difficult 1990s it sometimes did n't feel right to talk of flowering landscapes , " said merkel , adding that she believed the description was now a reality in many parts of the former east germany . but some gaps between germany 's eastern and western states remain .
pay in the east is lower while unemployment is higher .
as a result , many young people in the east have moved west in search for jobs . the chancellor pointed out that the majority of people had voted in east german elections for parties in favor of joining a united germany under the existing constitution of the west . merkel was deputy spokeswoman of the eastern pre-unification caretaker government under lothar de maiziere . " the situation was completely clear , " she told the magazine .
" the people had no desire to wait , or to pursue some kind of third way .
they wanted german unity .
that was then our political task and we fulfilled it . " merkel said in the interview that the she believed that the solidarity pact , under which the eastern states still receive aid for development from those in the west , would not need to continue beyond its planned phasing-out in 2019 . the chancellor said she believed that the prosperity levels in the eastern states would approach those in the west by that time . " naturally , after that , a financial adjustment will also exist between the states , " merkel said referring to the normal way in which germany 's states , including those in the west , subsidize each other . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

despite a rocky start , the benefits have outweighed the difficulties along the way , she said in a magazine interview . chancellor angela merkel said germany was beginning to reap the benefits of reunification , despite a difficult start for citizens of the former east germany . " for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process . " during the difficult 1990s it sometimes did n't feel right to talk of flowering landscapes , " said merkel , adding that she believed the description was now a reality in many parts of the former east germany . but some gaps between germany 's eastern and western states remain .
pay in the east is lower while unemployment is higher .
as a result , many young people in the east have moved west in search for jobs . the chancellor pointed out that the majority of people had voted in east german elections for parties in favor of joining a united germany under the existing constitution of the west . merkel was deputy spokeswoman of the eastern pre-unification caretaker government under lothar de maiziere . " the situation was completely clear , " she told the magazine .
" the people had no desire to wait , or to pursue some kind of third way .
they wanted german unity .
that was then our political task and we fulfilled it . " merkel said in the interview that the she believed that the solidarity pact , under which the eastern states still receive aid for development from those in the west , would not need to continue beyond its planned phasing-out in 2019 . the chancellor said she believed that the prosperity levels in the eastern states would approach those in the west by that time . " naturally , after that , a financial adjustment will also exist between the states , " merkel said referring to the normal way in which germany 's states , including those in the west , subsidize each other . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .

" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .

the home team should have equalized on several occasions , but instead leon jessen only hit the post and brazilian defender rodnei squandered a good chance , shooting wide late in the game .
with 13 points after six games , hanover have completed their best-ever start to the season .
hanover goalkeeper florian fromlowitz , formerly of kaiserslautern , said he experienced " mixed emotions " over his team 's victory .
" kaiserslautern is very close to my heart , but i said before the match that we needed to win , " fromlowitz said .
" i am glad that we managed to do that , but after the game i went to kaiserslautern 's goalkeeper coach gerry ehrmann and their goalkeeper tobias sippel and thanked them as they were great to work with when i was still with the club . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grafite celebrates after heading in against freiburg wolfsburg jump up the table wolfsburg scored their third win in a row 2-1 against freiburg as they continued to recover after losing their first three games of the season .
despite a rocky start to the season , the 2009 bundesliga champions are now in sixth place with nine points from six matches .
wolfsburg 's grafite opened the scoring for the home side after 25 minutes when he managed to head home from a free-kick by brazilian diego .
freiburg 's papiss demba cisse levelled the score in the 36th minute after a series of miskicks and poor clearances saw the ball come to the senegalese international , allowing him to score from three meters .
cisse should have scored again six minutes after the break when daniel caligiuri broke clear and laid the ball to him , but cisse missed the open goal from 12 meters out .
grafite headed in from another diego free kick in the 64th minute .
" the foul happened on the touchline but the free kick was taken five metres inside the pitch , " freiburg coach robin dutt told reporters .
" the referee made a mistake but so we did by allowing grafite a free header . "
grafite meanwhile said he was happy to have secured his side the win .
" i am pleased that we picked up the three points .
we are doing well going forward and i think we have a strong team . "

today , the us and france promise a fresh approach to the continent that puts africans in charge of their own security and development . during the post-world war ii period , the world 's major powers championed african independence in word , but undermined it in deed .
as the cold war broadened , the two superpowers manipulated the continent 's liberation movements for their own political ends . meanwhile , former imperial powers such as france pushed a hidden agenda that turned newly independent colonies into de-facto protectorates .
although african independence existed on paper , in reality the continent 's fate was still decided in foreign capitals .
the consequences of this neocolonialism are far reaching .
in a continent politically engineered by foreigners , national borders often are not worth the map they are drawn on .
many african states , designed in the mind of a european , can not maintain legitimacy before competing indigenous interests .
some have become failed states in which government authority often does not reach beyond the capital city .
this instability has bred transnational crime and terrorism that jeopardize global security .
the us and france have responded by initiating a strategy that seeks to stabilize the continent by strengthening african institutions instead of undermining them .
in the 21st century , african unity - not division - serves the interests of world powers .
drift into chaos as the soviet union careened toward collapse , the governing principle of us policy in africa became obsolete .
washington no longer needed to cultivate african allies to contain moscow 's influence on the continent .
as a result , the us began to refocus its involvement on humanitarian assistance . but a policy driven by humanitarianism proved unsustainable after the botched somalia intervention in 1993 , in which 18 us soldiers died .
washington pulled back and remained aloof from african affairs even as genocide gripped rwanda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us reduced its presence in africa after the intervention in somalia failed " after the cold war you could say africa was basically very low and this was strongly reflected by the management by the clinton administration , " roland marchal , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for international studies and research at sciencespo paris , told deutsche welle .
" for the european union the situation was never like that because of the colonial past . "
while us policy drifted , france maintained a neo-colonial relationship - called " francafrique " - with francophone africa .
paris had cultivated a quid-pro-quo agreement with its former colonies , supporting questionable regimes with its military in exchange for access to economic resources .
as the us and france tended to their own interests , many african states slid into disarray .
the world hardly lifted a finger as countries like sierra leone , liberia , somalia and the congo imploded in violence . partnership with africa the us received a shot across its bow in 1998 when al qaeda bombed its embassies in kenya and tanzania .
the link between state collapse in africa and international security became clear .
and september 11 underscored the global reach of transnational terrorist organizations that take refuge in failed states .
" if you look at us policy globally at all levels , i would say that africa still has the bottom priority of all the major regions around the world , " ambassador david shinn , former us ambassador to ethiopia and burkina faso , told deutsche welle .
" africa has increased somewhat in importance , first because increasing amounts of us oil are imported from africa , and second the counterterrorism angle .
that has clearly elevated africa in us interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has begun to broaden its policy in africa beyond colonial ties as result , the us quietly reengaged the continent .
it began training militaries in west and east africa to combat local terrorist organizations that claim ties to al qaeda .
in 2007 , washington established a separate military command for the continent called africom .
the command is designed to emphasize development aid and public diplomacy in addition to military cooperation . " there was a lot of suspicion about africom when it first rolled out , " richard downie , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" there were worries because of the colonial experience , that we 'll have troops on the ground and sort of a neo-colonial experience again .
i think it took a lot of persuasion to convince the african players that africom is not threatening , -lsb- that -rsb- it 's something that could be beneficial . "
while us strategy was finding direction , many french policymakers had already recognized that a policy based on old colonial ties made little sense in a world full of emerging economies .
paris broadened its engagement beyond the francophone countries and adopted a multilateral approach that included anglophone africa as well as its european partners . " there is currently a diversification of interests , " tobias koepf , a doctoral fellow with the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" france is less focused on historical ties and more on economic interests . "
as france modernizes its economic engagement in africa , it is also taking a greater interest in the continent 's long-term stability .
according to koepf , paris has begun to close ranks with washington in its approach to terrorism , particularly against organizations such as al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- and al-shabab in southern somalia . french nationals have been targeted frequently by aqim in recent months , provoking paris to declare war on the group . france and the us are now working through multilateral institutions such as the african union -lrb- au -rrb- instead of unilaterally pursuing their interests through lopsided bilateral ties that have unintended consequences .
they are helping the au establish a 10,000-strong standby force , which will give africa the ability to resolve crises on its own initiative .
new pitfalls although the us and france are modernizing their africa policies , the growing emphasis on cooperation with african militaries could lead to new pitfalls .
" the problem is when you want to implement this policy you understand that on the civilian component you do n't have the money , while on the military component you have the money , " marchal said .
" the balance between civil and military activities wo n't be taken very seriously . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy in africa remains fragile a lopsided focus on security could jeopardize the civil institutions that the us and france claim to support .
african leaders could use security - combating terrorism for example - as an excuse to clamp down on civil liberties and broaden executive power at the expense of fragile democracy .
that would signal a return to the irresponsible , exploitative policies of the past .
" with all the talk of building up institutions and building democracy , the democratic picture in africa is not as positive as it was at beginning of the millennium , " downie said .
" security priorities tend to override democratic priorities .
you 're seeing some negative trends at the moment in countries like ethiopia , where the elections were pretty disastrous .
-lsb- we 'll see -rsb- whether the us and france will put their money where their mouth is in terms of democracy instead of paying lip service . "

despite a rocky start , the benefits have outweighed the difficulties along the way , she said in a magazine interview . chancellor angela merkel said germany was beginning to reap the benefits of reunification , despite a difficult start for citizens of the former east germany . " for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process . " during the difficult 1990s it sometimes did n't feel right to talk of flowering landscapes , " said merkel , adding that she believed the description was now a reality in many parts of the former east germany . but some gaps between germany 's eastern and western states remain .
pay in the east is lower while unemployment is higher .
as a result , many young people in the east have moved west in search for jobs . the chancellor pointed out that the majority of people had voted in east german elections for parties in favor of joining a united germany under the existing constitution of the west . merkel was deputy spokeswoman of the eastern pre-unification caretaker government under lothar de maiziere . " the situation was completely clear , " she told the magazine .
" the people had no desire to wait , or to pursue some kind of third way .
they wanted german unity .
that was then our political task and we fulfilled it . " merkel said in the interview that the she believed that the solidarity pact , under which the eastern states still receive aid for development from those in the west , would not need to continue beyond its planned phasing-out in 2019 . the chancellor said she believed that the prosperity levels in the eastern states would approach those in the west by that time . " naturally , after that , a financial adjustment will also exist between the states , " merkel said referring to the normal way in which germany 's states , including those in the west , subsidize each other . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process . " during the difficult 1990s it sometimes did n't feel right to talk of flowering landscapes , " said merkel , adding that she believed the description was now a reality in many parts of the former east germany . but some gaps between germany 's eastern and western states remain .
pay in the east is lower while unemployment is higher .
as a result , many young people in the east have moved west in search for jobs . the chancellor pointed out that the majority of people had voted in east german elections for parties in favor of joining a united germany under the existing constitution of the west . merkel was deputy spokeswoman of the eastern pre-unification caretaker government under lothar de maiziere . " the situation was completely clear , " she told the magazine .
" the people had no desire to wait , or to pursue some kind of third way .
they wanted german unity .
that was then our political task and we fulfilled it . " merkel said in the interview that the she believed that the solidarity pact , under which the eastern states still receive aid for development from those in the west , would not need to continue beyond its planned phasing-out in 2019 . the chancellor said she believed that the prosperity levels in the eastern states would approach those in the west by that time . " naturally , after that , a financial adjustment will also exist between the states , " merkel said referring to the normal way in which germany 's states , including those in the west , subsidize each other . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 26.09.2010 merkel 's coalition approves minimal hike to welfare payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small increase in jobless benefits was approved the german government sunday agreed to beef up payments to the long-term unemployed by 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month .
the move comes despite the country 's tight financial situation and has been slammed by the unions . german labor minister ursula von der leyen told reporters sunday that members of the center-right coalition approved raising the benefits for long-term unemployed to 364 euros a month starting january 2011 .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million hartz iv recipients receive up to 359 euros per month . monthly benefits for children will remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively . the german public was not in favor of increases .
fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant . " " the idea that anybody who works should have more than those who do n't would turn into a joke , " the paper commented . author : gregg benzow , david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / epd / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a rocky start , the benefits have outweighed the difficulties along the way , she said in a magazine interview . chancellor angela merkel said germany was beginning to reap the benefits of reunification , despite a difficult start for citizens of the former east germany . " for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process . " during the difficult 1990s it sometimes did n't feel right to talk of flowering landscapes , " said merkel , adding that she believed the description was now a reality in many parts of the former east germany . but some gaps between germany 's eastern and western states remain .
pay in the east is lower while unemployment is higher .
as a result , many young people in the east have moved west in search for jobs . the chancellor pointed out that the majority of people had voted in east german elections for parties in favor of joining a united germany under the existing constitution of the west . merkel was deputy spokeswoman of the eastern pre-unification caretaker government under lothar de maiziere . " the situation was completely clear , " she told the magazine .
" the people had no desire to wait , or to pursue some kind of third way .
they wanted german unity .
that was then our political task and we fulfilled it . " merkel said in the interview that the she believed that the solidarity pact , under which the eastern states still receive aid for development from those in the west , would not need to continue beyond its planned phasing-out in 2019 . the chancellor said she believed that the prosperity levels in the eastern states would approach those in the west by that time . " naturally , after that , a financial adjustment will also exist between the states , " merkel said referring to the normal way in which germany 's states , including those in the west , subsidize each other . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wolfsburg meanwhile continue their comback , toppling freiburg . hanover and wolfsburg both climbed in the bundesliga soccer table sunday after beating kaiserslautern and freiburg respectively .
in kaiserslautern , hanover 's norwegian international mohammed abdellaoue scored the only goal of the match 33 minutes into the game , putting his team in third place .
after abdellaoue 's goal , hanover allowed kaiserslautern to dominate .
the home team should have equalized on several occasions , but instead leon jessen only hit the post and brazilian defender rodnei squandered a good chance , shooting wide late in the game .
with 13 points after six games , hanover have completed their best-ever start to the season .
hanover goalkeeper florian fromlowitz , formerly of kaiserslautern , said he experienced " mixed emotions " over his team 's victory .
" kaiserslautern is very close to my heart , but i said before the match that we needed to win , " fromlowitz said .
" i am glad that we managed to do that , but after the game i went to kaiserslautern 's goalkeeper coach gerry ehrmann and their goalkeeper tobias sippel and thanked them as they were great to work with when i was still with the club . "

despite a rocky start to the season , the 2009 bundesliga champions are now in sixth place with nine points from six matches .
wolfsburg 's grafite opened the scoring for the home side after 25 minutes when he managed to head home from a free-kick by brazilian diego .
freiburg 's papiss demba cisse levelled the score in the 36th minute after a series of miskicks and poor clearances saw the ball come to the senegalese international , allowing him to score from three meters .
cisse should have scored again six minutes after the break when daniel caligiuri broke clear and laid the ball to him , but cisse missed the open goal from 12 meters out .
grafite headed in from another diego free kick in the 64th minute .
" the foul happened on the touchline but the free kick was taken five metres inside the pitch , " freiburg coach robin dutt told reporters .
" the referee made a mistake but so we did by allowing grafite a free header . "
grafite meanwhile said he was happy to have secured his side the win .
" i am pleased that we picked up the three points .
we are doing well going forward and i think we have a strong team . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

the move comes despite the country 's tight financial situation and has been slammed by the unions . german labor minister ursula von der leyen told reporters sunday that members of the center-right coalition approved raising the benefits for long-term unemployed to 364 euros a month starting january 2011 .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million hartz iv recipients receive up to 359 euros per month . monthly benefits for children will remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively . the german public was not in favor of increases .
fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 26.09.2010 merkel 's coalition approves minimal hike to welfare payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small increase in jobless benefits was approved the german government sunday agreed to beef up payments to the long-term unemployed by 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month .
the move comes despite the country 's tight financial situation and has been slammed by the unions . german labor minister ursula von der leyen told reporters sunday that members of the center-right coalition approved raising the benefits for long-term unemployed to 364 euros a month starting january 2011 .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million hartz iv recipients receive up to 359 euros per month . monthly benefits for children will remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively . the german public was not in favor of increases .
fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant . " " the idea that anybody who works should have more than those who do n't would turn into a joke , " the paper commented . author : gregg benzow , david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / epd / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.09.2010 africa 's neocolonial era ending as us and france seek new partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and france want to strengthen the african union for generations , africa ’ s fate lay in the hands of self-interested foreign powers .
today , the us and france promise a fresh approach to the continent that puts africans in charge of their own security and development . during the post-world war ii period , the world 's major powers championed african independence in word , but undermined it in deed .
as the cold war broadened , the two superpowers manipulated the continent 's liberation movements for their own political ends . meanwhile , former imperial powers such as france pushed a hidden agenda that turned newly independent colonies into de-facto protectorates .
although african independence existed on paper , in reality the continent 's fate was still decided in foreign capitals .
the consequences of this neocolonialism are far reaching .
in a continent politically engineered by foreigners , national borders often are not worth the map they are drawn on .
many african states , designed in the mind of a european , can not maintain legitimacy before competing indigenous interests .
some have become failed states in which government authority often does not reach beyond the capital city .
this instability has bred transnational crime and terrorism that jeopardize global security .
the us and france have responded by initiating a strategy that seeks to stabilize the continent by strengthening african institutions instead of undermining them .
in the 21st century , african unity - not division - serves the interests of world powers .
drift into chaos as the soviet union careened toward collapse , the governing principle of us policy in africa became obsolete .
washington no longer needed to cultivate african allies to contain moscow 's influence on the continent .
as a result , the us began to refocus its involvement on humanitarian assistance . but a policy driven by humanitarianism proved unsustainable after the botched somalia intervention in 1993 , in which 18 us soldiers died .
washington pulled back and remained aloof from african affairs even as genocide gripped rwanda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us reduced its presence in africa after the intervention in somalia failed " after the cold war you could say africa was basically very low and this was strongly reflected by the management by the clinton administration , " roland marchal , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for international studies and research at sciencespo paris , told deutsche welle .
" for the european union the situation was never like that because of the colonial past . "
while us policy drifted , france maintained a neo-colonial relationship - called " francafrique " - with francophone africa .
paris had cultivated a quid-pro-quo agreement with its former colonies , supporting questionable regimes with its military in exchange for access to economic resources .
as the us and france tended to their own interests , many african states slid into disarray .
the world hardly lifted a finger as countries like sierra leone , liberia , somalia and the congo imploded in violence . partnership with africa the us received a shot across its bow in 1998 when al qaeda bombed its embassies in kenya and tanzania .
the link between state collapse in africa and international security became clear .
and september 11 underscored the global reach of transnational terrorist organizations that take refuge in failed states .
" if you look at us policy globally at all levels , i would say that africa still has the bottom priority of all the major regions around the world , " ambassador david shinn , former us ambassador to ethiopia and burkina faso , told deutsche welle .
" africa has increased somewhat in importance , first because increasing amounts of us oil are imported from africa , and second the counterterrorism angle .
that has clearly elevated africa in us interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has begun to broaden its policy in africa beyond colonial ties as result , the us quietly reengaged the continent .
it began training militaries in west and east africa to combat local terrorist organizations that claim ties to al qaeda .
in 2007 , washington established a separate military command for the continent called africom .
the command is designed to emphasize development aid and public diplomacy in addition to military cooperation . " there was a lot of suspicion about africom when it first rolled out , " richard downie , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" there were worries because of the colonial experience , that we 'll have troops on the ground and sort of a neo-colonial experience again .
i think it took a lot of persuasion to convince the african players that africom is not threatening , -lsb- that -rsb- it 's something that could be beneficial . "
while us strategy was finding direction , many french policymakers had already recognized that a policy based on old colonial ties made little sense in a world full of emerging economies .
paris broadened its engagement beyond the francophone countries and adopted a multilateral approach that included anglophone africa as well as its european partners . " there is currently a diversification of interests , " tobias koepf , a doctoral fellow with the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" france is less focused on historical ties and more on economic interests . "
as france modernizes its economic engagement in africa , it is also taking a greater interest in the continent 's long-term stability .
according to koepf , paris has begun to close ranks with washington in its approach to terrorism , particularly against organizations such as al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- and al-shabab in southern somalia . french nationals have been targeted frequently by aqim in recent months , provoking paris to declare war on the group . france and the us are now working through multilateral institutions such as the african union -lrb- au -rrb- instead of unilaterally pursuing their interests through lopsided bilateral ties that have unintended consequences .
they are helping the au establish a 10,000-strong standby force , which will give africa the ability to resolve crises on its own initiative .
new pitfalls although the us and france are modernizing their africa policies , the growing emphasis on cooperation with african militaries could lead to new pitfalls .
" the problem is when you want to implement this policy you understand that on the civilian component you do n't have the money , while on the military component you have the money , " marchal said .
" the balance between civil and military activities wo n't be taken very seriously . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy in africa remains fragile a lopsided focus on security could jeopardize the civil institutions that the us and france claim to support .
african leaders could use security - combating terrorism for example - as an excuse to clamp down on civil liberties and broaden executive power at the expense of fragile democracy .
that would signal a return to the irresponsible , exploitative policies of the past .
" with all the talk of building up institutions and building democracy , the democratic picture in africa is not as positive as it was at beginning of the millennium , " downie said .
" security priorities tend to override democratic priorities .
you 're seeing some negative trends at the moment in countries like ethiopia , where the elections were pretty disastrous .
-lsb- we 'll see -rsb- whether the us and france will put their money where their mouth is in terms of democracy instead of paying lip service . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

the move comes despite the country 's tight financial situation and has been slammed by the unions . german labor minister ursula von der leyen told reporters sunday that members of the center-right coalition approved raising the benefits for long-term unemployed to 364 euros a month starting january 2011 .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million hartz iv recipients receive up to 359 euros per month . monthly benefits for children will remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively . the german public was not in favor of increases .
fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant . " " the idea that anybody who works should have more than those who do n't would turn into a joke , " the paper commented . author : gregg benzow , david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / epd / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant . " " the idea that anybody who works should have more than those who do n't would turn into a joke , " the paper commented . author : gregg benzow , david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / epd / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

heavy rain and fog , however , killed off his chances for a world record . kenyan patrick makau won the 37th berlin marathon , but failed to break the world record set on the course two years ago by ethiopian haile gebrselassie . makau finished more than a minute outside the record in a time of two hours , five minutes and eight seconds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's berlin marathon attracted over 40,000 entrants compatriot geoffrey mutai tucked in behind him , crossing the line just two seconds later .

today , the us and france promise a fresh approach to the continent that puts africans in charge of their own security and development . during the post-world war ii period , the world 's major powers championed african independence in word , but undermined it in deed .
as the cold war broadened , the two superpowers manipulated the continent 's liberation movements for their own political ends . meanwhile , former imperial powers such as france pushed a hidden agenda that turned newly independent colonies into de-facto protectorates .
although african independence existed on paper , in reality the continent 's fate was still decided in foreign capitals .
the consequences of this neocolonialism are far reaching .
in a continent politically engineered by foreigners , national borders often are not worth the map they are drawn on .
many african states , designed in the mind of a european , can not maintain legitimacy before competing indigenous interests .
some have become failed states in which government authority often does not reach beyond the capital city .
this instability has bred transnational crime and terrorism that jeopardize global security .
the us and france have responded by initiating a strategy that seeks to stabilize the continent by strengthening african institutions instead of undermining them .
in the 21st century , african unity - not division - serves the interests of world powers .
drift into chaos as the soviet union careened toward collapse , the governing principle of us policy in africa became obsolete .
washington no longer needed to cultivate african allies to contain moscow 's influence on the continent .
as a result , the us began to refocus its involvement on humanitarian assistance . but a policy driven by humanitarianism proved unsustainable after the botched somalia intervention in 1993 , in which 18 us soldiers died .
washington pulled back and remained aloof from african affairs even as genocide gripped rwanda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us reduced its presence in africa after the intervention in somalia failed " after the cold war you could say africa was basically very low and this was strongly reflected by the management by the clinton administration , " roland marchal , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for international studies and research at sciencespo paris , told deutsche welle .
" for the european union the situation was never like that because of the colonial past . "
while us policy drifted , france maintained a neo-colonial relationship - called " francafrique " - with francophone africa .
paris had cultivated a quid-pro-quo agreement with its former colonies , supporting questionable regimes with its military in exchange for access to economic resources .
as the us and france tended to their own interests , many african states slid into disarray .
the world hardly lifted a finger as countries like sierra leone , liberia , somalia and the congo imploded in violence . partnership with africa the us received a shot across its bow in 1998 when al qaeda bombed its embassies in kenya and tanzania .
the link between state collapse in africa and international security became clear .
and september 11 underscored the global reach of transnational terrorist organizations that take refuge in failed states .
" if you look at us policy globally at all levels , i would say that africa still has the bottom priority of all the major regions around the world , " ambassador david shinn , former us ambassador to ethiopia and burkina faso , told deutsche welle .
" africa has increased somewhat in importance , first because increasing amounts of us oil are imported from africa , and second the counterterrorism angle .
that has clearly elevated africa in us interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has begun to broaden its policy in africa beyond colonial ties as result , the us quietly reengaged the continent .
it began training militaries in west and east africa to combat local terrorist organizations that claim ties to al qaeda .
in 2007 , washington established a separate military command for the continent called africom .
the command is designed to emphasize development aid and public diplomacy in addition to military cooperation . " there was a lot of suspicion about africom when it first rolled out , " richard downie , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" there were worries because of the colonial experience , that we 'll have troops on the ground and sort of a neo-colonial experience again .
i think it took a lot of persuasion to convince the african players that africom is not threatening , -lsb- that -rsb- it 's something that could be beneficial . "
while us strategy was finding direction , many french policymakers had already recognized that a policy based on old colonial ties made little sense in a world full of emerging economies .
paris broadened its engagement beyond the francophone countries and adopted a multilateral approach that included anglophone africa as well as its european partners . " there is currently a diversification of interests , " tobias koepf , a doctoral fellow with the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" france is less focused on historical ties and more on economic interests . "
as france modernizes its economic engagement in africa , it is also taking a greater interest in the continent 's long-term stability .
according to koepf , paris has begun to close ranks with washington in its approach to terrorism , particularly against organizations such as al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- and al-shabab in southern somalia . french nationals have been targeted frequently by aqim in recent months , provoking paris to declare war on the group . france and the us are now working through multilateral institutions such as the african union -lrb- au -rrb- instead of unilaterally pursuing their interests through lopsided bilateral ties that have unintended consequences .
they are helping the au establish a 10,000-strong standby force , which will give africa the ability to resolve crises on its own initiative .
new pitfalls although the us and france are modernizing their africa policies , the growing emphasis on cooperation with african militaries could lead to new pitfalls .
" the problem is when you want to implement this policy you understand that on the civilian component you do n't have the money , while on the military component you have the money , " marchal said .
" the balance between civil and military activities wo n't be taken very seriously . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy in africa remains fragile a lopsided focus on security could jeopardize the civil institutions that the us and france claim to support .
african leaders could use security - combating terrorism for example - as an excuse to clamp down on civil liberties and broaden executive power at the expense of fragile democracy .
that would signal a return to the irresponsible , exploitative policies of the past .
" with all the talk of building up institutions and building democracy , the democratic picture in africa is not as positive as it was at beginning of the millennium , " downie said .
" security priorities tend to override democratic priorities .
you 're seeing some negative trends at the moment in countries like ethiopia , where the elections were pretty disastrous .
-lsb- we 'll see -rsb- whether the us and france will put their money where their mouth is in terms of democracy instead of paying lip service . "

although african independence existed on paper , in reality the continent 's fate was still decided in foreign capitals .
the consequences of this neocolonialism are far reaching .
in a continent politically engineered by foreigners , national borders often are not worth the map they are drawn on .
many african states , designed in the mind of a european , can not maintain legitimacy before competing indigenous interests .
some have become failed states in which government authority often does not reach beyond the capital city .
this instability has bred transnational crime and terrorism that jeopardize global security .
the us and france have responded by initiating a strategy that seeks to stabilize the continent by strengthening african institutions instead of undermining them .
in the 21st century , african unity - not division - serves the interests of world powers .
drift into chaos as the soviet union careened toward collapse , the governing principle of us policy in africa became obsolete .
washington no longer needed to cultivate african allies to contain moscow 's influence on the continent .
as a result , the us began to refocus its involvement on humanitarian assistance . but a policy driven by humanitarianism proved unsustainable after the botched somalia intervention in 1993 , in which 18 us soldiers died .
washington pulled back and remained aloof from african affairs even as genocide gripped rwanda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us reduced its presence in africa after the intervention in somalia failed " after the cold war you could say africa was basically very low and this was strongly reflected by the management by the clinton administration , " roland marchal , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for international studies and research at sciencespo paris , told deutsche welle .
" for the european union the situation was never like that because of the colonial past . "
while us policy drifted , france maintained a neo-colonial relationship - called " francafrique " - with francophone africa .
paris had cultivated a quid-pro-quo agreement with its former colonies , supporting questionable regimes with its military in exchange for access to economic resources .
as the us and france tended to their own interests , many african states slid into disarray .
the world hardly lifted a finger as countries like sierra leone , liberia , somalia and the congo imploded in violence . partnership with africa the us received a shot across its bow in 1998 when al qaeda bombed its embassies in kenya and tanzania .
the link between state collapse in africa and international security became clear .
and september 11 underscored the global reach of transnational terrorist organizations that take refuge in failed states .
" if you look at us policy globally at all levels , i would say that africa still has the bottom priority of all the major regions around the world , " ambassador david shinn , former us ambassador to ethiopia and burkina faso , told deutsche welle .
" africa has increased somewhat in importance , first because increasing amounts of us oil are imported from africa , and second the counterterrorism angle .
that has clearly elevated africa in us interests . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has begun to broaden its policy in africa beyond colonial ties as result , the us quietly reengaged the continent .
it began training militaries in west and east africa to combat local terrorist organizations that claim ties to al qaeda .
in 2007 , washington established a separate military command for the continent called africom .
the command is designed to emphasize development aid and public diplomacy in addition to military cooperation . " there was a lot of suspicion about africom when it first rolled out , " richard downie , an expert on sub-saharan africa with the center for strategic and international studies , told deutsche welle .
" there were worries because of the colonial experience , that we 'll have troops on the ground and sort of a neo-colonial experience again .
i think it took a lot of persuasion to convince the african players that africom is not threatening , -lsb- that -rsb- it 's something that could be beneficial . "
while us strategy was finding direction , many french policymakers had already recognized that a policy based on old colonial ties made little sense in a world full of emerging economies .
paris broadened its engagement beyond the francophone countries and adopted a multilateral approach that included anglophone africa as well as its european partners . " there is currently a diversification of interests , " tobias koepf , a doctoral fellow with the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" france is less focused on historical ties and more on economic interests . "
as france modernizes its economic engagement in africa , it is also taking a greater interest in the continent 's long-term stability .
according to koepf , paris has begun to close ranks with washington in its approach to terrorism , particularly against organizations such as al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- and al-shabab in southern somalia . french nationals have been targeted frequently by aqim in recent months , provoking paris to declare war on the group . france and the us are now working through multilateral institutions such as the african union -lrb- au -rrb- instead of unilaterally pursuing their interests through lopsided bilateral ties that have unintended consequences .
they are helping the au establish a 10,000-strong standby force , which will give africa the ability to resolve crises on its own initiative .
new pitfalls although the us and france are modernizing their africa policies , the growing emphasis on cooperation with african militaries could lead to new pitfalls .
" the problem is when you want to implement this policy you understand that on the civilian component you do n't have the money , while on the military component you have the money , " marchal said .
" the balance between civil and military activities wo n't be taken very seriously . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy in africa remains fragile a lopsided focus on security could jeopardize the civil institutions that the us and france claim to support .
african leaders could use security - combating terrorism for example - as an excuse to clamp down on civil liberties and broaden executive power at the expense of fragile democracy .
that would signal a return to the irresponsible , exploitative policies of the past .
" with all the talk of building up institutions and building democracy , the democratic picture in africa is not as positive as it was at beginning of the millennium , " downie said .
" security priorities tend to override democratic priorities .
you 're seeing some negative trends at the moment in countries like ethiopia , where the elections were pretty disastrous .
-lsb- we 'll see -rsb- whether the us and france will put their money where their mouth is in terms of democracy instead of paying lip service . "

the move comes despite the country 's tight financial situation and has been slammed by the unions . german labor minister ursula von der leyen told reporters sunday that members of the center-right coalition approved raising the benefits for long-term unemployed to 364 euros a month starting january 2011 .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million hartz iv recipients receive up to 359 euros per month . monthly benefits for children will remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively . the german public was not in favor of increases .
fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .
both merkel and fdp chief guido westerwelle said they were " very satisfied " with the agreement . csu party leader horst seehofer had earlier vowed to oppose any increase , saying , " the social welfare state must not lose control ; it has to remain affordable . " the fdp 's parliamentary leader , birgit homburger , meanwhile defended cuts for tobacco and alcohol and instead proposed access to modern communications .
" there are good arguments that nowadays internet access is a basic right , " she said . unions warn of poverty meanwhile , germany 's labor unions were quick to warn that any cuts in unemployment benefits would produce more poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions warn against driving people further into poverty annelie buntenbach , from the german federation of trade unions , accused the government of not protecting hartz iv recipients from drifting deeper into an economic hole . " the planned increase of 10 euros for the long-term unemployed is just not enough , " she said , before the cabinet approved the 5 euro hike .
" the increase is so low that a family could n't even afford to go to a public pool . " the bild am sonntag newspaper in an editorial pointed out that an increase of 11 euros would have amounted to a 3 percent increase .
instead the increase will be less than half that figure . the weekly paper called demands some members of the opposition had made for a 30-euro or 40-euro increase " exorbitant . " " the idea that anybody who works should have more than those who do n't would turn into a joke , " the paper commented . author : gregg benzow , david levitz -lrb- afp / dpa / epd / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

despite a rocky start , the benefits have outweighed the difficulties along the way , she said in a magazine interview . chancellor angela merkel said germany was beginning to reap the benefits of reunification , despite a difficult start for citizens of the former east germany . " for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process . " during the difficult 1990s it sometimes did n't feel right to talk of flowering landscapes , " said merkel , adding that she believed the description was now a reality in many parts of the former east germany . but some gaps between germany 's eastern and western states remain .
pay in the east is lower while unemployment is higher .
as a result , many young people in the east have moved west in search for jobs . the chancellor pointed out that the majority of people had voted in east german elections for parties in favor of joining a united germany under the existing constitution of the west . merkel was deputy spokeswoman of the eastern pre-unification caretaker government under lothar de maiziere . " the situation was completely clear , " she told the magazine .
" the people had no desire to wait , or to pursue some kind of third way .
they wanted german unity .
that was then our political task and we fulfilled it . " merkel said in the interview that the she believed that the solidarity pact , under which the eastern states still receive aid for development from those in the west , would not need to continue beyond its planned phasing-out in 2019 . the chancellor said she believed that the prosperity levels in the eastern states would approach those in the west by that time . " naturally , after that , a financial adjustment will also exist between the states , " merkel said referring to the normal way in which germany 's states , including those in the west , subsidize each other . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

the move comes despite the country 's tight financial situation and has been slammed by the unions . german labor minister ursula von der leyen told reporters sunday that members of the center-right coalition approved raising the benefits for long-term unemployed to 364 euros a month starting january 2011 .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million hartz iv recipients receive up to 359 euros per month . monthly benefits for children will remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively . the german public was not in favor of increases .
fifty-six percent of those questioned in a survey by the emnid polling institute for the german newspaper bild am sonntag , said they opposed any increase in welfare payments , no matter how small . the move comes after germany 's highest court in february ordered the government to adjust its formula for the jobless benefit known as hartz iv .
previously , adjustments were based on changes in pension payments . merkel " satisfied " party leaders from merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and her free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- coalition partners met sunday with the chancellor to discuss the hartz iv payouts . after infighting over tax breaks , healthcare reform , immigration , conscription and the use of nuclear power , changes to the payments made to long-time unemployed were the latest in the series of disagreements that have divided merkel 's coalition and weakened public support for the government . bildunterschrift : left to right , coalition leaders seehofer , westerwelle and merkel compromised over hartz iv benefits yet the coalition party leaders overcame their differences and appeared pleased with their decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 26.09.2010 prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for schwarzer , headscarves are more than garments - they 're symbols germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "

both the report found that political conviction took a backseat to social motivations in the process of radicalization . desire to fit in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many extremists come from dysfunctional families young people are attracted to the feeling of belonging that a group gives them , rather than to the political viewpoints of the group , according to thomas kliche , a political psychology researcher at the university of hamburg . " the ideology is a very second rate ideology in their biography , " he said .
" at that age they do n't even comprehend the reach of these ideas , they just comprehend , ' the group tells me i 'm fine , the group tells me i 'm strong . " ' but not all young people are equally susceptible to the allure of group identity .
nearly all the extremists interviewed came from dysfunctional families . poor family relations can heighten appeal of the group , kliche said . " most offenders do come from broken homes ... or their family is not able to provide them a feeling of security , of warmth , of being welcome , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is where the group steps in . " something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people who radicalize often end up in jail the report also found that many of those interviewed , in addition to having emotionally or structurally disturbed families , had failed to fit in with society in other ways .
their education or career training had been interrupted or unsuccessful , and they felt they needed to compensate for their shortcomings . according the report , a person 's identification with a particular extremist ideology depended more on coincidence and availability that true political conviction . often , the need to fit in led to violence or drug use .
most of the participants had been involved in delinquent behavior before joining a radical scene , leading the author of the report to conclude that so-called " politically motivated crime " often had no real ideological motivation . author : sarah harman editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a rocky start , the benefits have outweighed the difficulties along the way , she said in a magazine interview . chancellor angela merkel said germany was beginning to reap the benefits of reunification , despite a difficult start for citizens of the former east germany . " for me , the bottom line is that the result of 20 years of unity is essentially positive , " merkel told the german weekly magazine super illu in an interview . merkel , who grew up in east germany , said since 1990 germans in the east have done " unbelievably " well in adjusting to life under the federal constitution of the former west germany . the chancellor admitted reunification had been strange for those living in the eastern states at first , as life changed dramatically . flowering landscapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in east germany badly wanted german unity , merkel said in an interview merkel made reference to the " flowering landscapes " of the east envisioned by former chancellor helmut kohl , who led germany through the reunification process . " during the difficult 1990s it sometimes did n't feel right to talk of flowering landscapes , " said merkel , adding that she believed the description was now a reality in many parts of the former east germany . but some gaps between germany 's eastern and western states remain .
pay in the east is lower while unemployment is higher .
as a result , many young people in the east have moved west in search for jobs . the chancellor pointed out that the majority of people had voted in east german elections for parties in favor of joining a united germany under the existing constitution of the west . merkel was deputy spokeswoman of the eastern pre-unification caretaker government under lothar de maiziere . " the situation was completely clear , " she told the magazine .
" the people had no desire to wait , or to pursue some kind of third way .
they wanted german unity .
that was then our political task and we fulfilled it . " merkel said in the interview that the she believed that the solidarity pact , under which the eastern states still receive aid for development from those in the west , would not need to continue beyond its planned phasing-out in 2019 . the chancellor said she believed that the prosperity levels in the eastern states would approach those in the west by that time . " naturally , after that , a financial adjustment will also exist between the states , " merkel said referring to the normal way in which germany 's states , including those in the west , subsidize each other . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy . the headscarf is more than just a piece of fabric , more than just another article of clothing , and definitely not some hip lifestyle accessory that heavily made-up girls should use to add a little color to their wardrobe .
no , the head scarf is a " flag and symbol of islamists " which " followed a crusade all the way to the heart of europe by the 1980s . "
or so says iconic german feminist alice schwarzer in her new book , " the great cover up : for integration , against islamism " .
the book was recently published in german under the name " die grosse verschleierung : fuer integration , gegen islamismus , " and its strong statements been an injection of yet more fuel into the already burning integration debate in germany .
a ' forceful act ' teachers are no longer allowed to wear the head scarf in german public schools , and now schwarzer has demanded the next step : girls should be forbidden to wear it as well .
bildunterschrift : the veil or scarf can not be dismissed as mere decorative fabric , schwarzer argues " only this forceful act would finally give the young woman from a fundamentalist orthodox family the chance to move with freedom and equality , at least within the confines of the schoolyard , " schwarzer writes .
many readers are likely to react negatively to this demand for a headscarf ban .
in themselves , bans clash with freedoms and rights that are supposed to be self-evident in germany : the right to individual self-determination , the freedom of religion .
so why should n't schoolgirls be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not they want to wear a headscarf to school ?
and would n't a ban serve to agitate exactly those young women who wear their headscarves as a symbol of their islamic identity ?
would n't they find it more important than ever to wear the garment ?
fundamental opposition of rights schwarzer and her co-authors - the book includes articles by a number of journalists and activists - sum up the central conflict as being the opposition between the right to individuality and the right to equality : bildunterschrift : schwarzer argues that girls should have their heads uncovered in school .
" the wearing of the headscarf , which turns the girls into ' strangers ' who are cut off socially and limited physically , comes along with a whole array of special treatments that their parents demand from the school .
it is always a question of dividing the sexes or - insofar as this is refused by the german schools - giving girls special dispensation from swimming class or gym class , from school trips and from sex education classes . "
if the right to individuality is enforced , then the basic right to equality is breached , and the right to equal opportunity is annulled , the argument goes .
islam expert rita breuer spent the year 2009 hanging around german schoolyards .
she contributed an article about the pressure that girls who wear headscarves often put on the students who do n't wear the scarf , making comments like : " are you trying to look like a german ? " or " the headscarf is our honor - do n't you have any ? "
such schoolyard discussions are then padded out with koran commentaries , fatwas - islamic legal pronouncements - sermons or in the internet , breuer says .
in these places , she adds , " islamic woman 's clothing is propagated as the embodiment of her protection and her dignity , whereas the western alternatives are seen as heinous and disgraceful -lsb- … -rsb- i see no trace of girls having the ' freedom to decide ' whether or not to wear the headscarf , which we so much like to suggest . "
alarmist message , balanced with facts according to the book , fundamentalists are on the march in germany .
and the real problem , schwarzer says , is the " systematic undermining of our educational apparatus and the legal system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book has unleashed more debate on an already hot topic amidst such alarmist tones , it is almost surprising to find in the book a few sober facts that the journalist picked up from a recent study on muslim women in germany .
for one : just a small minority of them actually wear a headscarf .
even among those who consider themselves " very religious , " just half of the respondents said they covered their heads .
which means , conversely , that the vast majority of muslims distance themselves from the fundamentalist dress code .
and therefore from the islamic organizations that dictate headscarves should be worn .
schwarzer 's aim is to take up a conversation with this large-but-quiet majority of muslim women , and give them support .
up to now , schwarzer says , germany practiced " false dialogue " and " false tolerance . "
dialog partners have been mostly representatives of fundamentalist organizations , and their demands have mostly been met , based on a fear of accusations of racism .
sisters for the cause bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer wants a ban on headscarves in german schools in certain muslim authors , such as djemila benhabib , schwarzer has found credible and vocal co-combatants in the fight against headscarves , sharia law , and the oppression of women .
benhabib grew up in algeria , then went into exile in paris and canada .
today , the author and journalist works for the canadian government .
in schwarzer 's book she describes how she once dared to walk through the streets of algeria without a veil , despite threats from the armed islamist group gia , essentially putting her life on the line .
the lesson she took out of this can not be stated more clearly : " when religion rules over the state and society , we no longer move in the realm of possibility .
we ca n't ask questions . … only through separation of religion and state is it possible to find common ground .
let 's call it the civic reference framework - far away from belief and disbelief - that is needed to create a civil society . "
germany could also learn a thing or two about civil society , and not only in terms of how it deals with muslims .
germany itself is far from having a complete separation of church and state .
should a headscarf ban in schools ever make it into the german lawbooks , there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss the banning , or not-banning , of symbols from other religions .
there is already a legal decision that bans the display of christian crosses in schools in germany .
but in practice , its effects have been marginal .

both the report found that political conviction took a backseat to social motivations in the process of radicalization . desire to fit in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many extremists come from dysfunctional families young people are attracted to the feeling of belonging that a group gives them , rather than to the political viewpoints of the group , according to thomas kliche , a political psychology researcher at the university of hamburg . " the ideology is a very second rate ideology in their biography , " he said .
" at that age they do n't even comprehend the reach of these ideas , they just comprehend , ' the group tells me i 'm fine , the group tells me i 'm strong . " ' but not all young people are equally susceptible to the allure of group identity .
nearly all the extremists interviewed came from dysfunctional families . poor family relations can heighten appeal of the group , kliche said . " most offenders do come from broken homes ... or their family is not able to provide them a feeling of security , of warmth , of being welcome , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is where the group steps in . " something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people who radicalize often end up in jail the report also found that many of those interviewed , in addition to having emotionally or structurally disturbed families , had failed to fit in with society in other ways .
their education or career training had been interrupted or unsuccessful , and they felt they needed to compensate for their shortcomings . according the report , a person 's identification with a particular extremist ideology depended more on coincidence and availability that true political conviction . often , the need to fit in led to violence or drug use .
most of the participants had been involved in delinquent behavior before joining a radical scene , leading the author of the report to conclude that so-called " politically motivated crime " often had no real ideological motivation . author : sarah harman editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
