program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 29.11.2010 readers affirm swiss deportation referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 52 percent of voters backed the initiative dw readers come down clearly in favor of the swiss referendum to enact stricter deportation laws .
foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan switzerland has approved a plan to automatically deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes .
the proposal , put forth by the nationalist swiss people ’ s party , has been criticized by human rights groups .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

meanwhile , fears remain over the risks posed by computerized , high-frequency trading systems . the frankfurt stock exchange has paved the way for a speedy migration from traditional floor trading towards a fully electronic platform for buying and selling shares and bonds . frankfurt 's xontro floor-based trading system will be replaced by xetra – a computer-based platform developed by the exchange 's operator , deutsche boerse - by may 23 , 2011 . electronic trading is increasingly dominating financial markets , bolstered by the proliferation of computerized trading systems , which use mathematical algorithms to power dealing strategies independent of the human hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer riess says xetra will increase efficiency at the frankfurt stock exchange rainer riess , a member of the management board of the frankfurt stock exchange and managing director of xetra market development at deutsche boerse , said the migration to the xetra electronic platform would make the market more efficient and reduce financial risks . market demands electronic trading des peck , head of marketing at atrium network , a low latency connectivity provider in london , said the move by the frankfurt stock exchange was an " interesting counterpoint " to recent comments made by finance minister of france christine lagarde , who called for more regulation of high frequency trading , which is powered by computers . " the frankfurt stock exchange was one of the last bastions in floor-based trading in cash equities , " peck told deutsche welle . " what we are seeing is an exchange responding to client demand for electronic market places yet at the same time we still have politicians calling for stringent regulation of high-frequency trading . " germany led the way the rapid growth of electronic trading in global financial markets began in germany in january 1990 , when deutsche terminboerse -lrb- dtb -rrb- , the frankfurt-based derivatives exchange now rebranded as eurex , first introduced its electronic trading system . the dtb ’ s adoption of a screen-based , electronic trading platform enabled it to wrestle complete control of the lucrative bund contract for german government bonds from its arch-rival , the london international financial futures and options exchange -lrb- liffe -rrb- , by april 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt is home to germany 's biggest market for shares and bonds artur fischer , joint-ceo at boerse berlin equiduct trading , was an intimate observer of the early adoption of electronic trading and the dtb ’ s fierce struggle with liffe . " when the bund contract moved from liffe to the dtb it was an historic event which changed the world of derivatives trading at that point in time completely , " fischer said . " it shows that if deutsche boerse intends to do something it is quite capable of actually achieving it . " ' flash crash ' in may this year , a highly publicized " flash crash " resulted in the dow jones industrial average plunging nearly 1,000 points in 20 minutes .
the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , a us financial regulator , has since piloted " circuit breakers " , which halt trading if prices move 10 percent or more within a rolling five-minute period . fischer of boerse berlin equiduct trading said the pan-european trading platform has " market breakers " in place , which check if traded market prices can be justified by market conditions . " if we had a situation like the flash crash , we would have intervened and stopped those trades because they were not reflecting market conditions , " he said . bob giffords , an independent banking and technology analyst based in the uk , said the ' flash crash ' on the dow showed that most algorithms were still not sufficiently developed to take a balanced view in " highly disruptive " market conditions . " they are calibrated for normal conditions but not for the extreme volatility of market crashes , which are pretty impossible to simulate anyway , " said giffords . " a human being can react to the full richness of what is happening whereas algorithms tend to be quite limited at what they look at , and so in chaotic moments may fall apart or rush into crowded trades .
in such circumstances a sensible trader should switch them off . " bildunterschrift : from may 2011 , all frankfurt trading will take place via the xetra system .
the implementation of the state-of-the-art platform marks another milestone in the growth of electronic trading regional exchanges ' polarized ' a senior official at a major regional exchange in germany said deutsche boerse ’ s decision to switch all trading to the xetra electronic platform would " polarize " the business of trading in germany by increasing trading costs at regional exchanges throughout the country . " currently the cost-base is shared by all seven -lsb- regional -rsb- exchanges including deutsche boerse , which carries the majority of the costs .
by moving out of xontro and just using xetra , deutsche boerse will have cost savings but the regional exchanges will have more costs to pay .
this will force the exchanges to move much closer together to overcome the cost disadvantage , " the official , who did not wish to be named , told deutsche welle . germany has regional exchanges in bremen , berlin , dusseldorf , munich and stuttgart .
the hamburg and hanover stock exchanges merged in 1999 to form böag boersen ag . riess from the frankfurt stock exchange , said : " given the size of deutsche boerse we have served a higher cost burden in that operation in the past and by decreasing our participation in this venture obviously others will have to pay more according to their usage . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brokers rarely engage in yelling matches in frankfurt anymore legal change the senior regional exchange official added that the migration from xontro to xetra would also change the legal framework under which market makers at the frankfurt exchange operate from public law to civil law . " in the past market makers have been successful in lawsuits against deutsche boerse when the exchange attempted to take away instruments from market makers , " the senior exchange official explained . " by moving everything into civil law -lsb- with the migration to xetra -rsb- , deutsche boerse can now create a contract and market makers will have to either take it or leave it . " riess of the frankfurt stock exchange said : " this allows us to reward specialists for performance and in the interests of investors , rather than to self-service a job profile that may not be up-to-date any more .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

picasso heirs have filed a complaint alleging the works were stolen . an immense collection of 271 previously unknown works by pablo picasso has turned up in southern france , uncovered by a 71-year old retired electrician and his wife .
the couple claims they received the works as gifts from picasso or picasso 's wife .
but picasso 's heirs have filed a complaint alleging the receipt of stolen goods , according to a report in monday 's french newspaper liberation .
the works have a combined estimated worth of some 60 million euros -lrb- about $ 80 million -rrb- .
jean-jaques neuer , a lawyer for the picasso estate , said the couple showed many of the works to picasso 's son claude and other administrators in september in order to have the canvases authenticated .
claude picasso and his employees examined the paintings in paris for more than three hours , and said the works seem to be authentic .
" i was very surprised .
i was very excited to discover works we did n't know about , " said picasso .
he added that he was confused that the paintings were without dates , adding that they should n't have left picasso 's studio .
" those who know my father 's work know that he would systematically put a date on everything , " he said .
works have been seized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picasso 's son said the works should never have left the studio the retired electrician , pierre le guennec , said he had worked for pablo picasso during the last three years of his life , installing alarm systems at his residences .
picasso died in 1973 .
claude picasso has dismissed le guennec 's claim , saying that he could not have received the works as gifts since his father would not have given away such a large quantity of paintings to anyone .
" that does n't stand up , " picasso said .
" it was a part of his life . "
after picasso 's heirs filed the complaint in september , the works were seized from the couple 's home and le guennec was taken into custody . the trove consists of notebooks , drawings and completed paintings .
according to experts , the nine cubist works alone are worth some 40 million euros .
also part of the collection is a watercolor from picasso 's blue period , portraying his first wife olga .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan switzerland has approved a plan to automatically deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes .
the proposal , put forth by the nationalist swiss people ’ s party , has been criticized by human rights groups .

as a compromise , the copenhagen accord saw countries outline their climate protection strategies - but the last-minute document was non-binding and opposed by some developing nations . climate change is real at the opening of the talks , host and mexican president felipe calderon emphasized that the effects of climate change were already being felt , with the most severe hurricanes on record in mexico , flooding in pakistan and the record heat wave that caused forest fires in russia earlier this year .
" climate change is beginning to make us pay for the fatal errors we as humanity have committed against the environment , " he said .
" it 's crucial for the international community to prove that cancun can deliver progress , " eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said in brussels before departing for mexico .
" if not , i fear that some parties would lose patience in the un process , " she warned .
helping developing countries cope with the financial impacts of climate change remains a hot-button issue for negotiators .
international representatives see the two-week talks in cancun as a fresh start and hope concrete steps forward will chew away at the crisis of confidence facing the latest round of negotiations .
way of the mayans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the cancun talks were crucial environmental organizations are also putting more pressure on world governments to work through the deadlock .
the environmental group greenpeace floated a hot air balloon past the nearby mayan ruins of chichen itza , in a symbolic gesture aimed at reminding delegates of the collapse of earlier advanced civilizations . " for all their sophistication , the mayans did not see their destruction coming .
but we can see ours , " the group said in a press release .
development agency oxfam also warned of the risks of inaction at this year 's talks .
" the human impacts of climate change in 2010 send a powerful reminder why progress in cancun is more urgent than ever , " oxfam 's eu climate advisor tim gore said .
the issue of emissions cuts is also getting more targeted attention at the political level .
the european union has encouraged those countries with high greenhouse gas output to rein in emissions .
despite political opposition in congress , us president barack obama has said he will push toward his country 's pledge to slash emissions over the next decade .
the united states is the world 's second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , behind china . but china has not warmed to the prospect of binding emissions reduction targets - despite us calls that beijing commit to cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china emits the most greenhouse gases of any country worldwide national leadership meanwhile , climate experts have called on government leaders to help move the process forward .
stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute for climate impact research pointed to german chancellor angela merkel : " in a situation like this , i believe that what 's needed is strong leadership , especially from those who understand the problems and realize how urgent it is to act , and that this urgency increases with every passing year , " he told deutsche welle .
but merkel has been accused of weak leadership on the climate front by germany 's political opposition , with the green party 's co-leader renate kuenast saying merkel was " never a ' climate chancellor . " '
still , members of merkel 's own conservative christian democrats are holding out hope that the talks in cancun will yield concrete progress .
" anyone who insists it 's too late and nothing can be done needs to explain what the alternative is , " the cdu 's environmental spokesman andreas jung told deutsche welle .
" personally , i believe there is no alternative to negotiations held under un leadership – even if this is a slow process . "

picasso heirs have filed a complaint alleging the works were stolen . an immense collection of 271 previously unknown works by pablo picasso has turned up in southern france , uncovered by a 71-year old retired electrician and his wife .
the couple claims they received the works as gifts from picasso or picasso 's wife .
but picasso 's heirs have filed a complaint alleging the receipt of stolen goods , according to a report in monday 's french newspaper liberation .
the works have a combined estimated worth of some 60 million euros -lrb- about $ 80 million -rrb- .
jean-jaques neuer , a lawyer for the picasso estate , said the couple showed many of the works to picasso 's son claude and other administrators in september in order to have the canvases authenticated .
claude picasso and his employees examined the paintings in paris for more than three hours , and said the works seem to be authentic .
" i was very surprised .
i was very excited to discover works we did n't know about , " said picasso .
he added that he was confused that the paintings were without dates , adding that they should n't have left picasso 's studio .
" those who know my father 's work know that he would systematically put a date on everything , " he said .
works have been seized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picasso 's son said the works should never have left the studio the retired electrician , pierre le guennec , said he had worked for pablo picasso during the last three years of his life , installing alarm systems at his residences .
picasso died in 1973 .
claude picasso has dismissed le guennec 's claim , saying that he could not have received the works as gifts since his father would not have given away such a large quantity of paintings to anyone .
" that does n't stand up , " picasso said .
" it was a part of his life . "
after picasso 's heirs filed the complaint in september , the works were seized from the couple 's home and le guennec was taken into custody . the trove consists of notebooks , drawings and completed paintings .
according to experts , the nine cubist works alone are worth some 40 million euros .
also part of the collection is a watercolor from picasso 's blue period , portraying his first wife olga .

meanwhile there is disappointment for cologne , despite going in front at home to wolfsburg . werder bremen 's hugo almeida took the shine off a glittering performance when he was sent off after scoring a hat trick in his team 's soccer clash with st pauli .
the portuguese striker opened the scoring after just 52 seconds , having received a defence-splitting pass which he slotted past st. pauli keeper thomas kessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli 's markus thorandt followed almeida off the pitch although st pauli quickly responded , an unmarked gerald asamoah hit the bar for the visitors with a header just a minute later , but no equalizer came .
bremen doubled their lead with a swift counter-attack on 20 minutes , when marko marin picked up the ball from a cleared st pauli corner and gave it to almeida , who emerged as the winner once again in a one-on-one with kessler .
bremen struck for the third time in the 64th minute as said hsejinovic played a low ball in to almeida on the left hand side of the box .
almeida slotted the ball through kessler 's legs for his ninth goal of the season .
frayed tempers , red cards glory turned to shame 10 minutes from time for almeida as he elbowed st. pauli central defender carlos zambrano , only to be shown the red card .
" i was being fouled throughout the game and i lost it at that moment , " said almeida , who now faces a ban .
" that should not have happened and i would like to apologise to the team and the fans . "
st pauli were also reduced to 10 men in the last minute as markus thorandt was sent off for a robust tackle on torsten frings , and the final score was 3-0 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novakovich , centre , opened the scoring in cologne 's game the result gives bremen their first win in eight matches in all competitions , following an on-the-pitch scoring drought of 450 minutes , and the victory will take some pressure off long-standing coach thomas schaaf .
cologne 's ' disappointing step in the right direction ' also in sunday 's football action , cologne were held to a 1-1draw at home by wolfsburg and remain in the relegation zone .
milivoje novakovic scored for cologne in the 51st minute , taking advantage after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio was unable to keep a 35-metre free-kick from portuguese midfielder petit under control .
however , wolfsburg substitute cicero put the scores level spectacularly - four minutes after coming onto the pitch - with an overhead kick low into the corner in the 81st minute .
the draw sees cologne move up to 16th place in the table on 12 points , while wolfsburg remain 13th on 16 points .
" it was disappointing not to hold the lead , but it was definitely a step in the right direction , " said cologne coach frank schaefer .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan switzerland has approved a plan to automatically deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 29.11.2010 german government proposal takes aim at internet piracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting illegal downloads is an ongoing challenge berlin is reviewing its approach to fighting illegal downloading in germany , from how it deals with copyright offenders to the penalties they pay for pirating songs , films , texts and other protected materials online . a new 12-point paper released friday by germany 's state minister for culture , bernd neumann , proposes a standard warning system for internet users who illegally download copyrighted material .
the plan envisions an " efficient " system to complement the existing legal framework on internet piracy .
potential copyright violators would receive warning notices , allowing them to cease prohibited downloading " without legal and financial consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann supports " efficient " additions to germany 's current rules on pirated content at the same time , the paper stressed the importance of battling copyright offenses – even citing unesco 's convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions .
" the challenge remains to prevent plagiarism and other copyright infringements , " the government proposal stated .
" the unauthorized uploading and unlawful downloading of works are not trivial offences . " word of warning neumann acknowledged that for the system to be effective , repeat infringements must be met with a serious response .
nevertheless , the warning option would give authorities the chance to explain infringements to offenders without the " immediate threat of penalties . "
it might also prompt internet users to review the security of their wireless connections .
moreover , a standardized procedure could be instituted on a larger scale without putting more pressure on the courts and public prosecutors , according to the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet radio provides a legal alternative for music fans to listen to copyrighted songs once copyright infringements reach the penalty stage , neumann proposed that fines be equivalent to double the normal rights fee , saying a lesser amount would not exceed the cost of obtaining the content legally and thus " create no incentive to follow the law . "
a welcome approach the proposal was well-received by the association of the german music industry -lrb- bvmi -rrb- , as well as the german publishers and booksellers association , which represents some 6,500 companies , shops and representatives .
" in terms of national policy , this paper is a very important step forward , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director .
" it puts the focus on cultural assets and the cultural creative process . "
the proposal reasserted the rights of the copyright holder , rejecting the notion that such laws should be reformulated to benefit consumers of copyrighted materials .
if artists can no longer make a living through creative pursuits , the paper read , the resulting loss of creative diversity would ultimately disadvantage the user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cross-border nature of online piracy requires action at the european level neumann also underscored the need to address the cross-border nature of internet piracy .
an internet user in germany , for instance , might download content from a website with servers based in another country .
" the current agreement on this is not enough , " the paper read .
" concrete measures in germany must be incorporated within the appropriate framework at the european level . "

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan switzerland has approved a plan to automatically deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes .

buying all of postbank , including the costs of acquiring its initial 30 percent stake , is expected to cost deutsche bank at least 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- .
the move allows the german financial giant to add 14 million retail clients to its existing base of about 10 million customers .
it will also add 1,100 branches to deutsche bank 's network , bringing the total number of branches to 2,900 in germany alone .
' balanced earnings mix ' " in the future , the deutsche bank group will have more stable revenues and a more balanced earnings mix , " josef ackermann , chairman of the bank 's management board , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is germany 's largest retail bank with 14 million clients currently , deutsche bank generates more than 80 percent of its profits from investment banking .
last month , the bank – germany 's biggest based on assets – completed its biggest-ever share sale to fund the acquisition and increase reserves ahead of tighter regulations on capital .
postbank will remain an independent brand , with customers experiencing no changes in their daily banking services , deutsche bank said .
the bank added that it will temporarily sell a small portion of postbank shares to bring its stake below 50 percent until us antitrust authorities approve the takeover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.11.2010 elections in egypt test western commitment to democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian voters were turned away from polling booths the polls in egypt have been marred by allegations of vote-rigging and fraud .
now the question is whether western nations step up their support for political reform or simply stand on the sidelines ? the parliamentary elections in egypt had shaped up to be as much an indication of us and european commitment to human rights and democracy as also a dress rehearsal for next year 's egyptian presidential election .
michele dunne , a middle east expert at the carnegie endowment for international peace , said people in egypt and other arab countries were watching the west closely to see to what extent they press for free and fair elections in the arab world 's most populous country .
" they will take that as a sign of whether the us and europe are serious about these issues or whether they have relegated them to the sidelines , " dunne told deutsche welle .
for much of the past year , the us and the european union have largely been quiet about the deterioration of human rights and prospects for real democracy in egypt .
these issues were glaringly absent from us secretary of state hillary clinton 's agenda when she met with egyptian foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit earlier this month in washington .
similarly , egyptian president hosni mubarak 's poor human rights and democracy record has not figured prominently in recent high-level contacts between the eu and egypt .
crackdown on opposition the western stance appears to have led mubarak , in power since 1981 , to conclude that he has a free hand in shaping the electoral process .
for weeks , police and supporters of the muslim brotherhood , the largest opposition movement , have been clashing .
the banned group controls a fifth of the seats in the present parliament by running candidates as independents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-katatni says the police crackdown threatens to turn the polls into a sham according to human rights watch , security forces have so far arrested over 1,300 muslim brotherhood members , including five candidates .
the government has also shut down several independent media organizations .
monitors ?
no , thank you the us had , however , called for free and fair elections . state department spokesman philip crowley appealed to egypt to allow peaceful political gatherings , open media coverage and admit international observers to the polls .
the foreign ministry in cairo countered in a statement that this constituted meddling in egypt 's internal affairs .
" the latest positions taken by the administration toward internal egyptian affairs is something that is absolutely unacceptable , " the foreign ministry said in the statement , quoting an unnamed official .
" it is as if the united states has turned into a caretaker of how egyptian society should conduct its own politics .
whoever thinks that this is possible is deluded . "
the statement said egypt would honor the tradition of mutual respect as long as the united states did the same .
the heated discussion over the egyptian political scene is nothing new and has been going on for some 20 years , said adel iskandar , a professor at georgetown university 's center for contemporary arab studies .
but it was crucial for the us and europe to foster debate about democracy and human rights .
" the regime has taken two steps forward and five steps back , " iskandar told deutsche welle .
" instead of focusing on how much progress has been made , the debate should revolve around how little progress has been achieved . "
weighing the pros and cons it is a fine line , though , considering the volatile , geo-strategic part of the world .
western governments fear that taking egypt to task for its dismal democracy and human rights record could prompt mubarak to withdraw support for the stumbling israeli-palestinian peace process .
egypt also supplies valuable logistics for allied military operations in afghanistan and iraq .
some analysts argue , however , that the long-term risks of the us and europe being perceived as perpetuating authoritarian rule in egypt and elsewhere in the arab world could prove costlier than the short-term benefits of turning a blind eye to flagrant violations of human rights and democratic deficiencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most egyptians think mubarak is grooming his 46-year-old son gamal to take over but edward walker , a former us ambassador to egypt , said changes were up to the egyptian people .
" it is not something that the us can or should dictate , but neither should we be quiet about what we believe in , " walker told deutsche welle .
" so i think it is appropriate for the administration to review what is going on . "
in addition , western powers may just have more leverage than they assume .
analysts said egypt had a vested interest in continued support of us policy in the greater middle east .
the arab nation would not backtrack on support for the israeli-palestinian peace process and risk us congressional favor for its substantial annual aid package .
the government in cairo uses much of the aid to strengthen its domestic security and ability to confront opposition groups .
putting that in jeopardy could spark unrest in the military concerned that it could lose its prerogatives at a time that egypt is gearing up for a battle over who will succeed the country 's octogenarian leader .
the government is also unlikely to risk its control of all us and european democracy and human rights assistance to egyptian non-governmental organizations .
it exercises that control through an agreement with donors that they will only fund ngos , which are officially recognized and authorized by the government .
pivotal presidential elections next year the parliamentary polls are of only moderate importance compared to the presidential elections scheduled for next year that could change egypt 's political landscape , many us and european officials believe .
speculation is rife about whether 82-year-old mubarak , who is in poor health , will run for a sixth six-year term or whether he will push his banker son gamal or his intelligence chief omar suleiman as his successor .
even if mubarak does opt for reelection , it is unlikely that he would be able to serve another full term .
proponents of a more assertive american and european stance said the time will then be ripe to address egypt 's human rights record and stifling of democratic development .
by publicly focusing on the issue , the us and the eu would shape debate in egypt prior to a changing of the guard along the nile , encourage democracy and human rights activists and alter widespread perception in egypt and the rest of the arab world that the united states favors authoritarian rule .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

meanwhile there is disappointment for cologne , despite going in front at home to wolfsburg . werder bremen 's hugo almeida took the shine off a glittering performance when he was sent off after scoring a hat trick in his team 's soccer clash with st pauli .
the portuguese striker opened the scoring after just 52 seconds , having received a defence-splitting pass which he slotted past st. pauli keeper thomas kessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli 's markus thorandt followed almeida off the pitch although st pauli quickly responded , an unmarked gerald asamoah hit the bar for the visitors with a header just a minute later , but no equalizer came .
bremen doubled their lead with a swift counter-attack on 20 minutes , when marko marin picked up the ball from a cleared st pauli corner and gave it to almeida , who emerged as the winner once again in a one-on-one with kessler .
bremen struck for the third time in the 64th minute as said hsejinovic played a low ball in to almeida on the left hand side of the box .
almeida slotted the ball through kessler 's legs for his ninth goal of the season .
frayed tempers , red cards glory turned to shame 10 minutes from time for almeida as he elbowed st. pauli central defender carlos zambrano , only to be shown the red card .
" i was being fouled throughout the game and i lost it at that moment , " said almeida , who now faces a ban .
" that should not have happened and i would like to apologise to the team and the fans . "
st pauli were also reduced to 10 men in the last minute as markus thorandt was sent off for a robust tackle on torsten frings , and the final score was 3-0 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novakovich , centre , opened the scoring in cologne 's game the result gives bremen their first win in eight matches in all competitions , following an on-the-pitch scoring drought of 450 minutes , and the victory will take some pressure off long-standing coach thomas schaaf .
cologne 's ' disappointing step in the right direction ' also in sunday 's football action , cologne were held to a 1-1draw at home by wolfsburg and remain in the relegation zone .
milivoje novakovic scored for cologne in the 51st minute , taking advantage after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio was unable to keep a 35-metre free-kick from portuguese midfielder petit under control .
however , wolfsburg substitute cicero put the scores level spectacularly - four minutes after coming onto the pitch - with an overhead kick low into the corner in the 81st minute .
the draw sees cologne move up to 16th place in the table on 12 points , while wolfsburg remain 13th on 16 points .
" it was disappointing not to hold the lead , but it was definitely a step in the right direction , " said cologne coach frank schaefer .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

buying all of postbank , including the costs of acquiring its initial 30 percent stake , is expected to cost deutsche bank at least 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- .
the move allows the german financial giant to add 14 million retail clients to its existing base of about 10 million customers .
it will also add 1,100 branches to deutsche bank 's network , bringing the total number of branches to 2,900 in germany alone .
' balanced earnings mix ' " in the future , the deutsche bank group will have more stable revenues and a more balanced earnings mix , " josef ackermann , chairman of the bank 's management board , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is germany 's largest retail bank with 14 million clients currently , deutsche bank generates more than 80 percent of its profits from investment banking .
last month , the bank – germany 's biggest based on assets – completed its biggest-ever share sale to fund the acquisition and increase reserves ahead of tighter regulations on capital .
postbank will remain an independent brand , with customers experiencing no changes in their daily banking services , deutsche bank said .
the bank added that it will temporarily sell a small portion of postbank shares to bring its stake below 50 percent until us antitrust authorities approve the takeover .

the plan envisions an " efficient " system to complement the existing legal framework on internet piracy .
potential copyright violators would receive warning notices , allowing them to cease prohibited downloading " without legal and financial consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann supports " efficient " additions to germany 's current rules on pirated content at the same time , the paper stressed the importance of battling copyright offenses – even citing unesco 's convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions .
" the challenge remains to prevent plagiarism and other copyright infringements , " the government proposal stated .
" the unauthorized uploading and unlawful downloading of works are not trivial offences . " word of warning neumann acknowledged that for the system to be effective , repeat infringements must be met with a serious response .
nevertheless , the warning option would give authorities the chance to explain infringements to offenders without the " immediate threat of penalties . "
it might also prompt internet users to review the security of their wireless connections .
moreover , a standardized procedure could be instituted on a larger scale without putting more pressure on the courts and public prosecutors , according to the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet radio provides a legal alternative for music fans to listen to copyrighted songs once copyright infringements reach the penalty stage , neumann proposed that fines be equivalent to double the normal rights fee , saying a lesser amount would not exceed the cost of obtaining the content legally and thus " create no incentive to follow the law . "
a welcome approach the proposal was well-received by the association of the german music industry -lrb- bvmi -rrb- , as well as the german publishers and booksellers association , which represents some 6,500 companies , shops and representatives .
" in terms of national policy , this paper is a very important step forward , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director .
" it puts the focus on cultural assets and the cultural creative process . "
the proposal reasserted the rights of the copyright holder , rejecting the notion that such laws should be reformulated to benefit consumers of copyrighted materials .
if artists can no longer make a living through creative pursuits , the paper read , the resulting loss of creative diversity would ultimately disadvantage the user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cross-border nature of online piracy requires action at the european level neumann also underscored the need to address the cross-border nature of internet piracy .

the tie-up will create europe 's second-largest carrier . after more than two years of negotiations , the five billion euro -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- merger of british airways and iberia was given the green light by shareholders of both airlines on monday , creating europe 's second-biggest carrier after air france-klm .
the combined company will be called international airlines group , but both flag carriers will keep operating under their respective brand names , with dual hubs in london and madrid .
" we are very happy that the shareholders gave their approval to the merger of iberia and british airways , " iberia chairman antonio vazquez , who will also become chairman of the combined group , said in a statement .
" it is certainly to their advantage , since it will bring great value to the business of both airlines and will lead to major synergies , " he added .
' compelling logic ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london heathrow will be one of the hubs of the combined group ba 's chairman martin broughton said the deal had a " compelling , strategic and financial logic " that would benefit staff , passengers and shareholders alike .
ba chief executive willie walsh , who will become ceo of the combined company , said the merger would allow the british airline to compete effectively with low-cost carriers .
ba and iberia also have very few overlapping routes , meaning the two flag carriers complement each other .
iberia has the biggest share of the europe-latin america market and ba is the number-one airline on transatlantic flights and has strong europe-asia connections .
the merger is expected to yield cost savings of 400 million euros after the fifth year .
like many carriers , ba and iberia were faced with slackening demand and heavy losses due to the global credit crunch and started merger talks roughly two years ago .
in june , the tie-up was practically a done deal after ba agreed to a recovery plan for it enormous pension deficit , which had been a major sticking point in the negotiations .
the deal is expected to be finalized in january , when shares in the new , combined company start trading in london and madrid .
ba shareholders will have 56 percent in the new company , while investors in iberia will hold 44 percent .

meanwhile there is disappointment for cologne , despite going in front at home to wolfsburg . werder bremen 's hugo almeida took the shine off a glittering performance when he was sent off after scoring a hat trick in his team 's soccer clash with st pauli .
the portuguese striker opened the scoring after just 52 seconds , having received a defence-splitting pass which he slotted past st. pauli keeper thomas kessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli 's markus thorandt followed almeida off the pitch although st pauli quickly responded , an unmarked gerald asamoah hit the bar for the visitors with a header just a minute later , but no equalizer came .
bremen doubled their lead with a swift counter-attack on 20 minutes , when marko marin picked up the ball from a cleared st pauli corner and gave it to almeida , who emerged as the winner once again in a one-on-one with kessler .
bremen struck for the third time in the 64th minute as said hsejinovic played a low ball in to almeida on the left hand side of the box .
almeida slotted the ball through kessler 's legs for his ninth goal of the season .
frayed tempers , red cards glory turned to shame 10 minutes from time for almeida as he elbowed st. pauli central defender carlos zambrano , only to be shown the red card .
" i was being fouled throughout the game and i lost it at that moment , " said almeida , who now faces a ban .
" that should not have happened and i would like to apologise to the team and the fans . "
st pauli were also reduced to 10 men in the last minute as markus thorandt was sent off for a robust tackle on torsten frings , and the final score was 3-0 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novakovich , centre , opened the scoring in cologne 's game the result gives bremen their first win in eight matches in all competitions , following an on-the-pitch scoring drought of 450 minutes , and the victory will take some pressure off long-standing coach thomas schaaf .
cologne 's ' disappointing step in the right direction ' also in sunday 's football action , cologne were held to a 1-1draw at home by wolfsburg and remain in the relegation zone .
milivoje novakovic scored for cologne in the 51st minute , taking advantage after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio was unable to keep a 35-metre free-kick from portuguese midfielder petit under control .
however , wolfsburg substitute cicero put the scores level spectacularly - four minutes after coming onto the pitch - with an overhead kick low into the corner in the 81st minute .
the draw sees cologne move up to 16th place in the table on 12 points , while wolfsburg remain 13th on 16 points .
" it was disappointing not to hold the lead , but it was definitely a step in the right direction , " said cologne coach frank schaefer .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan switzerland has approved a plan to automatically deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.11.2010 world climate talks kick off in cancun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiators hope to move past failed talks in copenhagen with the summit in cancun one year after efforts to draft a global climate treaty crumbled in copenhagen , negotiators gather at the united nations summit in cancun , mexico , with fresh hopes - but limited expectations . as almost 200 nations gathered in cancun for the first day of climate talks on monday , representatives were focused on securing smaller-scale agreements on issues ranging from deforestation to green technology-sharing , rather than a comprehensive pact on global warming . efforts to hammer out a successor treaty to the kyoto protocol have stalled amid ongoing disagreements on binding emissions cuts - with the last big push to draw up a set of collective targets falling short at the un summit in copenhagen last december .
as a compromise , the copenhagen accord saw countries outline their climate protection strategies - but the last-minute document was non-binding and opposed by some developing nations . climate change is real at the opening of the talks , host and mexican president felipe calderon emphasized that the effects of climate change were already being felt , with the most severe hurricanes on record in mexico , flooding in pakistan and the record heat wave that caused forest fires in russia earlier this year .
" climate change is beginning to make us pay for the fatal errors we as humanity have committed against the environment , " he said .
" it 's crucial for the international community to prove that cancun can deliver progress , " eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said in brussels before departing for mexico .
" if not , i fear that some parties would lose patience in the un process , " she warned .
helping developing countries cope with the financial impacts of climate change remains a hot-button issue for negotiators .
international representatives see the two-week talks in cancun as a fresh start and hope concrete steps forward will chew away at the crisis of confidence facing the latest round of negotiations .
way of the mayans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the cancun talks were crucial environmental organizations are also putting more pressure on world governments to work through the deadlock .
the environmental group greenpeace floated a hot air balloon past the nearby mayan ruins of chichen itza , in a symbolic gesture aimed at reminding delegates of the collapse of earlier advanced civilizations . " for all their sophistication , the mayans did not see their destruction coming .
but we can see ours , " the group said in a press release .
development agency oxfam also warned of the risks of inaction at this year 's talks .
" the human impacts of climate change in 2010 send a powerful reminder why progress in cancun is more urgent than ever , " oxfam 's eu climate advisor tim gore said .
the issue of emissions cuts is also getting more targeted attention at the political level .
the european union has encouraged those countries with high greenhouse gas output to rein in emissions .
despite political opposition in congress , us president barack obama has said he will push toward his country 's pledge to slash emissions over the next decade .
the united states is the world 's second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , behind china . but china has not warmed to the prospect of binding emissions reduction targets - despite us calls that beijing commit to cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china emits the most greenhouse gases of any country worldwide national leadership meanwhile , climate experts have called on government leaders to help move the process forward .
stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute for climate impact research pointed to german chancellor angela merkel : " in a situation like this , i believe that what 's needed is strong leadership , especially from those who understand the problems and realize how urgent it is to act , and that this urgency increases with every passing year , " he told deutsche welle .
but merkel has been accused of weak leadership on the climate front by germany 's political opposition , with the green party 's co-leader renate kuenast saying merkel was " never a ' climate chancellor . " '
still , members of merkel 's own conservative christian democrats are holding out hope that the talks in cancun will yield concrete progress .
" anyone who insists it 's too late and nothing can be done needs to explain what the alternative is , " the cdu 's environmental spokesman andreas jung told deutsche welle .
" personally , i believe there is no alternative to negotiations held under un leadership – even if this is a slow process . "

dw-world.de eu sets sights low for climate talks in the wake of last year 's underwhelming result in copenhagen , the european union is going into the climate talks in cancun with few expectations .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

supply shortages due to the sailors ' strike , some of the islands are already starting to suffer shortages in supplies such as medicine and fresh products .
" it ca n't go on like this , " said yannis diamantidis , a merchant shipping minister .
" there are even five dead bodies which ca n't be taken to their home islands in order to be buried . "
the strike has also stranded sick people who ca n't be taken to specialist clinics in athens ; islands without an airport are especially dependent on the ferry services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek sailors have been striking for a week in crete , furious farmers put up a fight with seamen last friday and saturday since they could not export their perishable goods .
seamen eventually allowed three ferries to clear the port , in a show of goodwill .
the strike began on tuesday last week .
talks between the government and employers have so far failed to break the deadlock .
the sailors have demanded a 2-percent wage increase .
the ferry owners ' union of maritime enterprises -lrb- een -rrb- have said they would only agree to a 0.5 percent increase .
in a statement , they called for sailors to accept the terms in a " joint effort to save the sector . "
other sectors plan to strike greece 's main journalists ' union has called for a 24-hour news blackout on tuesday and public sector doctors have also vowed to walk off their jobs , in support of the striking sailors .
a strike called by the country 's civil aviation workers set for tuesday has been ruled illegal by an athens court and was subsequently cancelled .
unions all over greece are strongly opposed to the government 's austerity measures which have been implemented to slash public spending in exchange for a rescue package from the european union , european central bank and international monetary fund .
unions have called for a nationwide strike in greece on december 15 .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "

government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .

the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .

the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .

" it 's been a fantastic year , i think .
all of the goals that i set for myself , for my career , everything happened this year : to -lsb- become no. 1 in europe -rsb- , to play the ryder cup , and to win a major .
kaymer coasted in on sunday with an unspectacular even-par 72 ; at the end of his round , he said he began to realize what he had accomplished in 2010 .
" as we walked up the 18th , the announcer was saying all the scores , the pga champion , currently no. 1 in europe , and it sounds pretty good to me . it 's a very proud moment . "
kaymer collected a bonus payment of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- for winning the european tour money title , on top of earnings in 2010 that totaled close to 4.5 million euros .
2010 : the year for european golf kaymer 's successes in the golf world this year were part of a flourishing european campaign that saw a victory over the us in the ryder cup team competitions , as well as individual europeans winning three of the four major championships , an unprecedented feat for european golf .
at present , there are more europeans -lrb- six -rrb- in the top-10 of the official world golf rankings , which is likewise something that has never happened before .
england 's lee westwood is currently atop that list , followed by tiger woods , who had previously been ranked no.1 for 266 straight weeks .

china has staked claims to aksai chin in the ladakh region and arunachal pradesh , which beijing refers to as southern tibet . during this new round of talks , india is hoping that china will address the issuing of stapled visas by chinese officials for residents of jammu and kashmir on the ground that the territory is disputed , which as been a serious bone of contention between the two sides . however , china expert srikanth kondapali of the centre for east asian studies is not hopeful about the outcome of the talks and says there has been a change of course . " china in the 1980s and 90s suggested that the kashmir dispute was a bilateral dispute but that the two countries should resolve this dispute peacefully , and both countries should respect the line of control .
these positions appear to have been revised now with china 's active role in kashmir , physically and in terms of policy . "

the process received some impetus after the two countries agreed to hold talks by designated special representatives . ex-foreign secretary shivshankar menon is expected to bring new energy into the current efforts to resolve the complex boundary dispute as he shares a good bond with the top chinese leadership and has spent a considerable part of his diplomatic career in beijing .
he also speaks fluent mandarin . varaprasad shekhar from jawaharlal nehru university points out it will help neither side to have a confrontationist attitude .
" instead of looking at these issues from a very narrow perspective , we need to see the larger picture and try to see how we can resolve the situation .
i think india and china must walk on the path of peace . " a host of other issues including india 's concerns over china 's plans to build a dam over brahmaputra river and the reported presence of chinese personnel for various projects in pakistan-occupied kashmir were expected to figure in the two-day talks . fourth round of strategic dialogue the two countries also held the fourth round of strategic dialogue as part of a wider consultative process to prepare for the visit of premier wen .
" the strategic dialogue process was stalled for various reasons .
india and china have had three strategic dialogues so far .
it includes everything under the sky – bilateral relations , regional security issues and global aspects , " said kondapali . bildunterschrift : tawang monastery is in the north-eastern indian state of arunachal pradesh , which is also claimed by china the endorsement of india 's candidature for a permanent seat in the un security council by us president barrack obama during his recent visit means that china is now the only one of the five veto-wielding members of the united nations security council to not yet have taken a stand on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 29.11.2010 german government proposal takes aim at internet piracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting illegal downloads is an ongoing challenge berlin is reviewing its approach to fighting illegal downloading in germany , from how it deals with copyright offenders to the penalties they pay for pirating songs , films , texts and other protected materials online . a new 12-point paper released friday by germany 's state minister for culture , bernd neumann , proposes a standard warning system for internet users who illegally download copyrighted material .
the plan envisions an " efficient " system to complement the existing legal framework on internet piracy .
potential copyright violators would receive warning notices , allowing them to cease prohibited downloading " without legal and financial consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann supports " efficient " additions to germany 's current rules on pirated content at the same time , the paper stressed the importance of battling copyright offenses – even citing unesco 's convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions .
" the challenge remains to prevent plagiarism and other copyright infringements , " the government proposal stated .
" the unauthorized uploading and unlawful downloading of works are not trivial offences . " word of warning neumann acknowledged that for the system to be effective , repeat infringements must be met with a serious response .
nevertheless , the warning option would give authorities the chance to explain infringements to offenders without the " immediate threat of penalties . "
it might also prompt internet users to review the security of their wireless connections .
moreover , a standardized procedure could be instituted on a larger scale without putting more pressure on the courts and public prosecutors , according to the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet radio provides a legal alternative for music fans to listen to copyrighted songs once copyright infringements reach the penalty stage , neumann proposed that fines be equivalent to double the normal rights fee , saying a lesser amount would not exceed the cost of obtaining the content legally and thus " create no incentive to follow the law . "
a welcome approach the proposal was well-received by the association of the german music industry -lrb- bvmi -rrb- , as well as the german publishers and booksellers association , which represents some 6,500 companies , shops and representatives .
" in terms of national policy , this paper is a very important step forward , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director .
" it puts the focus on cultural assets and the cultural creative process . "
the proposal reasserted the rights of the copyright holder , rejecting the notion that such laws should be reformulated to benefit consumers of copyrighted materials .
if artists can no longer make a living through creative pursuits , the paper read , the resulting loss of creative diversity would ultimately disadvantage the user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cross-border nature of online piracy requires action at the european level neumann also underscored the need to address the cross-border nature of internet piracy .
an internet user in germany , for instance , might download content from a website with servers based in another country .
" the current agreement on this is not enough , " the paper read .
" concrete measures in germany must be incorporated within the appropriate framework at the european level . "

meanwhile there is disappointment for cologne , despite going in front at home to wolfsburg . werder bremen 's hugo almeida took the shine off a glittering performance when he was sent off after scoring a hat trick in his team 's soccer clash with st pauli .
the portuguese striker opened the scoring after just 52 seconds , having received a defence-splitting pass which he slotted past st. pauli keeper thomas kessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli 's markus thorandt followed almeida off the pitch although st pauli quickly responded , an unmarked gerald asamoah hit the bar for the visitors with a header just a minute later , but no equalizer came .
bremen doubled their lead with a swift counter-attack on 20 minutes , when marko marin picked up the ball from a cleared st pauli corner and gave it to almeida , who emerged as the winner once again in a one-on-one with kessler .
bremen struck for the third time in the 64th minute as said hsejinovic played a low ball in to almeida on the left hand side of the box .
almeida slotted the ball through kessler 's legs for his ninth goal of the season .
frayed tempers , red cards glory turned to shame 10 minutes from time for almeida as he elbowed st. pauli central defender carlos zambrano , only to be shown the red card .
" i was being fouled throughout the game and i lost it at that moment , " said almeida , who now faces a ban .
" that should not have happened and i would like to apologise to the team and the fans . "
st pauli were also reduced to 10 men in the last minute as markus thorandt was sent off for a robust tackle on torsten frings , and the final score was 3-0 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novakovich , centre , opened the scoring in cologne 's game the result gives bremen their first win in eight matches in all competitions , following an on-the-pitch scoring drought of 450 minutes , and the victory will take some pressure off long-standing coach thomas schaaf .
cologne 's ' disappointing step in the right direction ' also in sunday 's football action , cologne were held to a 1-1draw at home by wolfsburg and remain in the relegation zone .
milivoje novakovic scored for cologne in the 51st minute , taking advantage after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio was unable to keep a 35-metre free-kick from portuguese midfielder petit under control .
however , wolfsburg substitute cicero put the scores level spectacularly - four minutes after coming onto the pitch - with an overhead kick low into the corner in the 81st minute .
the draw sees cologne move up to 16th place in the table on 12 points , while wolfsburg remain 13th on 16 points .
" it was disappointing not to hold the lead , but it was definitely a step in the right direction , " said cologne coach frank schaefer .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

hundreds of islands are without ferry services to the mainland , with some starting to suffer supply shortages . greece 's socialist government has issued an emergency order to force ferry workers to end their week-long strike .
the greek seamen 's federation announced earlier monday that its week-long strike will continue at least until thursday , leaving hundreds of greek islands without ferry services .
it is the second time during the financial crisis that the government has issued an emergency order which would allow the detention of seamen who do not comply .
supply shortages due to the sailors ' strike , some of the islands are already starting to suffer shortages in supplies such as medicine and fresh products .
" it ca n't go on like this , " said yannis diamantidis , a merchant shipping minister .
" there are even five dead bodies which ca n't be taken to their home islands in order to be buried . "
the strike has also stranded sick people who ca n't be taken to specialist clinics in athens ; islands without an airport are especially dependent on the ferry services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek sailors have been striking for a week in crete , furious farmers put up a fight with seamen last friday and saturday since they could not export their perishable goods .
seamen eventually allowed three ferries to clear the port , in a show of goodwill .
the strike began on tuesday last week .
talks between the government and employers have so far failed to break the deadlock .
the sailors have demanded a 2-percent wage increase .
the ferry owners ' union of maritime enterprises -lrb- een -rrb- have said they would only agree to a 0.5 percent increase .
in a statement , they called for sailors to accept the terms in a " joint effort to save the sector . "
other sectors plan to strike greece 's main journalists ' union has called for a 24-hour news blackout on tuesday and public sector doctors have also vowed to walk off their jobs , in support of the striking sailors .
a strike called by the country 's civil aviation workers set for tuesday has been ruled illegal by an athens court and was subsequently cancelled .
unions all over greece are strongly opposed to the government 's austerity measures which have been implemented to slash public spending in exchange for a rescue package from the european union , european central bank and international monetary fund .
unions have called for a nationwide strike in greece on december 15 .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

meanwhile , fears remain over the risks posed by computerized , high-frequency trading systems . the frankfurt stock exchange has paved the way for a speedy migration from traditional floor trading towards a fully electronic platform for buying and selling shares and bonds . frankfurt 's xontro floor-based trading system will be replaced by xetra – a computer-based platform developed by the exchange 's operator , deutsche boerse - by may 23 , 2011 . electronic trading is increasingly dominating financial markets , bolstered by the proliferation of computerized trading systems , which use mathematical algorithms to power dealing strategies independent of the human hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer riess says xetra will increase efficiency at the frankfurt stock exchange rainer riess , a member of the management board of the frankfurt stock exchange and managing director of xetra market development at deutsche boerse , said the migration to the xetra electronic platform would make the market more efficient and reduce financial risks . market demands electronic trading des peck , head of marketing at atrium network , a low latency connectivity provider in london , said the move by the frankfurt stock exchange was an " interesting counterpoint " to recent comments made by finance minister of france christine lagarde , who called for more regulation of high frequency trading , which is powered by computers . " the frankfurt stock exchange was one of the last bastions in floor-based trading in cash equities , " peck told deutsche welle . " what we are seeing is an exchange responding to client demand for electronic market places yet at the same time we still have politicians calling for stringent regulation of high-frequency trading . " germany led the way the rapid growth of electronic trading in global financial markets began in germany in january 1990 , when deutsche terminboerse -lrb- dtb -rrb- , the frankfurt-based derivatives exchange now rebranded as eurex , first introduced its electronic trading system . the dtb ’ s adoption of a screen-based , electronic trading platform enabled it to wrestle complete control of the lucrative bund contract for german government bonds from its arch-rival , the london international financial futures and options exchange -lrb- liffe -rrb- , by april 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt is home to germany 's biggest market for shares and bonds artur fischer , joint-ceo at boerse berlin equiduct trading , was an intimate observer of the early adoption of electronic trading and the dtb ’ s fierce struggle with liffe . " when the bund contract moved from liffe to the dtb it was an historic event which changed the world of derivatives trading at that point in time completely , " fischer said . " it shows that if deutsche boerse intends to do something it is quite capable of actually achieving it . " ' flash crash ' in may this year , a highly publicized " flash crash " resulted in the dow jones industrial average plunging nearly 1,000 points in 20 minutes .
the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , a us financial regulator , has since piloted " circuit breakers " , which halt trading if prices move 10 percent or more within a rolling five-minute period . fischer of boerse berlin equiduct trading said the pan-european trading platform has " market breakers " in place , which check if traded market prices can be justified by market conditions . " if we had a situation like the flash crash , we would have intervened and stopped those trades because they were not reflecting market conditions , " he said . bob giffords , an independent banking and technology analyst based in the uk , said the ' flash crash ' on the dow showed that most algorithms were still not sufficiently developed to take a balanced view in " highly disruptive " market conditions . " they are calibrated for normal conditions but not for the extreme volatility of market crashes , which are pretty impossible to simulate anyway , " said giffords . " a human being can react to the full richness of what is happening whereas algorithms tend to be quite limited at what they look at , and so in chaotic moments may fall apart or rush into crowded trades .
in such circumstances a sensible trader should switch them off . " bildunterschrift : from may 2011 , all frankfurt trading will take place via the xetra system .
the implementation of the state-of-the-art platform marks another milestone in the growth of electronic trading regional exchanges ' polarized ' a senior official at a major regional exchange in germany said deutsche boerse ’ s decision to switch all trading to the xetra electronic platform would " polarize " the business of trading in germany by increasing trading costs at regional exchanges throughout the country . " currently the cost-base is shared by all seven -lsb- regional -rsb- exchanges including deutsche boerse , which carries the majority of the costs .
by moving out of xontro and just using xetra , deutsche boerse will have cost savings but the regional exchanges will have more costs to pay .
this will force the exchanges to move much closer together to overcome the cost disadvantage , " the official , who did not wish to be named , told deutsche welle . germany has regional exchanges in bremen , berlin , dusseldorf , munich and stuttgart .
the hamburg and hanover stock exchanges merged in 1999 to form böag boersen ag . riess from the frankfurt stock exchange , said : " given the size of deutsche boerse we have served a higher cost burden in that operation in the past and by decreasing our participation in this venture obviously others will have to pay more according to their usage . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brokers rarely engage in yelling matches in frankfurt anymore legal change the senior regional exchange official added that the migration from xontro to xetra would also change the legal framework under which market makers at the frankfurt exchange operate from public law to civil law . " in the past market makers have been successful in lawsuits against deutsche boerse when the exchange attempted to take away instruments from market makers , " the senior exchange official explained . " by moving everything into civil law -lsb- with the migration to xetra -rsb- , deutsche boerse can now create a contract and market makers will have to either take it or leave it . " riess of the frankfurt stock exchange said : " this allows us to reward specialists for performance and in the interests of investors , rather than to self-service a job profile that may not be up-to-date any more .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .

" it 's been a fantastic year , i think .
all of the goals that i set for myself , for my career , everything happened this year : to -lsb- become no. 1 in europe -rsb- , to play the ryder cup , and to win a major .
kaymer coasted in on sunday with an unspectacular even-par 72 ; at the end of his round , he said he began to realize what he had accomplished in 2010 .
" as we walked up the 18th , the announcer was saying all the scores , the pga champion , currently no. 1 in europe , and it sounds pretty good to me . it 's a very proud moment . "
kaymer collected a bonus payment of 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- for winning the european tour money title , on top of earnings in 2010 that totaled close to 4.5 million euros .
2010 : the year for european golf kaymer 's successes in the golf world this year were part of a flourishing european campaign that saw a victory over the us in the ryder cup team competitions , as well as individual europeans winning three of the four major championships , an unprecedented feat for european golf .
at present , there are more europeans -lrb- six -rrb- in the top-10 of the official world golf rankings , which is likewise something that has never happened before .
england 's lee westwood is currently atop that list , followed by tiger woods , who had previously been ranked no.1 for 266 straight weeks .
kaymer is ranked third in the world and is joined by another three englishmen -lrb- ian poulter , paul casey , and luke donald -rrb- and a northern irishman , rory mcilroy , rounding off the top-10 .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

as a compromise , the copenhagen accord saw countries outline their climate protection strategies - but the last-minute document was non-binding and opposed by some developing nations . climate change is real at the opening of the talks , host and mexican president felipe calderon emphasized that the effects of climate change were already being felt , with the most severe hurricanes on record in mexico , flooding in pakistan and the record heat wave that caused forest fires in russia earlier this year .
" climate change is beginning to make us pay for the fatal errors we as humanity have committed against the environment , " he said .
" it 's crucial for the international community to prove that cancun can deliver progress , " eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said in brussels before departing for mexico .
" if not , i fear that some parties would lose patience in the un process , " she warned .
helping developing countries cope with the financial impacts of climate change remains a hot-button issue for negotiators .
international representatives see the two-week talks in cancun as a fresh start and hope concrete steps forward will chew away at the crisis of confidence facing the latest round of negotiations .
way of the mayans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the cancun talks were crucial environmental organizations are also putting more pressure on world governments to work through the deadlock .
the environmental group greenpeace floated a hot air balloon past the nearby mayan ruins of chichen itza , in a symbolic gesture aimed at reminding delegates of the collapse of earlier advanced civilizations . " for all their sophistication , the mayans did not see their destruction coming .
but we can see ours , " the group said in a press release .
development agency oxfam also warned of the risks of inaction at this year 's talks .
" the human impacts of climate change in 2010 send a powerful reminder why progress in cancun is more urgent than ever , " oxfam 's eu climate advisor tim gore said .
the issue of emissions cuts is also getting more targeted attention at the political level .
the european union has encouraged those countries with high greenhouse gas output to rein in emissions .
despite political opposition in congress , us president barack obama has said he will push toward his country 's pledge to slash emissions over the next decade .
the united states is the world 's second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , behind china . but china has not warmed to the prospect of binding emissions reduction targets - despite us calls that beijing commit to cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china emits the most greenhouse gases of any country worldwide national leadership meanwhile , climate experts have called on government leaders to help move the process forward .
stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute for climate impact research pointed to german chancellor angela merkel : " in a situation like this , i believe that what 's needed is strong leadership , especially from those who understand the problems and realize how urgent it is to act , and that this urgency increases with every passing year , " he told deutsche welle .
but merkel has been accused of weak leadership on the climate front by germany 's political opposition , with the green party 's co-leader renate kuenast saying merkel was " never a ' climate chancellor . " '
still , members of merkel 's own conservative christian democrats are holding out hope that the talks in cancun will yield concrete progress .
" anyone who insists it 's too late and nothing can be done needs to explain what the alternative is , " the cdu 's environmental spokesman andreas jung told deutsche welle .
" personally , i believe there is no alternative to negotiations held under un leadership – even if this is a slow process . "

hundreds of islands are without ferry services to the mainland , with some starting to suffer supply shortages . greece 's socialist government has issued an emergency order to force ferry workers to end their week-long strike .
the greek seamen 's federation announced earlier monday that its week-long strike will continue at least until thursday , leaving hundreds of greek islands without ferry services .
it is the second time during the financial crisis that the government has issued an emergency order which would allow the detention of seamen who do not comply .
supply shortages due to the sailors ' strike , some of the islands are already starting to suffer shortages in supplies such as medicine and fresh products .
" it ca n't go on like this , " said yannis diamantidis , a merchant shipping minister .
" there are even five dead bodies which ca n't be taken to their home islands in order to be buried . "
the strike has also stranded sick people who ca n't be taken to specialist clinics in athens ; islands without an airport are especially dependent on the ferry services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek sailors have been striking for a week in crete , furious farmers put up a fight with seamen last friday and saturday since they could not export their perishable goods .
seamen eventually allowed three ferries to clear the port , in a show of goodwill .
the strike began on tuesday last week .
talks between the government and employers have so far failed to break the deadlock .
the sailors have demanded a 2-percent wage increase .
the ferry owners ' union of maritime enterprises -lrb- een -rrb- have said they would only agree to a 0.5 percent increase .
in a statement , they called for sailors to accept the terms in a " joint effort to save the sector . "
other sectors plan to strike greece 's main journalists ' union has called for a 24-hour news blackout on tuesday and public sector doctors have also vowed to walk off their jobs , in support of the striking sailors .
a strike called by the country 's civil aviation workers set for tuesday has been ruled illegal by an athens court and was subsequently cancelled .
unions all over greece are strongly opposed to the government 's austerity measures which have been implemented to slash public spending in exchange for a rescue package from the european union , european central bank and international monetary fund .
unions have called for a nationwide strike in greece on december 15 .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .

the move allows the german financial giant to add 14 million retail clients to its existing base of about 10 million customers .
it will also add 1,100 branches to deutsche bank 's network , bringing the total number of branches to 2,900 in germany alone .
' balanced earnings mix ' " in the future , the deutsche bank group will have more stable revenues and a more balanced earnings mix , " josef ackermann , chairman of the bank 's management board , said in a statement .

last month , the bank – germany 's biggest based on assets – completed its biggest-ever share sale to fund the acquisition and increase reserves ahead of tighter regulations on capital .
postbank will remain an independent brand , with customers experiencing no changes in their daily banking services , deutsche bank said .
the bank added that it will temporarily sell a small portion of postbank shares to bring its stake below 50 percent until us antitrust authorities approve the takeover .

china has staked claims to aksai chin in the ladakh region and arunachal pradesh , which beijing refers to as southern tibet . during this new round of talks , india is hoping that china will address the issuing of stapled visas by chinese officials for residents of jammu and kashmir on the ground that the territory is disputed , which as been a serious bone of contention between the two sides . however , china expert srikanth kondapali of the centre for east asian studies is not hopeful about the outcome of the talks and says there has been a change of course . " china in the 1980s and 90s suggested that the kashmir dispute was a bilateral dispute but that the two countries should resolve this dispute peacefully , and both countries should respect the line of control .
these positions appear to have been revised now with china 's active role in kashmir , physically and in terms of policy . "

the process received some impetus after the two countries agreed to hold talks by designated special representatives . ex-foreign secretary shivshankar menon is expected to bring new energy into the current efforts to resolve the complex boundary dispute as he shares a good bond with the top chinese leadership and has spent a considerable part of his diplomatic career in beijing .
he also speaks fluent mandarin . varaprasad shekhar from jawaharlal nehru university points out it will help neither side to have a confrontationist attitude .
" instead of looking at these issues from a very narrow perspective , we need to see the larger picture and try to see how we can resolve the situation .
i think india and china must walk on the path of peace . " a host of other issues including india 's concerns over china 's plans to build a dam over brahmaputra river and the reported presence of chinese personnel for various projects in pakistan-occupied kashmir were expected to figure in the two-day talks . fourth round of strategic dialogue the two countries also held the fourth round of strategic dialogue as part of a wider consultative process to prepare for the visit of premier wen .

india and china have had three strategic dialogues so far .

as a compromise , the copenhagen accord saw countries outline their climate protection strategies - but the last-minute document was non-binding and opposed by some developing nations . climate change is real at the opening of the talks , host and mexican president felipe calderon emphasized that the effects of climate change were already being felt , with the most severe hurricanes on record in mexico , flooding in pakistan and the record heat wave that caused forest fires in russia earlier this year .
" climate change is beginning to make us pay for the fatal errors we as humanity have committed against the environment , " he said .
" it 's crucial for the international community to prove that cancun can deliver progress , " eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said in brussels before departing for mexico .
" if not , i fear that some parties would lose patience in the un process , " she warned .
helping developing countries cope with the financial impacts of climate change remains a hot-button issue for negotiators .
international representatives see the two-week talks in cancun as a fresh start and hope concrete steps forward will chew away at the crisis of confidence facing the latest round of negotiations .
way of the mayans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the cancun talks were crucial environmental organizations are also putting more pressure on world governments to work through the deadlock .
the environmental group greenpeace floated a hot air balloon past the nearby mayan ruins of chichen itza , in a symbolic gesture aimed at reminding delegates of the collapse of earlier advanced civilizations . " for all their sophistication , the mayans did not see their destruction coming .
but we can see ours , " the group said in a press release .
development agency oxfam also warned of the risks of inaction at this year 's talks .
" the human impacts of climate change in 2010 send a powerful reminder why progress in cancun is more urgent than ever , " oxfam 's eu climate advisor tim gore said .
the issue of emissions cuts is also getting more targeted attention at the political level .
the european union has encouraged those countries with high greenhouse gas output to rein in emissions .
despite political opposition in congress , us president barack obama has said he will push toward his country 's pledge to slash emissions over the next decade .
the united states is the world 's second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , behind china . but china has not warmed to the prospect of binding emissions reduction targets - despite us calls that beijing commit to cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china emits the most greenhouse gases of any country worldwide national leadership meanwhile , climate experts have called on government leaders to help move the process forward .
stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute for climate impact research pointed to german chancellor angela merkel : " in a situation like this , i believe that what 's needed is strong leadership , especially from those who understand the problems and realize how urgent it is to act , and that this urgency increases with every passing year , " he told deutsche welle .
but merkel has been accused of weak leadership on the climate front by germany 's political opposition , with the green party 's co-leader renate kuenast saying merkel was " never a ' climate chancellor . " '
still , members of merkel 's own conservative christian democrats are holding out hope that the talks in cancun will yield concrete progress .
" anyone who insists it 's too late and nothing can be done needs to explain what the alternative is , " the cdu 's environmental spokesman andreas jung told deutsche welle .
" personally , i believe there is no alternative to negotiations held under un leadership – even if this is a slow process . "

picasso heirs have filed a complaint alleging the works were stolen . an immense collection of 271 previously unknown works by pablo picasso has turned up in southern france , uncovered by a 71-year old retired electrician and his wife .
the couple claims they received the works as gifts from picasso or picasso 's wife .
but picasso 's heirs have filed a complaint alleging the receipt of stolen goods , according to a report in monday 's french newspaper liberation .
the works have a combined estimated worth of some 60 million euros -lrb- about $ 80 million -rrb- .
jean-jaques neuer , a lawyer for the picasso estate , said the couple showed many of the works to picasso 's son claude and other administrators in september in order to have the canvases authenticated .
claude picasso and his employees examined the paintings in paris for more than three hours , and said the works seem to be authentic .
" i was very surprised .
i was very excited to discover works we did n't know about , " said picasso .
he added that he was confused that the paintings were without dates , adding that they should n't have left picasso 's studio .
" those who know my father 's work know that he would systematically put a date on everything , " he said .
works have been seized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picasso 's son said the works should never have left the studio the retired electrician , pierre le guennec , said he had worked for pablo picasso during the last three years of his life , installing alarm systems at his residences .
picasso died in 1973 .
claude picasso has dismissed le guennec 's claim , saying that he could not have received the works as gifts since his father would not have given away such a large quantity of paintings to anyone .
" that does n't stand up , " picasso said .
" it was a part of his life . "
after picasso 's heirs filed the complaint in september , the works were seized from the couple 's home and le guennec was taken into custody . the trove consists of notebooks , drawings and completed paintings .
according to experts , the nine cubist works alone are worth some 40 million euros .
also part of the collection is a watercolor from picasso 's blue period , portraying his first wife olga .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.11.2010 elections in egypt test western commitment to democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian voters were turned away from polling booths the polls in egypt have been marred by allegations of vote-rigging and fraud .
now the question is whether western nations step up their support for political reform or simply stand on the sidelines ? the parliamentary elections in egypt had shaped up to be as much an indication of us and european commitment to human rights and democracy as also a dress rehearsal for next year 's egyptian presidential election .
michele dunne , a middle east expert at the carnegie endowment for international peace , said people in egypt and other arab countries were watching the west closely to see to what extent they press for free and fair elections in the arab world 's most populous country .
" they will take that as a sign of whether the us and europe are serious about these issues or whether they have relegated them to the sidelines , " dunne told deutsche welle .
for much of the past year , the us and the european union have largely been quiet about the deterioration of human rights and prospects for real democracy in egypt .
these issues were glaringly absent from us secretary of state hillary clinton 's agenda when she met with egyptian foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit earlier this month in washington .
similarly , egyptian president hosni mubarak 's poor human rights and democracy record has not figured prominently in recent high-level contacts between the eu and egypt .
crackdown on opposition the western stance appears to have led mubarak , in power since 1981 , to conclude that he has a free hand in shaping the electoral process .
for weeks , police and supporters of the muslim brotherhood , the largest opposition movement , have been clashing .
the banned group controls a fifth of the seats in the present parliament by running candidates as independents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-katatni says the police crackdown threatens to turn the polls into a sham according to human rights watch , security forces have so far arrested over 1,300 muslim brotherhood members , including five candidates .
the government has also shut down several independent media organizations .
monitors ?
no , thank you the us had , however , called for free and fair elections . state department spokesman philip crowley appealed to egypt to allow peaceful political gatherings , open media coverage and admit international observers to the polls .
the foreign ministry in cairo countered in a statement that this constituted meddling in egypt 's internal affairs .
" the latest positions taken by the administration toward internal egyptian affairs is something that is absolutely unacceptable , " the foreign ministry said in the statement , quoting an unnamed official .
" it is as if the united states has turned into a caretaker of how egyptian society should conduct its own politics .
whoever thinks that this is possible is deluded . "
the statement said egypt would honor the tradition of mutual respect as long as the united states did the same .
the heated discussion over the egyptian political scene is nothing new and has been going on for some 20 years , said adel iskandar , a professor at georgetown university 's center for contemporary arab studies .
but it was crucial for the us and europe to foster debate about democracy and human rights .
" the regime has taken two steps forward and five steps back , " iskandar told deutsche welle .
" instead of focusing on how much progress has been made , the debate should revolve around how little progress has been achieved . "
weighing the pros and cons it is a fine line , though , considering the volatile , geo-strategic part of the world .
western governments fear that taking egypt to task for its dismal democracy and human rights record could prompt mubarak to withdraw support for the stumbling israeli-palestinian peace process .
egypt also supplies valuable logistics for allied military operations in afghanistan and iraq .
some analysts argue , however , that the long-term risks of the us and europe being perceived as perpetuating authoritarian rule in egypt and elsewhere in the arab world could prove costlier than the short-term benefits of turning a blind eye to flagrant violations of human rights and democratic deficiencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most egyptians think mubarak is grooming his 46-year-old son gamal to take over but edward walker , a former us ambassador to egypt , said changes were up to the egyptian people .
" it is not something that the us can or should dictate , but neither should we be quiet about what we believe in , " walker told deutsche welle .
" so i think it is appropriate for the administration to review what is going on . "
in addition , western powers may just have more leverage than they assume .
analysts said egypt had a vested interest in continued support of us policy in the greater middle east .
the arab nation would not backtrack on support for the israeli-palestinian peace process and risk us congressional favor for its substantial annual aid package .
the government in cairo uses much of the aid to strengthen its domestic security and ability to confront opposition groups .
putting that in jeopardy could spark unrest in the military concerned that it could lose its prerogatives at a time that egypt is gearing up for a battle over who will succeed the country 's octogenarian leader .
the government is also unlikely to risk its control of all us and european democracy and human rights assistance to egyptian non-governmental organizations .
it exercises that control through an agreement with donors that they will only fund ngos , which are officially recognized and authorized by the government .
pivotal presidential elections next year the parliamentary polls are of only moderate importance compared to the presidential elections scheduled for next year that could change egypt 's political landscape , many us and european officials believe .
speculation is rife about whether 82-year-old mubarak , who is in poor health , will run for a sixth six-year term or whether he will push his banker son gamal or his intelligence chief omar suleiman as his successor .
even if mubarak does opt for reelection , it is unlikely that he would be able to serve another full term .
proponents of a more assertive american and european stance said the time will then be ripe to address egypt 's human rights record and stifling of democratic development .
by publicly focusing on the issue , the us and the eu would shape debate in egypt prior to a changing of the guard along the nile , encourage democracy and human rights activists and alter widespread perception in egypt and the rest of the arab world that the united states favors authoritarian rule .

buying all of postbank , including the costs of acquiring its initial 30 percent stake , is expected to cost deutsche bank at least 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- .
the move allows the german financial giant to add 14 million retail clients to its existing base of about 10 million customers .
it will also add 1,100 branches to deutsche bank 's network , bringing the total number of branches to 2,900 in germany alone .
' balanced earnings mix ' " in the future , the deutsche bank group will have more stable revenues and a more balanced earnings mix , " josef ackermann , chairman of the bank 's management board , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is germany 's largest retail bank with 14 million clients currently , deutsche bank generates more than 80 percent of its profits from investment banking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 29.11.2010 german government proposal takes aim at internet piracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting illegal downloads is an ongoing challenge berlin is reviewing its approach to fighting illegal downloading in germany , from how it deals with copyright offenders to the penalties they pay for pirating songs , films , texts and other protected materials online . a new 12-point paper released friday by germany 's state minister for culture , bernd neumann , proposes a standard warning system for internet users who illegally download copyrighted material .
the plan envisions an " efficient " system to complement the existing legal framework on internet piracy .
potential copyright violators would receive warning notices , allowing them to cease prohibited downloading " without legal and financial consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann supports " efficient " additions to germany 's current rules on pirated content at the same time , the paper stressed the importance of battling copyright offenses – even citing unesco 's convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions .
" the challenge remains to prevent plagiarism and other copyright infringements , " the government proposal stated .
" the unauthorized uploading and unlawful downloading of works are not trivial offences . " word of warning neumann acknowledged that for the system to be effective , repeat infringements must be met with a serious response .
nevertheless , the warning option would give authorities the chance to explain infringements to offenders without the " immediate threat of penalties . "
it might also prompt internet users to review the security of their wireless connections .
moreover , a standardized procedure could be instituted on a larger scale without putting more pressure on the courts and public prosecutors , according to the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet radio provides a legal alternative for music fans to listen to copyrighted songs once copyright infringements reach the penalty stage , neumann proposed that fines be equivalent to double the normal rights fee , saying a lesser amount would not exceed the cost of obtaining the content legally and thus " create no incentive to follow the law . "
a welcome approach the proposal was well-received by the association of the german music industry -lrb- bvmi -rrb- , as well as the german publishers and booksellers association , which represents some 6,500 companies , shops and representatives .
" in terms of national policy , this paper is a very important step forward , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director .
" it puts the focus on cultural assets and the cultural creative process . "
the proposal reasserted the rights of the copyright holder , rejecting the notion that such laws should be reformulated to benefit consumers of copyrighted materials .
if artists can no longer make a living through creative pursuits , the paper read , the resulting loss of creative diversity would ultimately disadvantage the user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cross-border nature of online piracy requires action at the european level neumann also underscored the need to address the cross-border nature of internet piracy .
an internet user in germany , for instance , might download content from a website with servers based in another country .
" the current agreement on this is not enough , " the paper read .
" concrete measures in germany must be incorporated within the appropriate framework at the european level . "

" planet eden : the world of tomorrow in socialist czechoslovakia 1948 to 1978 " features magazines , books , films , posters , paintings and toys , offering a comprehensive overview of the science fiction produced in the country at that time .
in the 1950s in particular , the all-powerful communist party sought to impose its ideology on the population , pushing the promise that utopia was on its way .
such propaganda also infiltrated the burgeoning sci-fi genre , leading to bright visions of a post-capitalist world .
by the same token , exploring the concept of dystopia , of a nightmare future full of fear and devoid of personal freedom , was out of the question for czechoslovak writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech sci-fi was full of utopian space imagery " that was quite different from the vision of the future in western sci-fi , where we can find many dark visions of the future , " said tomas pospiszyl , planet eden 's co-curator , in an interview with deutsche welle .
a soviet bloc-wide vision many authors took inspiration from other eastern bloc writers , including the great polish futurologist stanislav lem , and russia 's boris and arkady strugatsky , whose novel " roadside picnic " provided the basis for andrei tarkovsky 's classic movie stalker .
" unlike western science fiction , which was more plot-oriented , czech writers tended to be more oriented to ideas , and maybe moral issues , " added ivan adamovic , another curator at the show .
it was not until the 1960s that they devoted more attention to action and gripping plots , he noted .
pospiszyl also pointed out the emphasis on the positive posed particular difficulties in creating plot lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rockets and spaceships easily integrated into urban life " it was actually quite a problem for writers and artists of that time to even find dramatic situations , " he said .
" because the future was supposed to be optimistic and great .
they found a solution in ceding little pockets of capitalism that somehow travelled in time , or were rediscovered in the future . "
needless to say , the ussr had a strong influence on the sci-fi produced in one of its satellite states .
" especially in the 1950s , many czechoslovak illustrators were even afraid to develop their own images , " pospiszyl observed .
" quite often they were recycling or using elements that they could find in soviet magazines of that time .
we can see one type of spaceship used all over , and the original source is znanie sila -lsb- knowledge is power -rsb- magazine . "
eventually a relative easing of political repression , combined with the grim reality of life under communism , did lead to a reduction in the party-line optimism previously seen in czechoslovak sci-fi .
" it came in the second half of the 1960s , when people realised we would not reach communism within the 20th century , " adamovic said .
" also they noticed that technological progress will not solve everything , as they thought before . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the artwork predicted chess-playing robots , albeit not in the form that turned out czech cosmonaut marks end of show running on a video screen at planet eden is looped footage of the chubby and balding vladimir remek arriving back on earth after taking part in the russian soyuz 28 mission in 1978 , when he became the first , and only , czech cosmonaut .
the year of the spaceflight made by remek - who is today a communist mep - was chosen to bookend the exhibition for a reason , adamovic also pointed out .
" it was a tragic image , which did n't fit the previous , optimistic visions of how the heroes of space would look , " he said . " he was not anything like some kind of superhero in a spacesuit .
he lived so long in the soviet union that he almost forgot how to speak czech -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
people laughed when they heard him speaking , in fact . "
the exhibition runs at the dox gallery in prague until december 13 , 2010 .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hundreds of islands are without ferry services to the mainland , with some starting to suffer supply shortages . greece 's socialist government has issued an emergency order to force ferry workers to end their week-long strike .
the greek seamen 's federation announced earlier monday that its week-long strike will continue at least until thursday , leaving hundreds of greek islands without ferry services .
it is the second time during the financial crisis that the government has issued an emergency order which would allow the detention of seamen who do not comply .
supply shortages due to the sailors ' strike , some of the islands are already starting to suffer shortages in supplies such as medicine and fresh products .
" it ca n't go on like this , " said yannis diamantidis , a merchant shipping minister .
" there are even five dead bodies which ca n't be taken to their home islands in order to be buried . "
the strike has also stranded sick people who ca n't be taken to specialist clinics in athens ; islands without an airport are especially dependent on the ferry services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek sailors have been striking for a week in crete , furious farmers put up a fight with seamen last friday and saturday since they could not export their perishable goods .
seamen eventually allowed three ferries to clear the port , in a show of goodwill .
the strike began on tuesday last week .
talks between the government and employers have so far failed to break the deadlock .
the sailors have demanded a 2-percent wage increase .
the ferry owners ' union of maritime enterprises -lrb- een -rrb- have said they would only agree to a 0.5 percent increase .

china has staked claims to aksai chin in the ladakh region and arunachal pradesh , which beijing refers to as southern tibet . during this new round of talks , india is hoping that china will address the issuing of stapled visas by chinese officials for residents of jammu and kashmir on the ground that the territory is disputed , which as been a serious bone of contention between the two sides . however , china expert srikanth kondapali of the centre for east asian studies is not hopeful about the outcome of the talks and says there has been a change of course . " china in the 1980s and 90s suggested that the kashmir dispute was a bilateral dispute but that the two countries should resolve this dispute peacefully , and both countries should respect the line of control .
these positions appear to have been revised now with china 's active role in kashmir , physically and in terms of policy . "

the process received some impetus after the two countries agreed to hold talks by designated special representatives . ex-foreign secretary shivshankar menon is expected to bring new energy into the current efforts to resolve the complex boundary dispute as he shares a good bond with the top chinese leadership and has spent a considerable part of his diplomatic career in beijing .
he also speaks fluent mandarin . varaprasad shekhar from jawaharlal nehru university points out it will help neither side to have a confrontationist attitude .
" instead of looking at these issues from a very narrow perspective , we need to see the larger picture and try to see how we can resolve the situation .
i think india and china must walk on the path of peace . " a host of other issues including india 's concerns over china 's plans to build a dam over brahmaputra river and the reported presence of chinese personnel for various projects in pakistan-occupied kashmir were expected to figure in the two-day talks . fourth round of strategic dialogue the two countries also held the fourth round of strategic dialogue as part of a wider consultative process to prepare for the visit of premier wen .
" the strategic dialogue process was stalled for various reasons .
india and china have had three strategic dialogues so far .
it includes everything under the sky – bilateral relations , regional security issues and global aspects , " said kondapali . bildunterschrift : tawang monastery is in the north-eastern indian state of arunachal pradesh , which is also claimed by china the endorsement of india 's candidature for a permanent seat in the un security council by us president barrack obama during his recent visit means that china is now the only one of the five veto-wielding members of the united nations security council to not yet have taken a stand on the issue .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

bremen doubled their lead with a swift counter-attack on 20 minutes , when marko marin picked up the ball from a cleared st pauli corner and gave it to almeida , who emerged as the winner once again in a one-on-one with kessler .
bremen struck for the third time in the 64th minute as said hsejinovic played a low ball in to almeida on the left hand side of the box .
almeida slotted the ball through kessler 's legs for his ninth goal of the season .
frayed tempers , red cards glory turned to shame 10 minutes from time for almeida as he elbowed st. pauli central defender carlos zambrano , only to be shown the red card .
" i was being fouled throughout the game and i lost it at that moment , " said almeida , who now faces a ban .
" that should not have happened and i would like to apologise to the team and the fans . "

milivoje novakovic scored for cologne in the 51st minute , taking advantage after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio was unable to keep a 35-metre free-kick from portuguese midfielder petit under control .
however , wolfsburg substitute cicero put the scores level spectacularly - four minutes after coming onto the pitch - with an overhead kick low into the corner in the 81st minute .
the draw sees cologne move up to 16th place in the table on 12 points , while wolfsburg remain 13th on 16 points .
" it was disappointing not to hold the lead , but it was definitely a step in the right direction , " said cologne coach frank schaefer .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tie-up will create europe 's second-largest carrier . after more than two years of negotiations , the five billion euro -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- merger of british airways and iberia was given the green light by shareholders of both airlines on monday , creating europe 's second-biggest carrier after air france-klm .
the combined company will be called international airlines group , but both flag carriers will keep operating under their respective brand names , with dual hubs in london and madrid .
" we are very happy that the shareholders gave their approval to the merger of iberia and british airways , " iberia chairman antonio vazquez , who will also become chairman of the combined group , said in a statement .
" it is certainly to their advantage , since it will bring great value to the business of both airlines and will lead to major synergies , " he added .
' compelling logic ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london heathrow will be one of the hubs of the combined group ba 's chairman martin broughton said the deal had a " compelling , strategic and financial logic " that would benefit staff , passengers and shareholders alike .
ba chief executive willie walsh , who will become ceo of the combined company , said the merger would allow the british airline to compete effectively with low-cost carriers .
ba and iberia also have very few overlapping routes , meaning the two flag carriers complement each other .
iberia has the biggest share of the europe-latin america market and ba is the number-one airline on transatlantic flights and has strong europe-asia connections .
the merger is expected to yield cost savings of 400 million euros after the fifth year .
like many carriers , ba and iberia were faced with slackening demand and heavy losses due to the global credit crunch and started merger talks roughly two years ago .
in june , the tie-up was practically a done deal after ba agreed to a recovery plan for it enormous pension deficit , which had been a major sticking point in the negotiations .
the deal is expected to be finalized in january , when shares in the new , combined company start trading in london and madrid .
ba shareholders will have 56 percent in the new company , while investors in iberia will hold 44 percent .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

china has staked claims to aksai chin in the ladakh region and arunachal pradesh , which beijing refers to as southern tibet . during this new round of talks , india is hoping that china will address the issuing of stapled visas by chinese officials for residents of jammu and kashmir on the ground that the territory is disputed , which as been a serious bone of contention between the two sides . however , china expert srikanth kondapali of the centre for east asian studies is not hopeful about the outcome of the talks and says there has been a change of course . " china in the 1980s and 90s suggested that the kashmir dispute was a bilateral dispute but that the two countries should resolve this dispute peacefully , and both countries should respect the line of control .
these positions appear to have been revised now with china 's active role in kashmir , physically and in terms of policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are always smiles when the leaders of india and china meet but the border dispute rankles behind the scenes bringing new energy to a slow process although india and china launched discussions to resolve the border dispute in 1980 , progress has been slow .
the process received some impetus after the two countries agreed to hold talks by designated special representatives . ex-foreign secretary shivshankar menon is expected to bring new energy into the current efforts to resolve the complex boundary dispute as he shares a good bond with the top chinese leadership and has spent a considerable part of his diplomatic career in beijing .
he also speaks fluent mandarin . varaprasad shekhar from jawaharlal nehru university points out it will help neither side to have a confrontationist attitude .
" instead of looking at these issues from a very narrow perspective , we need to see the larger picture and try to see how we can resolve the situation .
i think india and china must walk on the path of peace . " a host of other issues including india 's concerns over china 's plans to build a dam over brahmaputra river and the reported presence of chinese personnel for various projects in pakistan-occupied kashmir were expected to figure in the two-day talks . fourth round of strategic dialogue the two countries also held the fourth round of strategic dialogue as part of a wider consultative process to prepare for the visit of premier wen .
" the strategic dialogue process was stalled for various reasons .
india and china have had three strategic dialogues so far .
it includes everything under the sky – bilateral relations , regional security issues and global aspects , " said kondapali . bildunterschrift : tawang monastery is in the north-eastern indian state of arunachal pradesh , which is also claimed by china the endorsement of india 's candidature for a permanent seat in the un security council by us president barrack obama during his recent visit means that china is now the only one of the five veto-wielding members of the united nations security council to not yet have taken a stand on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 29.11.2010 german government proposal takes aim at internet piracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting illegal downloads is an ongoing challenge berlin is reviewing its approach to fighting illegal downloading in germany , from how it deals with copyright offenders to the penalties they pay for pirating songs , films , texts and other protected materials online . a new 12-point paper released friday by germany 's state minister for culture , bernd neumann , proposes a standard warning system for internet users who illegally download copyrighted material .
the plan envisions an " efficient " system to complement the existing legal framework on internet piracy .
potential copyright violators would receive warning notices , allowing them to cease prohibited downloading " without legal and financial consequences . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neumann supports " efficient " additions to germany 's current rules on pirated content at the same time , the paper stressed the importance of battling copyright offenses – even citing unesco 's convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions .
" the challenge remains to prevent plagiarism and other copyright infringements , " the government proposal stated .
" the unauthorized uploading and unlawful downloading of works are not trivial offences . " word of warning neumann acknowledged that for the system to be effective , repeat infringements must be met with a serious response .
nevertheless , the warning option would give authorities the chance to explain infringements to offenders without the " immediate threat of penalties . "
it might also prompt internet users to review the security of their wireless connections .
moreover , a standardized procedure could be instituted on a larger scale without putting more pressure on the courts and public prosecutors , according to the document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet radio provides a legal alternative for music fans to listen to copyrighted songs once copyright infringements reach the penalty stage , neumann proposed that fines be equivalent to double the normal rights fee , saying a lesser amount would not exceed the cost of obtaining the content legally and thus " create no incentive to follow the law . "
a welcome approach the proposal was well-received by the association of the german music industry -lrb- bvmi -rrb- , as well as the german publishers and booksellers association , which represents some 6,500 companies , shops and representatives .
" in terms of national policy , this paper is a very important step forward , " said alexander skipis , the association 's director .
" it puts the focus on cultural assets and the cultural creative process . "
the proposal reasserted the rights of the copyright holder , rejecting the notion that such laws should be reformulated to benefit consumers of copyrighted materials .
if artists can no longer make a living through creative pursuits , the paper read , the resulting loss of creative diversity would ultimately disadvantage the user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cross-border nature of online piracy requires action at the european level neumann also underscored the need to address the cross-border nature of internet piracy .
an internet user in germany , for instance , might download content from a website with servers based in another country .
" the current agreement on this is not enough , " the paper read .
" concrete measures in germany must be incorporated within the appropriate framework at the european level . "

" planet eden : the world of tomorrow in socialist czechoslovakia 1948 to 1978 " features magazines , books , films , posters , paintings and toys , offering a comprehensive overview of the science fiction produced in the country at that time .
in the 1950s in particular , the all-powerful communist party sought to impose its ideology on the population , pushing the promise that utopia was on its way .
such propaganda also infiltrated the burgeoning sci-fi genre , leading to bright visions of a post-capitalist world .
by the same token , exploring the concept of dystopia , of a nightmare future full of fear and devoid of personal freedom , was out of the question for czechoslovak writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech sci-fi was full of utopian space imagery " that was quite different from the vision of the future in western sci-fi , where we can find many dark visions of the future , " said tomas pospiszyl , planet eden 's co-curator , in an interview with deutsche welle .
a soviet bloc-wide vision many authors took inspiration from other eastern bloc writers , including the great polish futurologist stanislav lem , and russia 's boris and arkady strugatsky , whose novel " roadside picnic " provided the basis for andrei tarkovsky 's classic movie stalker .
" unlike western science fiction , which was more plot-oriented , czech writers tended to be more oriented to ideas , and maybe moral issues , " added ivan adamovic , another curator at the show .
it was not until the 1960s that they devoted more attention to action and gripping plots , he noted .
pospiszyl also pointed out the emphasis on the positive posed particular difficulties in creating plot lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rockets and spaceships easily integrated into urban life " it was actually quite a problem for writers and artists of that time to even find dramatic situations , " he said .
" because the future was supposed to be optimistic and great .
they found a solution in ceding little pockets of capitalism that somehow travelled in time , or were rediscovered in the future . "
needless to say , the ussr had a strong influence on the sci-fi produced in one of its satellite states .
" especially in the 1950s , many czechoslovak illustrators were even afraid to develop their own images , " pospiszyl observed .
" quite often they were recycling or using elements that they could find in soviet magazines of that time .
we can see one type of spaceship used all over , and the original source is znanie sila -lsb- knowledge is power -rsb- magazine . "
eventually a relative easing of political repression , combined with the grim reality of life under communism , did lead to a reduction in the party-line optimism previously seen in czechoslovak sci-fi .
" it came in the second half of the 1960s , when people realised we would not reach communism within the 20th century , " adamovic said .
" also they noticed that technological progress will not solve everything , as they thought before . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the artwork predicted chess-playing robots , albeit not in the form that turned out czech cosmonaut marks end of show running on a video screen at planet eden is looped footage of the chubby and balding vladimir remek arriving back on earth after taking part in the russian soyuz 28 mission in 1978 , when he became the first , and only , czech cosmonaut .
the year of the spaceflight made by remek - who is today a communist mep - was chosen to bookend the exhibition for a reason , adamovic also pointed out .
" it was a tragic image , which did n't fit the previous , optimistic visions of how the heroes of space would look , " he said . " he was not anything like some kind of superhero in a spacesuit .
he lived so long in the soviet union that he almost forgot how to speak czech -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
people laughed when they heard him speaking , in fact . "
the exhibition runs at the dox gallery in prague until december 13 , 2010 .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

" planet eden : the world of tomorrow in socialist czechoslovakia 1948 to 1978 " features magazines , books , films , posters , paintings and toys , offering a comprehensive overview of the science fiction produced in the country at that time .
in the 1950s in particular , the all-powerful communist party sought to impose its ideology on the population , pushing the promise that utopia was on its way .
such propaganda also infiltrated the burgeoning sci-fi genre , leading to bright visions of a post-capitalist world .
by the same token , exploring the concept of dystopia , of a nightmare future full of fear and devoid of personal freedom , was out of the question for czechoslovak writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech sci-fi was full of utopian space imagery " that was quite different from the vision of the future in western sci-fi , where we can find many dark visions of the future , " said tomas pospiszyl , planet eden 's co-curator , in an interview with deutsche welle .
a soviet bloc-wide vision many authors took inspiration from other eastern bloc writers , including the great polish futurologist stanislav lem , and russia 's boris and arkady strugatsky , whose novel " roadside picnic " provided the basis for andrei tarkovsky 's classic movie stalker .
" unlike western science fiction , which was more plot-oriented , czech writers tended to be more oriented to ideas , and maybe moral issues , " added ivan adamovic , another curator at the show .
it was not until the 1960s that they devoted more attention to action and gripping plots , he noted .
pospiszyl also pointed out the emphasis on the positive posed particular difficulties in creating plot lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rockets and spaceships easily integrated into urban life " it was actually quite a problem for writers and artists of that time to even find dramatic situations , " he said .
" because the future was supposed to be optimistic and great .
they found a solution in ceding little pockets of capitalism that somehow travelled in time , or were rediscovered in the future . "
needless to say , the ussr had a strong influence on the sci-fi produced in one of its satellite states .
" especially in the 1950s , many czechoslovak illustrators were even afraid to develop their own images , " pospiszyl observed .
" quite often they were recycling or using elements that they could find in soviet magazines of that time .
we can see one type of spaceship used all over , and the original source is znanie sila -lsb- knowledge is power -rsb- magazine . "
eventually a relative easing of political repression , combined with the grim reality of life under communism , did lead to a reduction in the party-line optimism previously seen in czechoslovak sci-fi .
" it came in the second half of the 1960s , when people realised we would not reach communism within the 20th century , " adamovic said .
" also they noticed that technological progress will not solve everything , as they thought before . "

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

supply shortages due to the sailors ' strike , some of the islands are already starting to suffer shortages in supplies such as medicine and fresh products .
" it ca n't go on like this , " said yannis diamantidis , a merchant shipping minister .
" there are even five dead bodies which ca n't be taken to their home islands in order to be buried . "

the sailors have demanded a 2-percent wage increase .
the ferry owners ' union of maritime enterprises -lrb- een -rrb- have said they would only agree to a 0.5 percent increase .
in a statement , they called for sailors to accept the terms in a " joint effort to save the sector . "
other sectors plan to strike greece 's main journalists ' union has called for a 24-hour news blackout on tuesday and public sector doctors have also vowed to walk off their jobs , in support of the striking sailors .

unions have called for a nationwide strike in greece on december 15 .

bremen struck for the third time in the 64th minute as said hsejinovic played a low ball in to almeida on the left hand side of the box .
almeida slotted the ball through kessler 's legs for his ninth goal of the season .
frayed tempers , red cards glory turned to shame 10 minutes from time for almeida as he elbowed st. pauli central defender carlos zambrano , only to be shown the red card .
" i was being fouled throughout the game and i lost it at that moment , " said almeida , who now faces a ban .
" that should not have happened and i would like to apologise to the team and the fans . "
st pauli were also reduced to 10 men in the last minute as markus thorandt was sent off for a robust tackle on torsten frings , and the final score was 3-0 .

milivoje novakovic scored for cologne in the 51st minute , taking advantage after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio was unable to keep a 35-metre free-kick from portuguese midfielder petit under control .
however , wolfsburg substitute cicero put the scores level spectacularly - four minutes after coming onto the pitch - with an overhead kick low into the corner in the 81st minute .
the draw sees cologne move up to 16th place in the table on 12 points , while wolfsburg remain 13th on 16 points .
" it was disappointing not to hold the lead , but it was definitely a step in the right direction , " said cologne coach frank schaefer .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a compromise , the copenhagen accord saw countries outline their climate protection strategies - but the last-minute document was non-binding and opposed by some developing nations . climate change is real at the opening of the talks , host and mexican president felipe calderon emphasized that the effects of climate change were already being felt , with the most severe hurricanes on record in mexico , flooding in pakistan and the record heat wave that caused forest fires in russia earlier this year .
" climate change is beginning to make us pay for the fatal errors we as humanity have committed against the environment , " he said .
" it 's crucial for the international community to prove that cancun can deliver progress , " eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said in brussels before departing for mexico .
" if not , i fear that some parties would lose patience in the un process , " she warned .
helping developing countries cope with the financial impacts of climate change remains a hot-button issue for negotiators .
international representatives see the two-week talks in cancun as a fresh start and hope concrete steps forward will chew away at the crisis of confidence facing the latest round of negotiations .
way of the mayans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the cancun talks were crucial environmental organizations are also putting more pressure on world governments to work through the deadlock .
the environmental group greenpeace floated a hot air balloon past the nearby mayan ruins of chichen itza , in a symbolic gesture aimed at reminding delegates of the collapse of earlier advanced civilizations . " for all their sophistication , the mayans did not see their destruction coming .
but we can see ours , " the group said in a press release .
development agency oxfam also warned of the risks of inaction at this year 's talks .
" the human impacts of climate change in 2010 send a powerful reminder why progress in cancun is more urgent than ever , " oxfam 's eu climate advisor tim gore said .
the issue of emissions cuts is also getting more targeted attention at the political level .
the european union has encouraged those countries with high greenhouse gas output to rein in emissions .
despite political opposition in congress , us president barack obama has said he will push toward his country 's pledge to slash emissions over the next decade .
the united states is the world 's second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , behind china . but china has not warmed to the prospect of binding emissions reduction targets - despite us calls that beijing commit to cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china emits the most greenhouse gases of any country worldwide national leadership meanwhile , climate experts have called on government leaders to help move the process forward .
stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute for climate impact research pointed to german chancellor angela merkel : " in a situation like this , i believe that what 's needed is strong leadership , especially from those who understand the problems and realize how urgent it is to act , and that this urgency increases with every passing year , " he told deutsche welle .
but merkel has been accused of weak leadership on the climate front by germany 's political opposition , with the green party 's co-leader renate kuenast saying merkel was " never a ' climate chancellor . " '
still , members of merkel 's own conservative christian democrats are holding out hope that the talks in cancun will yield concrete progress .
" anyone who insists it 's too late and nothing can be done needs to explain what the alternative is , " the cdu 's environmental spokesman andreas jung told deutsche welle .
" personally , i believe there is no alternative to negotiations held under un leadership – even if this is a slow process . "

the tie-up will create europe 's second-largest carrier . after more than two years of negotiations , the five billion euro -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- merger of british airways and iberia was given the green light by shareholders of both airlines on monday , creating europe 's second-biggest carrier after air france-klm .
the combined company will be called international airlines group , but both flag carriers will keep operating under their respective brand names , with dual hubs in london and madrid .
" we are very happy that the shareholders gave their approval to the merger of iberia and british airways , " iberia chairman antonio vazquez , who will also become chairman of the combined group , said in a statement .
" it is certainly to their advantage , since it will bring great value to the business of both airlines and will lead to major synergies , " he added .

ba chief executive willie walsh , who will become ceo of the combined company , said the merger would allow the british airline to compete effectively with low-cost carriers .
ba and iberia also have very few overlapping routes , meaning the two flag carriers complement each other .
iberia has the biggest share of the europe-latin america market and ba is the number-one airline on transatlantic flights and has strong europe-asia connections .
the merger is expected to yield cost savings of 400 million euros after the fifth year .
like many carriers , ba and iberia were faced with slackening demand and heavy losses due to the global credit crunch and started merger talks roughly two years ago .
in june , the tie-up was practically a done deal after ba agreed to a recovery plan for it enormous pension deficit , which had been a major sticking point in the negotiations .
the deal is expected to be finalized in january , when shares in the new , combined company start trading in london and madrid .
ba shareholders will have 56 percent in the new company , while investors in iberia will hold 44 percent .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .

the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

foreigners will now face deportation for serious crimes in switzerland . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

buying all of postbank , including the costs of acquiring its initial 30 percent stake , is expected to cost deutsche bank at least 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- .
the move allows the german financial giant to add 14 million retail clients to its existing base of about 10 million customers .
it will also add 1,100 branches to deutsche bank 's network , bringing the total number of branches to 2,900 in germany alone .
' balanced earnings mix ' " in the future , the deutsche bank group will have more stable revenues and a more balanced earnings mix , " josef ackermann , chairman of the bank 's management board , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is germany 's largest retail bank with 14 million clients currently , deutsche bank generates more than 80 percent of its profits from investment banking .
last month , the bank – germany 's biggest based on assets – completed its biggest-ever share sale to fund the acquisition and increase reserves ahead of tighter regulations on capital .
postbank will remain an independent brand , with customers experiencing no changes in their daily banking services , deutsche bank said .
the bank added that it will temporarily sell a small portion of postbank shares to bring its stake below 50 percent until us antitrust authorities approve the takeover .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .
exporting a non-citizen resident who is found guilty -lrb- discriminating again -rrb- of such felonies as listed in the article is certainly congruent with judicial acts intended to protect the country 's citizens . - dan , us compiled by stuart tiffen editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 29.11.2010 back to the socialist future at prague sci-fi exhibition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this comic was one of many sci-fi items from 1948-1978 an exhibition currently running in prague offers a rare chance to revisit science fiction from the communist era in czechoslovakia , when the genre promised a wholly bright – and red – future . " planet eden : the world of tomorrow in socialist czechoslovakia 1948 to 1978 " features magazines , books , films , posters , paintings and toys , offering a comprehensive overview of the science fiction produced in the country at that time .
in the 1950s in particular , the all-powerful communist party sought to impose its ideology on the population , pushing the promise that utopia was on its way .
such propaganda also infiltrated the burgeoning sci-fi genre , leading to bright visions of a post-capitalist world .
by the same token , exploring the concept of dystopia , of a nightmare future full of fear and devoid of personal freedom , was out of the question for czechoslovak writers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech sci-fi was full of utopian space imagery " that was quite different from the vision of the future in western sci-fi , where we can find many dark visions of the future , " said tomas pospiszyl , planet eden 's co-curator , in an interview with deutsche welle .
a soviet bloc-wide vision many authors took inspiration from other eastern bloc writers , including the great polish futurologist stanislav lem , and russia 's boris and arkady strugatsky , whose novel " roadside picnic " provided the basis for andrei tarkovsky 's classic movie stalker .
" unlike western science fiction , which was more plot-oriented , czech writers tended to be more oriented to ideas , and maybe moral issues , " added ivan adamovic , another curator at the show .
it was not until the 1960s that they devoted more attention to action and gripping plots , he noted .
pospiszyl also pointed out the emphasis on the positive posed particular difficulties in creating plot lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rockets and spaceships easily integrated into urban life " it was actually quite a problem for writers and artists of that time to even find dramatic situations , " he said .
" because the future was supposed to be optimistic and great .
they found a solution in ceding little pockets of capitalism that somehow travelled in time , or were rediscovered in the future . "
needless to say , the ussr had a strong influence on the sci-fi produced in one of its satellite states .
" especially in the 1950s , many czechoslovak illustrators were even afraid to develop their own images , " pospiszyl observed .
" quite often they were recycling or using elements that they could find in soviet magazines of that time .
we can see one type of spaceship used all over , and the original source is znanie sila -lsb- knowledge is power -rsb- magazine . "
eventually a relative easing of political repression , combined with the grim reality of life under communism , did lead to a reduction in the party-line optimism previously seen in czechoslovak sci-fi .
" it came in the second half of the 1960s , when people realised we would not reach communism within the 20th century , " adamovic said .
" also they noticed that technological progress will not solve everything , as they thought before . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the artwork predicted chess-playing robots , albeit not in the form that turned out czech cosmonaut marks end of show running on a video screen at planet eden is looped footage of the chubby and balding vladimir remek arriving back on earth after taking part in the russian soyuz 28 mission in 1978 , when he became the first , and only , czech cosmonaut .
the year of the spaceflight made by remek - who is today a communist mep - was chosen to bookend the exhibition for a reason , adamovic also pointed out .
" it was a tragic image , which did n't fit the previous , optimistic visions of how the heroes of space would look , " he said . " he was not anything like some kind of superhero in a spacesuit .
he lived so long in the soviet union that he almost forgot how to speak czech -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
people laughed when they heard him speaking , in fact . "
the exhibition runs at the dox gallery in prague until december 13 , 2010 .

buying all of postbank , including the costs of acquiring its initial 30 percent stake , is expected to cost deutsche bank at least 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- .
the move allows the german financial giant to add 14 million retail clients to its existing base of about 10 million customers .
it will also add 1,100 branches to deutsche bank 's network , bringing the total number of branches to 2,900 in germany alone .
' balanced earnings mix ' " in the future , the deutsche bank group will have more stable revenues and a more balanced earnings mix , " josef ackermann , chairman of the bank 's management board , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is germany 's largest retail bank with 14 million clients currently , deutsche bank generates more than 80 percent of its profits from investment banking .
last month , the bank – germany 's biggest based on assets – completed its biggest-ever share sale to fund the acquisition and increase reserves ahead of tighter regulations on capital .
postbank will remain an independent brand , with customers experiencing no changes in their daily banking services , deutsche bank said .
the bank added that it will temporarily sell a small portion of postbank shares to bring its stake below 50 percent until us antitrust authorities approve the takeover .

" the frankfurt stock exchange was one of the last bastions in floor-based trading in cash equities , " peck told deutsche welle . " what we are seeing is an exchange responding to client demand for electronic market places yet at the same time we still have politicians calling for stringent regulation of high-frequency trading . " germany led the way the rapid growth of electronic trading in global financial markets began in germany in january 1990 , when deutsche terminboerse -lrb- dtb -rrb- , the frankfurt-based derivatives exchange now rebranded as eurex , first introduced its electronic trading system . the dtb ’ s adoption of a screen-based , electronic trading platform enabled it to wrestle complete control of the lucrative bund contract for german government bonds from its arch-rival , the london international financial futures and options exchange -lrb- liffe -rrb- , by april 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt is home to germany 's biggest market for shares and bonds artur fischer , joint-ceo at boerse berlin equiduct trading , was an intimate observer of the early adoption of electronic trading and the dtb ’ s fierce struggle with liffe .

" it shows that if deutsche boerse intends to do something it is quite capable of actually achieving it . " ' flash crash ' in may this year , a highly publicized " flash crash " resulted in the dow jones industrial average plunging nearly 1,000 points in 20 minutes .
the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , a us financial regulator , has since piloted " circuit breakers " , which halt trading if prices move 10 percent or more within a rolling five-minute period . fischer of boerse berlin equiduct trading said the pan-european trading platform has " market breakers " in place , which check if traded market prices can be justified by market conditions . " if we had a situation like the flash crash , we would have intervened and stopped those trades because they were not reflecting market conditions , " he said . bob giffords , an independent banking and technology analyst based in the uk , said the ' flash crash ' on the dow showed that most algorithms were still not sufficiently developed to take a balanced view in " highly disruptive " market conditions . " they are calibrated for normal conditions but not for the extreme volatility of market crashes , which are pretty impossible to simulate anyway , " said giffords . " a human being can react to the full richness of what is happening whereas algorithms tend to be quite limited at what they look at , and so in chaotic moments may fall apart or rush into crowded trades .
in such circumstances a sensible trader should switch them off . " bildunterschrift : from may 2011 , all frankfurt trading will take place via the xetra system .
the implementation of the state-of-the-art platform marks another milestone in the growth of electronic trading regional exchanges ' polarized ' a senior official at a major regional exchange in germany said deutsche boerse ’ s decision to switch all trading to the xetra electronic platform would " polarize " the business of trading in germany by increasing trading costs at regional exchanges throughout the country .

this will force the exchanges to move much closer together to overcome the cost disadvantage , " the official , who did not wish to be named , told deutsche welle . germany has regional exchanges in bremen , berlin , dusseldorf , munich and stuttgart .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

buying all of postbank , including the costs of acquiring its initial 30 percent stake , is expected to cost deutsche bank at least 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- .

it will also add 1,100 branches to deutsche bank 's network , bringing the total number of branches to 2,900 in germany alone .
' balanced earnings mix ' " in the future , the deutsche bank group will have more stable revenues and a more balanced earnings mix , " josef ackermann , chairman of the bank 's management board , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is germany 's largest retail bank with 14 million clients currently , deutsche bank generates more than 80 percent of its profits from investment banking .
last month , the bank – germany 's biggest based on assets – completed its biggest-ever share sale to fund the acquisition and increase reserves ahead of tighter regulations on capital .
postbank will remain an independent brand , with customers experiencing no changes in their daily banking services , deutsche bank said .
the bank added that it will temporarily sell a small portion of postbank shares to bring its stake below 50 percent until us antitrust authorities approve the takeover .

china has staked claims to aksai chin in the ladakh region and arunachal pradesh , which beijing refers to as southern tibet . during this new round of talks , india is hoping that china will address the issuing of stapled visas by chinese officials for residents of jammu and kashmir on the ground that the territory is disputed , which as been a serious bone of contention between the two sides . however , china expert srikanth kondapali of the centre for east asian studies is not hopeful about the outcome of the talks and says there has been a change of course . " china in the 1980s and 90s suggested that the kashmir dispute was a bilateral dispute but that the two countries should resolve this dispute peacefully , and both countries should respect the line of control .
these positions appear to have been revised now with china 's active role in kashmir , physically and in terms of policy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are always smiles when the leaders of india and china meet but the border dispute rankles behind the scenes bringing new energy to a slow process although india and china launched discussions to resolve the border dispute in 1980 , progress has been slow .
the process received some impetus after the two countries agreed to hold talks by designated special representatives . ex-foreign secretary shivshankar menon is expected to bring new energy into the current efforts to resolve the complex boundary dispute as he shares a good bond with the top chinese leadership and has spent a considerable part of his diplomatic career in beijing .
he also speaks fluent mandarin . varaprasad shekhar from jawaharlal nehru university points out it will help neither side to have a confrontationist attitude .
" instead of looking at these issues from a very narrow perspective , we need to see the larger picture and try to see how we can resolve the situation .
i think india and china must walk on the path of peace . " a host of other issues including india 's concerns over china 's plans to build a dam over brahmaputra river and the reported presence of chinese personnel for various projects in pakistan-occupied kashmir were expected to figure in the two-day talks . fourth round of strategic dialogue the two countries also held the fourth round of strategic dialogue as part of a wider consultative process to prepare for the visit of premier wen .
" the strategic dialogue process was stalled for various reasons .
india and china have had three strategic dialogues so far .
it includes everything under the sky – bilateral relations , regional security issues and global aspects , " said kondapali . bildunterschrift : tawang monastery is in the north-eastern indian state of arunachal pradesh , which is also claimed by china the endorsement of india 's candidature for a permanent seat in the un security council by us president barrack obama during his recent visit means that china is now the only one of the five veto-wielding members of the united nations security council to not yet have taken a stand on the issue .

now the question is whether western nations step up their support for political reform or simply stand on the sidelines ? the parliamentary elections in egypt had shaped up to be as much an indication of us and european commitment to human rights and democracy as also a dress rehearsal for next year 's egyptian presidential election .
michele dunne , a middle east expert at the carnegie endowment for international peace , said people in egypt and other arab countries were watching the west closely to see to what extent they press for free and fair elections in the arab world 's most populous country .
" they will take that as a sign of whether the us and europe are serious about these issues or whether they have relegated them to the sidelines , " dunne told deutsche welle .
for much of the past year , the us and the european union have largely been quiet about the deterioration of human rights and prospects for real democracy in egypt .
these issues were glaringly absent from us secretary of state hillary clinton 's agenda when she met with egyptian foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit earlier this month in washington .
similarly , egyptian president hosni mubarak 's poor human rights and democracy record has not figured prominently in recent high-level contacts between the eu and egypt .
crackdown on opposition the western stance appears to have led mubarak , in power since 1981 , to conclude that he has a free hand in shaping the electoral process .
for weeks , police and supporters of the muslim brotherhood , the largest opposition movement , have been clashing .
the banned group controls a fifth of the seats in the present parliament by running candidates as independents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-katatni says the police crackdown threatens to turn the polls into a sham according to human rights watch , security forces have so far arrested over 1,300 muslim brotherhood members , including five candidates .
the government has also shut down several independent media organizations .
monitors ?
no , thank you the us had , however , called for free and fair elections . state department spokesman philip crowley appealed to egypt to allow peaceful political gatherings , open media coverage and admit international observers to the polls .
the foreign ministry in cairo countered in a statement that this constituted meddling in egypt 's internal affairs .
" the latest positions taken by the administration toward internal egyptian affairs is something that is absolutely unacceptable , " the foreign ministry said in the statement , quoting an unnamed official .
" it is as if the united states has turned into a caretaker of how egyptian society should conduct its own politics .
whoever thinks that this is possible is deluded . "
the statement said egypt would honor the tradition of mutual respect as long as the united states did the same .
the heated discussion over the egyptian political scene is nothing new and has been going on for some 20 years , said adel iskandar , a professor at georgetown university 's center for contemporary arab studies .
but it was crucial for the us and europe to foster debate about democracy and human rights .
" the regime has taken two steps forward and five steps back , " iskandar told deutsche welle .
" instead of focusing on how much progress has been made , the debate should revolve around how little progress has been achieved . "
weighing the pros and cons it is a fine line , though , considering the volatile , geo-strategic part of the world .
western governments fear that taking egypt to task for its dismal democracy and human rights record could prompt mubarak to withdraw support for the stumbling israeli-palestinian peace process .
egypt also supplies valuable logistics for allied military operations in afghanistan and iraq .
some analysts argue , however , that the long-term risks of the us and europe being perceived as perpetuating authoritarian rule in egypt and elsewhere in the arab world could prove costlier than the short-term benefits of turning a blind eye to flagrant violations of human rights and democratic deficiencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most egyptians think mubarak is grooming his 46-year-old son gamal to take over but edward walker , a former us ambassador to egypt , said changes were up to the egyptian people .
" it is not something that the us can or should dictate , but neither should we be quiet about what we believe in , " walker told deutsche welle .
" so i think it is appropriate for the administration to review what is going on . "
in addition , western powers may just have more leverage than they assume .
analysts said egypt had a vested interest in continued support of us policy in the greater middle east .
the arab nation would not backtrack on support for the israeli-palestinian peace process and risk us congressional favor for its substantial annual aid package .
the government in cairo uses much of the aid to strengthen its domestic security and ability to confront opposition groups .
putting that in jeopardy could spark unrest in the military concerned that it could lose its prerogatives at a time that egypt is gearing up for a battle over who will succeed the country 's octogenarian leader .
the government is also unlikely to risk its control of all us and european democracy and human rights assistance to egyptian non-governmental organizations .
it exercises that control through an agreement with donors that they will only fund ngos , which are officially recognized and authorized by the government .
pivotal presidential elections next year the parliamentary polls are of only moderate importance compared to the presidential elections scheduled for next year that could change egypt 's political landscape , many us and european officials believe .
speculation is rife about whether 82-year-old mubarak , who is in poor health , will run for a sixth six-year term or whether he will push his banker son gamal or his intelligence chief omar suleiman as his successor .
even if mubarak does opt for reelection , it is unlikely that he would be able to serve another full term .
proponents of a more assertive american and european stance said the time will then be ripe to address egypt 's human rights record and stifling of democratic development .
by publicly focusing on the issue , the us and the eu would shape debate in egypt prior to a changing of the guard along the nile , encourage democracy and human rights activists and alter widespread perception in egypt and the rest of the arab world that the united states favors authoritarian rule .

they write the unvarnished truth about politically highly explosive issues , relying on the confidential nature of their reports .
but now , the whole world is reading their comments !
readers can get an idea of the foundations of the superpower 's foreign policies , thanks to an internet journal that about 2 million people worldwide have access to - an incredible 800,000 people can read even the encrypted messages .
suddenly , highly explosive remarks are common knowledge and confidential diplomatic cables are exposed to the light of day , leaving the foreign policy of a world power wide open to ridicule .
a disaster for the united states . never before has the allies ' confidence in the superpower america been shaken as it has now . germany 's foreign minister is faced with an american diplomat 's assessment of himself as incompetent .
the development aid minister is regarded as an " odd choice . " even the federal chancellor must put up with being characterized as " not very creative . "
tiny diplomatic slaps in the face that gain weight by the international media 's bit-by-bit presentation to the general public .
some of the ridiculous recommendations by israel and several arab states on how the us should deal with iran are even more explosive .
the reader involuntarily holds his breath when reading how the us is urgently pressed to resort to military engagement .
a diplomatic waterloo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's daniel scheschkewitz the knee-jerk reactions these political analyses might have led to at the height of the cold war do n't bear contemplation .
the problem is not so much the fact that diplomats do what has always been their job : to give their government a blunt evaluation of the political situation and the politicians in their host country .
that is not objectionable .
what is scandalous is that in this digital day and age , even a technological superpower like the us has not been able to keep these evaluations secret .
this is international diplomacy 's waterloo .
the internet and social networks like twitter and facebook have obviously changed the rules of global communication .
in times when even nato is preparing for cyber war , diplomatic services ca n't pretend that outdated rules of concealment still prevail .
all the same , secrets today should still be able to remain secret .
international diplomacy can not function without discretion .
that is true for the trusting relationship among allies , who should not be snubbed in public .
but it is absolutely a " conditio sine qua non " concerning security issues .
even if the parameters of international communication can not be turned back , no one is absolved from the obligation of due diligence .
least of all the superpower that invented the internet .

"
during his long government career he also served o n the national security council and was a principal author of the carter doctrine for the persian gulf .
earlier , he worked as foreign policy adviser to the late senator edward kennedy and as foreign and domestic policy adviser to us vice president hubert humphrey .
hunter is currently a senior adviser at the rand corporation in washington , dc .
deutsche welle : you have served as us ambassador to nato .
were you in any way implicated by the release of these cables or were some cables you wrote included in the release ?
robert hunter : not as far as i can tell .
i think these are more recent and i have been out of government for 12 years .
i am sorry about that because i wrote some pretty good cables .
it would help me writing my memoirs if they would put them out in the public domain .
in the documents us diplomats describe germany 's foreign minister as vain , arrogant and critical of the us and chancellor merkel as risk-averse and rarely creative .
what is the fallout likely to be of these assessments of german , but also international leaders for us diplomatic relations ?
i think you would have to ask the individual leaders on that .
obviously it does n't help , but at the same time leaders would be more concerned about the compromising nature of this then about what they say .
i remember when i was in the carter white house and there was a german chancellor named schmidt who used to say all kinds of things about the us president .
that of course poisoned the relationship because he tended to broadcast it to everybody .
but i think these folks are basically grown-ups and they will shrug it off and maybe with a little bit of humor it will give them a little bit of license to say things about our people which of course they do in private all the time and sometimes in public .
what was the most stunning thing in these cables you did n't know before ?
i do n't think anything actually .
as far as i have been able to sift through things in the last few hours one thing is perhaps a little bit more strident commentary by some of the arab leaders in the persian gulf about iran , but again nothing that one really did n't know before .
i guess one has to say that the most important revelation is that there are no revelations here .
it shows among other things that the united states does not engage in conspiracies .
maybe we should , but we are very bad at it .
many of the countries featured in the cables such as pakistan or iraq and of course the us have criticized the release as irresponsible .
australia has said it would support us legal action against it .
one us congressman went even further demanding that wikileaks should be declared a foreign terrorist organization .
do you agree with that assessment ?
of course not .
i regret deeply that somebody , obviously some american , has chosen to hand these things over because it does complicate the capacity to have serious conversations with others and affects the integrity of the system .
for example , and here i think is the most serious problem , many foreign leaders will be more reluctant to say things to us diplomats if they worry that these things will show up in public .
and as a result the methodology of communication may have to adopt different ways and means in order to minimize the risks .
that 's the real problem that people will perhaps be less candid in the future and the way of communicating that back to washington will have to change .
while some of the cables provide some new insights , it appears that most of the assessments do n't reveal much news , i.e. that some arab countries are deeply worried about iran or that the us is concerned about the safety of pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or that corruption is a huge concern in afghanistan .
is the media hype around this release that was of course created by wikileaks , but also by the stern us opposition against it justified in your opinion ?
-lrb- laughing -rrb- yes , what a series of revelations .
i did n't know any of this .
but i think what this does do in a positive sense is it shows that the united states is genuinely trying to act as a leader and trying to protect its security and that of other countries .
in that sense i think people will look at it positively .
but the real concern as i said is that it makes it less likely that some leaders will be as candid with some us diplomats or will look for reassurances that the manner in which the classification is done will keep things more or less confidential .
but leaders one deals with tend to be grown-ups and very rarely do they say things that they would n't as we used to say want to see in the washington post .
should the us have tried to play this down a bit , instead of making this release a really big deal and thereby perhaps even increasing the hype around it ?
i think the government has to oppose it and has to make very clear that this kind of thing can cause potential damage .
the real issue is less in these cables than in some of the earlier revelations , particularly about places like iraq and afghanistan , where people the united states authorities have dealt with may have their lives put at risk by being identified to terrorists who will then target them .
whether that has actually happened , i have n't seen reports on it , but i also would n't expect to see reports on it .
and finally , you said that your cables probably would n't be included , but what was the juiciest cable that you wrote that should be included in this the leak ?
i wrote all kinds of strategy cables which had a lot to do with the restructuring of european security back in the 1990s and now for my memoirs i would have to go over to the state department and dig through the documents .
but if wikileaks had access to it , and i am sure it would n't because the time it covered , it would just simplify my task .
i am being a little light-hearted about that merely to say that most of that material as we have seen so far is not at all causing any revelations .
it may confirm some things people thought .
more to the point are the earlier releases that could actually put people 's lives at risk .
and so far i have n't seen any of these from the media reporting that seem to indicate that .

buying all of postbank , including the costs of acquiring its initial 30 percent stake , is expected to cost deutsche bank at least 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.4 billion -rrb- .
the move allows the german financial giant to add 14 million retail clients to its existing base of about 10 million customers .
it will also add 1,100 branches to deutsche bank 's network , bringing the total number of branches to 2,900 in germany alone .
' balanced earnings mix ' " in the future , the deutsche bank group will have more stable revenues and a more balanced earnings mix , " josef ackermann , chairman of the bank 's management board , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postbank is germany 's largest retail bank with 14 million clients currently , deutsche bank generates more than 80 percent of its profits from investment banking .
last month , the bank – germany 's biggest based on assets – completed its biggest-ever share sale to fund the acquisition and increase reserves ahead of tighter regulations on capital .
postbank will remain an independent brand , with customers experiencing no changes in their daily banking services , deutsche bank said .
the bank added that it will temporarily sell a small portion of postbank shares to bring its stake below 50 percent until us antitrust authorities approve the takeover .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

the tie-up will create europe 's second-largest carrier . after more than two years of negotiations , the five billion euro -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- merger of british airways and iberia was given the green light by shareholders of both airlines on monday , creating europe 's second-biggest carrier after air france-klm .
the combined company will be called international airlines group , but both flag carriers will keep operating under their respective brand names , with dual hubs in london and madrid .
" we are very happy that the shareholders gave their approval to the merger of iberia and british airways , " iberia chairman antonio vazquez , who will also become chairman of the combined group , said in a statement .
" it is certainly to their advantage , since it will bring great value to the business of both airlines and will lead to major synergies , " he added .
' compelling logic ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london heathrow will be one of the hubs of the combined group ba 's chairman martin broughton said the deal had a " compelling , strategic and financial logic " that would benefit staff , passengers and shareholders alike .
ba chief executive willie walsh , who will become ceo of the combined company , said the merger would allow the british airline to compete effectively with low-cost carriers .
ba and iberia also have very few overlapping routes , meaning the two flag carriers complement each other .
iberia has the biggest share of the europe-latin america market and ba is the number-one airline on transatlantic flights and has strong europe-asia connections .
the merger is expected to yield cost savings of 400 million euros after the fifth year .
like many carriers , ba and iberia were faced with slackening demand and heavy losses due to the global credit crunch and started merger talks roughly two years ago .
in june , the tie-up was practically a done deal after ba agreed to a recovery plan for it enormous pension deficit , which had been a major sticking point in the negotiations .
the deal is expected to be finalized in january , when shares in the new , combined company start trading in london and madrid .
ba shareholders will have 56 percent in the new company , while investors in iberia will hold 44 percent .

the pentagon has condemned the release as " reckless . " whistle-blower website wikileaks released over 250,000 diplomatic cables on sunday , providing frank opinions about foreign leaders and other sensitive information from the us state department .
the cables , most from the last three years , contain unflattering views regarding leading world figures .
in one document , german chancellor angela merkel is summed up as being " risk-averse " and " not very creative . "
" the americans argue that the chancellor views international diplomacy above all from the perspective of how she can profit from it domestically , " according to der spiegel , which , along with britain 's the guardian and the new york times had been given early access to the documents .
however , the reports show that us diplomats favor merkel over foreign minister guido westerwelle , who der spiegel claimed was seen as " aggressive , vain and short on substance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : ' avoids risk , rarely creative ' westerwelle , leader of merkel 's coalition partners the free democrats , was described by the americans as a " riddle " when he took on his foreign ministry role just over a year ago and was believed to maintain hostility to certain us interests .
' doubts have been raised ' meanwhile , the german goverment said on monday that the disclosed information had not harmed german-us relations .
government spokesman steffen seibert told reporters that berlin " regretted the publication " but that relations with washington remained " robust , close and in no way clouded by the affair . "
however , ruprecht polenz , the chairman of germany 's foreign committee , was of the opinion that " considerable damage " had been done .
" the partners of the united states are under the assumption that what is discussed with them remains confidential .
now , certainly , doubts have been raised .
our american partners will have to work to dispel these doubts , " polenz said on german public television on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : ' vain , aggressive , short on substance ' shedding light on sensitive topics the documents include sensitive and potentially destabilizing information , including the fact that king abdullah of saudi arabia allegedly urged the us to attack iran to destroy its nuclear program and that saudi donors remain the chief financiers of militant groups like al qaeda .
the saudi monarch is reported to have pressed washington to " cut the head off the snake " while there was still time .
the documents also include details of iranian missiles , obtained from north korea , which would be capable of hitting western europe .
further topics that the release sheds light upon include china 's alleged hacking of internet giant google , us fears about the smuggling of enriched uranium from pakistan 's nuclear program and american negotiations over the resettlement of guantanamo bay detainees .
details were also provided of talks between the us and south korea about the prospects for a unified korea if political and economic troubles caused the north to implode as a state .
pentagon condemns release as a ' reckless ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's administration is working to limit the damage the emergence of the documents has been criticized by the us administration , with efforts being made to limit the potential diplomatic damage .
" these cables could compromise private discussions with foreign governments and opposition leaders , and when the substance of private conversations is printed on the front pages of newspapers across the world , it can deeply impact not only us foreign policy interests , but those of our allies and friends around the world , " white house spokesman robert gibbs said in a statement .
the pentagon , which was infuriated by the release of secret logs from the afghanistan and iran conflicts earlier this year , condemned the release as a " reckless " dump of classified documents that endangered lives and was against the law .
in response , the pentagon said it had put into place measures to " prevent further compromise of sensitive data . "
according to the guardian , the diplomatic cables originate from a database run by the us military , which could be accessed by up to 3 million people .

swiss voters approve harsher deportation plan does the proposal to expel foreigners convicted of crimes discriminate unfairly ?
of course not .
laws are to be respected , people have to be responsible for their own actions and accept the outcome .
why should a county that accepts people with the best intentions , not act when those -lrb- best intentions -rrb- are disregarded ?
enough of the politically correct nonsense .
i believe the majority of people in any country want to live their lives respecting of others , especially foreigners .
it should be a privilege for anyone who immigrates to another country in search of a better life , not a right .
i am an immigrant to this great country and i did my best and continue to do my best to be part of it .
everyone should be required to assimilate ...
i did and it suits me well . - john , us a country has a right to be free from foreign criminals to protect its citizens .
i applaud switzerland 's stand to protect its citizens .
it is not discriminatory at all .
there are consequences for committing crimes and you should not have to pay for courts , jail housing and rehabilitation for people who do not respect your laws .
i only wish that the us would do more to protect its citizens by not harboring criminals and illegal immigrants .
the us government does not want to offend at the expense of citizens ' safety and has an ulterior motive in allowing illegals into this country , many of whom are criminals .
our jails are overrun and the taxpayers are tired of taking care of them . - kristine , us hooray for the swiss !
other european countries as well as the us should be adopting such laws .
it 's about time people wake up ! - steve , spain human rights groups have a problem with countries dealing with a serious criminal element in their society .
why ?
these criminals come into their country from another country and have no respect for the laws and customs of their newfound country .
we are not talking about minor criminal offenses but major crimes such as murder and rape .
do n't surrender your country like much of america has . - bill , us i agree with the swiss proposal .
the rationale behind the human rights criticism that this is unfair should be applied equally to the crimes the perpetrators committed against a civil population .
we have a worse situation having inherited the refugees from england and other commonwealth nations that flock to canada and can not behave as reasonable citizens .
they become a problem and the honest taxpayers have to pay for their comfort .
send them back to the uncomfortable place they came from as a result of their crimes in the country that gave them an honest opportunity . - sanford , canada i support the swiss deportation plan .
it 's just common sense .
if you do n't obey our laws and hurt other people , you ca n't stay in our land .
simple .
i 'd like to know what " human rights " group is opposed to this new plan ?
murder , rape or trafficking in drugs and people are crimes against human rights and no one should be protecting these criminals .
as for the poster of the black sheep .
oh please !
it has nothing to do with race .
have n't you heard of the phrase " the black sheep of the family ? "
it means the one in the family that is naughty and breaks the rules . - b. , us if a guest enters your home and violates your rules or insults your family , that guest loses all rights of hospitality .
so too , should non-citizens who violate the rules and laws of a state be subject to the same justice .
america needs to rethink its very liberal generosity to criminals just as the swiss do .
thank god someone in the world still has common sense ! - rowdy , us congratulations to the sensible swiss people .
criminals are always discriminated against ... their crimes invite discrimination .
it is plain silly to simply ignore the crime committed .
far too many people live in a dream world where ' discrimination ' is the only real crime ... this is total foolishness .
persons convicted of serious crimes like murder , rape , drug and people trafficking should be deported to their homelands after release from jail .
the crimes they have committed are extremely serious and cancel their residency in switzerland .
swiss voters must start leading the other european voters to return to sensible policies which promote high quality work and peaceful living .
groups and individuals who do not want this lifestyle should be sent back whence they came .
god bless switzerland and her sensible people . - michael , australia in this case discrimination , as applied to those who commit criminal actions , is intrinsic to judicial processes in civilized countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 29.11.2010 elections in egypt test western commitment to democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian voters were turned away from polling booths the polls in egypt have been marred by allegations of vote-rigging and fraud .
now the question is whether western nations step up their support for political reform or simply stand on the sidelines ? the parliamentary elections in egypt had shaped up to be as much an indication of us and european commitment to human rights and democracy as also a dress rehearsal for next year 's egyptian presidential election .
michele dunne , a middle east expert at the carnegie endowment for international peace , said people in egypt and other arab countries were watching the west closely to see to what extent they press for free and fair elections in the arab world 's most populous country .
" they will take that as a sign of whether the us and europe are serious about these issues or whether they have relegated them to the sidelines , " dunne told deutsche welle .
for much of the past year , the us and the european union have largely been quiet about the deterioration of human rights and prospects for real democracy in egypt .
these issues were glaringly absent from us secretary of state hillary clinton 's agenda when she met with egyptian foreign minister ahmed aboul gheit earlier this month in washington .
similarly , egyptian president hosni mubarak 's poor human rights and democracy record has not figured prominently in recent high-level contacts between the eu and egypt .
crackdown on opposition the western stance appears to have led mubarak , in power since 1981 , to conclude that he has a free hand in shaping the electoral process .
for weeks , police and supporters of the muslim brotherhood , the largest opposition movement , have been clashing .
the banned group controls a fifth of the seats in the present parliament by running candidates as independents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-katatni says the police crackdown threatens to turn the polls into a sham according to human rights watch , security forces have so far arrested over 1,300 muslim brotherhood members , including five candidates .
the government has also shut down several independent media organizations .
monitors ?
no , thank you the us had , however , called for free and fair elections . state department spokesman philip crowley appealed to egypt to allow peaceful political gatherings , open media coverage and admit international observers to the polls .
the foreign ministry in cairo countered in a statement that this constituted meddling in egypt 's internal affairs .
" the latest positions taken by the administration toward internal egyptian affairs is something that is absolutely unacceptable , " the foreign ministry said in the statement , quoting an unnamed official .
" it is as if the united states has turned into a caretaker of how egyptian society should conduct its own politics .
whoever thinks that this is possible is deluded . "
the statement said egypt would honor the tradition of mutual respect as long as the united states did the same .
the heated discussion over the egyptian political scene is nothing new and has been going on for some 20 years , said adel iskandar , a professor at georgetown university 's center for contemporary arab studies .
but it was crucial for the us and europe to foster debate about democracy and human rights .
" the regime has taken two steps forward and five steps back , " iskandar told deutsche welle .
" instead of focusing on how much progress has been made , the debate should revolve around how little progress has been achieved . "
weighing the pros and cons it is a fine line , though , considering the volatile , geo-strategic part of the world .
western governments fear that taking egypt to task for its dismal democracy and human rights record could prompt mubarak to withdraw support for the stumbling israeli-palestinian peace process .
egypt also supplies valuable logistics for allied military operations in afghanistan and iraq .
some analysts argue , however , that the long-term risks of the us and europe being perceived as perpetuating authoritarian rule in egypt and elsewhere in the arab world could prove costlier than the short-term benefits of turning a blind eye to flagrant violations of human rights and democratic deficiencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most egyptians think mubarak is grooming his 46-year-old son gamal to take over but edward walker , a former us ambassador to egypt , said changes were up to the egyptian people .
" it is not something that the us can or should dictate , but neither should we be quiet about what we believe in , " walker told deutsche welle .
" so i think it is appropriate for the administration to review what is going on . "
in addition , western powers may just have more leverage than they assume .
analysts said egypt had a vested interest in continued support of us policy in the greater middle east .
the arab nation would not backtrack on support for the israeli-palestinian peace process and risk us congressional favor for its substantial annual aid package .
the government in cairo uses much of the aid to strengthen its domestic security and ability to confront opposition groups .
putting that in jeopardy could spark unrest in the military concerned that it could lose its prerogatives at a time that egypt is gearing up for a battle over who will succeed the country 's octogenarian leader .
the government is also unlikely to risk its control of all us and european democracy and human rights assistance to egyptian non-governmental organizations .
it exercises that control through an agreement with donors that they will only fund ngos , which are officially recognized and authorized by the government .
pivotal presidential elections next year the parliamentary polls are of only moderate importance compared to the presidential elections scheduled for next year that could change egypt 's political landscape , many us and european officials believe .
speculation is rife about whether 82-year-old mubarak , who is in poor health , will run for a sixth six-year term or whether he will push his banker son gamal or his intelligence chief omar suleiman as his successor .
even if mubarak does opt for reelection , it is unlikely that he would be able to serve another full term .
proponents of a more assertive american and european stance said the time will then be ripe to address egypt 's human rights record and stifling of democratic development .
by publicly focusing on the issue , the us and the eu would shape debate in egypt prior to a changing of the guard along the nile , encourage democracy and human rights activists and alter widespread perception in egypt and the rest of the arab world that the united states favors authoritarian rule .
