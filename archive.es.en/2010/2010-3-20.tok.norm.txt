germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

attorney john kirkland said the company would enter the bidding with a publicly-traded american partner he declined to name .
the official announcement is scheduled for monday .
citing an unnamed source , news agency agence france presse reported that uac would propose a version of its ilyushin il-96 .
the aircraft would be built mainly in russia , and assembled at a factory in the southeast us .
" they have been working for more than a year to prepare this bid .
if the competition is fair , then uac would win , " kirkland said in a wall street journal report cited by reuters .
' no chance at all ' but teal group analyst richard aboulafia called the company 's entry attempt " bizarre . "
" they have no chance at all , " aboulafia told afp .
" in addition to the obvious security concerns , there are strong doubts about their ability to create a jetliner that 's up to airbus or boeing standards .
even if they did , the political obstacles would be insurmountable . "
on thursday the pentagon announced that it was considering extending a deadline to submit bids for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- project .
eads , the european aeronautic defense and space company , said friday that it might re-enter a bid , having dropped out earlier this month when its partnership with american firm northrop grumman collapsed .
eads , along with the british and french prime ministers , had also complained that the bid rules unfairly favored american competitor boeing. svs / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

but there 's more involved in many women 's struggle to combine their muslim identity with equal rights at home and work . it is n't easy being the first hijab-wearing woman to host a talk show in the netherlands .
esmaa alariachi , who started a popular tv talk show with her sisters called " the girls of halal , " said that at first her aim as a host was quite modest .
" my goal … was to just show people that muslims are also ordinary people : we eat , sleep , go to the cinema , have lunches , go to the theater , " she told deutsche welle .
about five percent of the dutch population is muslim , according to dutch government statistics .
still , alariachi says it took time for people to understand that muslim women could also be dutch feminists .
early on , she was often pigeonholed into speaking on certain topics .
" before , people who looked like me - wearing a headscarf - were only invited to address political and islamic issues .
they just put a stamp on your forehead , ' you are the expert on this , we only invite you for this , " ' said the 31 year old .
" now it is different , ” she added . traditional roles in her quest for professional success , alariachi had the support of her sisters .
but for many muslim women , the fight for equal treatment in the workplace is made harder by their families .
traditional communities often discourage even highly-educated women from working , says parvin ali , head of the fatima women 's network in the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible working conditions could help muslim mothers join the workforce " if the community from which that individual is coming … does n't actually support these decisions , it can be very , very difficult for the families to then support them , " says ali .
changing the workplace ali , who consults with governmental departments in the uk on gender and diversity issues , says more should be done to help muslim women integrate into the work place .
muslim women often want to remain the primary caregiver for their children , says ali , so employers should focus on more flexible working conditions .
" that means making sure there is flexibility when it comes to taking time for their care responsibilities , " she says , adding that a combination of working remotely and from home could benefit many working women , not just muslims .
as the debate over integration and women 's rights continues , it is clear there is still much work to be done .
but women like esmaa alariachi and her sisters are proof that it is possible to achieve a balance between being a woman , a muslim and a european .
" i faced many problems , but i made them into a challenge , and now people see us as celebrities in holland , " said alariachi .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

but there 's more involved in many women 's struggle to combine their muslim identity with equal rights at home and work . it is n't easy being the first hijab-wearing woman to host a talk show in the netherlands .
esmaa alariachi , who started a popular tv talk show with her sisters called " the girls of halal , " said that at first her aim as a host was quite modest .
" my goal … was to just show people that muslims are also ordinary people : we eat , sleep , go to the cinema , have lunches , go to the theater , " she told deutsche welle .
about five percent of the dutch population is muslim , according to dutch government statistics .
still , alariachi says it took time for people to understand that muslim women could also be dutch feminists .
early on , she was often pigeonholed into speaking on certain topics .
" before , people who looked like me - wearing a headscarf - were only invited to address political and islamic issues .
they just put a stamp on your forehead , ' you are the expert on this , we only invite you for this , " ' said the 31 year old .
" now it is different , ” she added . traditional roles in her quest for professional success , alariachi had the support of her sisters .
but for many muslim women , the fight for equal treatment in the workplace is made harder by their families .
traditional communities often discourage even highly-educated women from working , says parvin ali , head of the fatima women 's network in the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible working conditions could help muslim mothers join the workforce " if the community from which that individual is coming … does n't actually support these decisions , it can be very , very difficult for the families to then support them , " says ali .
changing the workplace ali , who consults with governmental departments in the uk on gender and diversity issues , says more should be done to help muslim women integrate into the work place .
muslim women often want to remain the primary caregiver for their children , says ali , so employers should focus on more flexible working conditions .
" that means making sure there is flexibility when it comes to taking time for their care responsibilities , " she says , adding that a combination of working remotely and from home could benefit many working women , not just muslims .
as the debate over integration and women 's rights continues , it is clear there is still much work to be done .
but women like esmaa alariachi and her sisters are proof that it is possible to achieve a balance between being a woman , a muslim and a european .
" i faced many problems , but i made them into a challenge , and now people see us as celebrities in holland , " said alariachi .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .

that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .

they 're in other museums today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.03.2010 racial inequality still rife across western world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting inter-racial understanding is easier said than done the un day for the elimination of racial discrimination has been on the global calendar for 35 years , but experts say there 's a long way to go before it becomes redundant .
not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

attorney john kirkland said the company would enter the bidding with a publicly-traded american partner he declined to name .
the official announcement is scheduled for monday .
citing an unnamed source , news agency agence france presse reported that uac would propose a version of its ilyushin il-96 .
the aircraft would be built mainly in russia , and assembled at a factory in the southeast us .
" they have been working for more than a year to prepare this bid .
if the competition is fair , then uac would win , " kirkland said in a wall street journal report cited by reuters .
' no chance at all ' but teal group analyst richard aboulafia called the company 's entry attempt " bizarre . "
" they have no chance at all , " aboulafia told afp .
" in addition to the obvious security concerns , there are strong doubts about their ability to create a jetliner that 's up to airbus or boeing standards .
even if they did , the political obstacles would be insurmountable . "
on thursday the pentagon announced that it was considering extending a deadline to submit bids for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- project .
eads , the european aeronautic defense and space company , said friday that it might re-enter a bid , having dropped out earlier this month when its partnership with american firm northrop grumman collapsed .
eads , along with the british and french prime ministers , had also complained that the bid rules unfairly favored american competitor boeing. svs / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .

sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .

" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .

changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .

" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .

" " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability .

" i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.03.2010 racial inequality still rife across western world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting inter-racial understanding is easier said than done the un day for the elimination of racial discrimination has been on the global calendar for 35 years , but experts say there 's a long way to go before it becomes redundant .
not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds .

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .
apart from that , you can combine anything you want . what it comes down to in the end is whether the result enchants you and stimulates you to take a closer look , and whether it helps you see things better . interview : anastassia boutsko -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland .

" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.03.2010 racial inequality still rife across western world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting inter-racial understanding is easier said than done the un day for the elimination of racial discrimination has been on the global calendar for 35 years , but experts say there 's a long way to go before it becomes redundant .
not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

attorney john kirkland said the company would enter the bidding with a publicly-traded american partner he declined to name .
the official announcement is scheduled for monday .
citing an unnamed source , news agency agence france presse reported that uac would propose a version of its ilyushin il-96 .
the aircraft would be built mainly in russia , and assembled at a factory in the southeast us .
" they have been working for more than a year to prepare this bid .
if the competition is fair , then uac would win , " kirkland said in a wall street journal report cited by reuters .
' no chance at all ' but teal group analyst richard aboulafia called the company 's entry attempt " bizarre . "
" they have no chance at all , " aboulafia told afp .
" in addition to the obvious security concerns , there are strong doubts about their ability to create a jetliner that 's up to airbus or boeing standards .
even if they did , the political obstacles would be insurmountable . "
on thursday the pentagon announced that it was considering extending a deadline to submit bids for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- project .
eads , the european aeronautic defense and space company , said friday that it might re-enter a bid , having dropped out earlier this month when its partnership with american firm northrop grumman collapsed .
eads , along with the british and french prime ministers , had also complained that the bid rules unfairly favored american competitor boeing. svs / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .
apart from that , you can combine anything you want . what it comes down to in the end is whether the result enchants you and stimulates you to take a closer look , and whether it helps you see things better . interview : anastassia boutsko -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

but there 's more involved in many women 's struggle to combine their muslim identity with equal rights at home and work . it is n't easy being the first hijab-wearing woman to host a talk show in the netherlands .
esmaa alariachi , who started a popular tv talk show with her sisters called " the girls of halal , " said that at first her aim as a host was quite modest .
" my goal … was to just show people that muslims are also ordinary people : we eat , sleep , go to the cinema , have lunches , go to the theater , " she told deutsche welle .
about five percent of the dutch population is muslim , according to dutch government statistics .
still , alariachi says it took time for people to understand that muslim women could also be dutch feminists .
early on , she was often pigeonholed into speaking on certain topics .
" before , people who looked like me - wearing a headscarf - were only invited to address political and islamic issues .
they just put a stamp on your forehead , ' you are the expert on this , we only invite you for this , " ' said the 31 year old .
" now it is different , ” she added . traditional roles in her quest for professional success , alariachi had the support of her sisters .
but for many muslim women , the fight for equal treatment in the workplace is made harder by their families .
traditional communities often discourage even highly-educated women from working , says parvin ali , head of the fatima women 's network in the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible working conditions could help muslim mothers join the workforce " if the community from which that individual is coming … does n't actually support these decisions , it can be very , very difficult for the families to then support them , " says ali .
changing the workplace ali , who consults with governmental departments in the uk on gender and diversity issues , says more should be done to help muslim women integrate into the work place .
muslim women often want to remain the primary caregiver for their children , says ali , so employers should focus on more flexible working conditions .
" that means making sure there is flexibility when it comes to taking time for their care responsibilities , " she says , adding that a combination of working remotely and from home could benefit many working women , not just muslims .
as the debate over integration and women 's rights continues , it is clear there is still much work to be done .
but women like esmaa alariachi and her sisters are proof that it is possible to achieve a balance between being a woman , a muslim and a european .
" i faced many problems , but i made them into a challenge , and now people see us as celebrities in holland , " said alariachi .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .
apart from that , you can combine anything you want . what it comes down to in the end is whether the result enchants you and stimulates you to take a closer look , and whether it helps you see things better . interview : anastassia boutsko -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.03.2010 racial inequality still rife across western world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting inter-racial understanding is easier said than done the un day for the elimination of racial discrimination has been on the global calendar for 35 years , but experts say there 's a long way to go before it becomes redundant .
not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

attorney john kirkland said the company would enter the bidding with a publicly-traded american partner he declined to name .
the official announcement is scheduled for monday .
citing an unnamed source , news agency agence france presse reported that uac would propose a version of its ilyushin il-96 .
the aircraft would be built mainly in russia , and assembled at a factory in the southeast us .
" they have been working for more than a year to prepare this bid .
if the competition is fair , then uac would win , " kirkland said in a wall street journal report cited by reuters .
' no chance at all ' but teal group analyst richard aboulafia called the company 's entry attempt " bizarre . "
" they have no chance at all , " aboulafia told afp .
" in addition to the obvious security concerns , there are strong doubts about their ability to create a jetliner that 's up to airbus or boeing standards .
even if they did , the political obstacles would be insurmountable . "
on thursday the pentagon announced that it was considering extending a deadline to submit bids for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- project .
eads , the european aeronautic defense and space company , said friday that it might re-enter a bid , having dropped out earlier this month when its partnership with american firm northrop grumman collapsed .
eads , along with the british and french prime ministers , had also complained that the bid rules unfairly favored american competitor boeing. svs / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 20.03.2010 europe 's muslim women move equality discussion beyond the veil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some traditional communities frown on working women much of the mainstream debate on muslim women in europe has centered on the headscarf .
but there 's more involved in many women 's struggle to combine their muslim identity with equal rights at home and work . it is n't easy being the first hijab-wearing woman to host a talk show in the netherlands .
esmaa alariachi , who started a popular tv talk show with her sisters called " the girls of halal , " said that at first her aim as a host was quite modest .
" my goal … was to just show people that muslims are also ordinary people : we eat , sleep , go to the cinema , have lunches , go to the theater , " she told deutsche welle .
about five percent of the dutch population is muslim , according to dutch government statistics .
still , alariachi says it took time for people to understand that muslim women could also be dutch feminists .
early on , she was often pigeonholed into speaking on certain topics .
" before , people who looked like me - wearing a headscarf - were only invited to address political and islamic issues .
they just put a stamp on your forehead , ' you are the expert on this , we only invite you for this , " ' said the 31 year old .
" now it is different , ” she added . traditional roles in her quest for professional success , alariachi had the support of her sisters .
but for many muslim women , the fight for equal treatment in the workplace is made harder by their families .
traditional communities often discourage even highly-educated women from working , says parvin ali , head of the fatima women 's network in the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible working conditions could help muslim mothers join the workforce " if the community from which that individual is coming … does n't actually support these decisions , it can be very , very difficult for the families to then support them , " says ali .
changing the workplace ali , who consults with governmental departments in the uk on gender and diversity issues , says more should be done to help muslim women integrate into the work place .
muslim women often want to remain the primary caregiver for their children , says ali , so employers should focus on more flexible working conditions .
" that means making sure there is flexibility when it comes to taking time for their care responsibilities , " she says , adding that a combination of working remotely and from home could benefit many working women , not just muslims .
as the debate over integration and women 's rights continues , it is clear there is still much work to be done .
but women like esmaa alariachi and her sisters are proof that it is possible to achieve a balance between being a woman , a muslim and a european .
" i faced many problems , but i made them into a challenge , and now people see us as celebrities in holland , " said alariachi .

but there 's more involved in many women 's struggle to combine their muslim identity with equal rights at home and work . it is n't easy being the first hijab-wearing woman to host a talk show in the netherlands .
esmaa alariachi , who started a popular tv talk show with her sisters called " the girls of halal , " said that at first her aim as a host was quite modest .
" my goal … was to just show people that muslims are also ordinary people : we eat , sleep , go to the cinema , have lunches , go to the theater , " she told deutsche welle .
about five percent of the dutch population is muslim , according to dutch government statistics .
still , alariachi says it took time for people to understand that muslim women could also be dutch feminists .

muslim women often want to remain the primary caregiver for their children , says ali , so employers should focus on more flexible working conditions .
" that means making sure there is flexibility when it comes to taking time for their care responsibilities , " she says , adding that a combination of working remotely and from home could benefit many working women , not just muslims .
as the debate over integration and women 's rights continues , it is clear there is still much work to be done .

but there 's more involved in many women 's struggle to combine their muslim identity with equal rights at home and work . it is n't easy being the first hijab-wearing woman to host a talk show in the netherlands .
esmaa alariachi , who started a popular tv talk show with her sisters called " the girls of halal , " said that at first her aim as a host was quite modest .
" my goal … was to just show people that muslims are also ordinary people : we eat , sleep , go to the cinema , have lunches , go to the theater , " she told deutsche welle .
about five percent of the dutch population is muslim , according to dutch government statistics .
still , alariachi says it took time for people to understand that muslim women could also be dutch feminists .
early on , she was often pigeonholed into speaking on certain topics .
" before , people who looked like me - wearing a headscarf - were only invited to address political and islamic issues .
they just put a stamp on your forehead , ' you are the expert on this , we only invite you for this , " ' said the 31 year old .
" now it is different , ” she added . traditional roles in her quest for professional success , alariachi had the support of her sisters .
but for many muslim women , the fight for equal treatment in the workplace is made harder by their families .
traditional communities often discourage even highly-educated women from working , says parvin ali , head of the fatima women 's network in the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible working conditions could help muslim mothers join the workforce " if the community from which that individual is coming … does n't actually support these decisions , it can be very , very difficult for the families to then support them , " says ali .
changing the workplace ali , who consults with governmental departments in the uk on gender and diversity issues , says more should be done to help muslim women integrate into the work place .
muslim women often want to remain the primary caregiver for their children , says ali , so employers should focus on more flexible working conditions .
" that means making sure there is flexibility when it comes to taking time for their care responsibilities , " she says , adding that a combination of working remotely and from home could benefit many working women , not just muslims .
as the debate over integration and women 's rights continues , it is clear there is still much work to be done .
but women like esmaa alariachi and her sisters are proof that it is possible to achieve a balance between being a woman , a muslim and a european .
" i faced many problems , but i made them into a challenge , and now people see us as celebrities in holland , " said alariachi .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .
apart from that , you can combine anything you want . what it comes down to in the end is whether the result enchants you and stimulates you to take a closer look , and whether it helps you see things better . interview : anastassia boutsko -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there 's more involved in many women 's struggle to combine their muslim identity with equal rights at home and work . it is n't easy being the first hijab-wearing woman to host a talk show in the netherlands .
esmaa alariachi , who started a popular tv talk show with her sisters called " the girls of halal , " said that at first her aim as a host was quite modest .
" my goal … was to just show people that muslims are also ordinary people : we eat , sleep , go to the cinema , have lunches , go to the theater , " she told deutsche welle .
about five percent of the dutch population is muslim , according to dutch government statistics .
still , alariachi says it took time for people to understand that muslim women could also be dutch feminists .
early on , she was often pigeonholed into speaking on certain topics .
" before , people who looked like me - wearing a headscarf - were only invited to address political and islamic issues .
they just put a stamp on your forehead , ' you are the expert on this , we only invite you for this , " ' said the 31 year old .
" now it is different , ” she added . traditional roles in her quest for professional success , alariachi had the support of her sisters .
but for many muslim women , the fight for equal treatment in the workplace is made harder by their families .
traditional communities often discourage even highly-educated women from working , says parvin ali , head of the fatima women 's network in the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible working conditions could help muslim mothers join the workforce " if the community from which that individual is coming … does n't actually support these decisions , it can be very , very difficult for the families to then support them , " says ali .
changing the workplace ali , who consults with governmental departments in the uk on gender and diversity issues , says more should be done to help muslim women integrate into the work place .
muslim women often want to remain the primary caregiver for their children , says ali , so employers should focus on more flexible working conditions .
" that means making sure there is flexibility when it comes to taking time for their care responsibilities , " she says , adding that a combination of working remotely and from home could benefit many working women , not just muslims .
as the debate over integration and women 's rights continues , it is clear there is still much work to be done .
but women like esmaa alariachi and her sisters are proof that it is possible to achieve a balance between being a woman , a muslim and a european .
" i faced many problems , but i made them into a challenge , and now people see us as celebrities in holland , " said alariachi .

these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .
apart from that , you can combine anything you want . what it comes down to in the end is whether the result enchants you and stimulates you to take a closer look , and whether it helps you see things better . interview : anastassia boutsko -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.03.2010 racial inequality still rife across western world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting inter-racial understanding is easier said than done the un day for the elimination of racial discrimination has been on the global calendar for 35 years , but experts say there 's a long way to go before it becomes redundant .
not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

" you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.03.2010 racial inequality still rife across western world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting inter-racial understanding is easier said than done the un day for the elimination of racial discrimination has been on the global calendar for 35 years , but experts say there 's a long way to go before it becomes redundant .
not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .

but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .

but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .
apart from that , you can combine anything you want . what it comes down to in the end is whether the result enchants you and stimulates you to take a closer look , and whether it helps you see things better . interview : anastassia boutsko -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

" you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

" we can not protract the situation any longer , " said barroso .
he announced that the commission was prepared to propose an emergency plan for greece on the basis of " coordinated bilateral loans . "

however , the greek problem is likely to dominate the summit unless euro-zone states find a solution quickly . german opposition germany opposes an eu bailout for debt-stricken greece , but has said it may be open to the possibility of an intervention by the imf . " the government has not excluded imf aid , " said german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm .
" each country can decide on its own whether to request imf aid . " the netherlands , italy , and finland have also said they are open to some degree of imf aid .

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .
" an african american male has more chance of ending up in prison than at college . "
obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

obama the savior ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can obama teach his people tolerance ?
so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

attorney john kirkland said the company would enter the bidding with a publicly-traded american partner he declined to name .
the official announcement is scheduled for monday .
citing an unnamed source , news agency agence france presse reported that uac would propose a version of its ilyushin il-96 .
the aircraft would be built mainly in russia , and assembled at a factory in the southeast us .
" they have been working for more than a year to prepare this bid .
if the competition is fair , then uac would win , " kirkland said in a wall street journal report cited by reuters .
' no chance at all ' but teal group analyst richard aboulafia called the company 's entry attempt " bizarre . "
" they have no chance at all , " aboulafia told afp .
" in addition to the obvious security concerns , there are strong doubts about their ability to create a jetliner that 's up to airbus or boeing standards .
even if they did , the political obstacles would be insurmountable . "
on thursday the pentagon announced that it was considering extending a deadline to submit bids for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- project .
eads , the european aeronautic defense and space company , said friday that it might re-enter a bid , having dropped out earlier this month when its partnership with american firm northrop grumman collapsed .
eads , along with the british and french prime ministers , had also complained that the bid rules unfairly favored american competitor boeing. svs / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.03.2010 racial inequality still rife across western world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting inter-racial understanding is easier said than done the un day for the elimination of racial discrimination has been on the global calendar for 35 years , but experts say there 's a long way to go before it becomes redundant .
not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .
" there has been an attempt to scapegoat the economic crisis on the back of immigrant workers who make up a large part of the workforce , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief efforts for hurricane katrina victims were dubbed racist people have lost the standard of living they had become accustomed to and this hardship has led to an increase in reactionary groups that whip up anti-immigrant feelings .
but while hackwell acknowledges this trend as a very real problem , he says xenophobic attitudes are as much about events in the past as anxiety over the future .
even though civil rights were finally won in the states in 1964 , the victory was the result of a struggle and not sudden public enlightenment .
and that struggle , hackwell says , is still going on today .
he cites lynchings and unfounded detentions in the south and explosive unemployment and incarceration rates for african americans as proof of the racial inequality that still rumbles and rages inside the belly of the world 's largest democratic power .
" the us likes to talk about democracy , but nothing could be further from the truth if you are a person of colour , " he said .

so has obama done anything to change that ?
" nothing , " says hackwell .
" just because we now have an african-american president , which in and of itself was a tremendous feat , that is only one person and that does n't change the very basic direction of the system and the system is very racist .
the us is a very racist country . "
but looking in to america from the other side of the water , obama 's election is seen as a definite step forward and something for european societies to aspire .
because as it stands there 's not a one among them which is anywhere near offering the job of head of state or government to a member of an ethnic minority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 20.03.2010 racial inequality still rife across western world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promoting inter-racial understanding is easier said than done the un day for the elimination of racial discrimination has been on the global calendar for 35 years , but experts say there 's a long way to go before it becomes redundant .
not least due to a rise in islamophobia . when the twin towers came crashing to the ground on september 11th 2001 , little could have prepared muslim communities across the western world for the fallout that was to land in their laps .
in the immediate aftermath there was a rapid increase in attacks against members of muslim communities , a rise in vandalism of mosques and a general sense of marginalisation .
and many muslims would say that feeling of having been pushed away from mainstream society has never gone away .
a study on discrimination against muslims conducted by the fundamental rights agency last year revealed that one in three participants had been at the receiving end of discriminatory behavior in the previous 12 months .
it is such statistics which have ushered the term islamophobia into the english language , but for all its usage , there is some disagreement about what it actually means , whether it refers to anti-religious or anti-racial sentiment .
are muslims being discriminated against on race grounds ?
sarah isal , deputy director of the runnymede trust racial equality think tank says yes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : race or religion , what comes first ?
" islamophobia in the way we mean it is about the very real discrimination faced by a particular group because of the perception of belonging to a particular religion , " she said .
" so in that sense it is used as a proxy for racism . "
moreover , she told deutsche welle , that although islamic groups are now facing heightened levels of discrimination , they have been the target of racial prejudice for a long time .
changing identity what is new however , is that while once upon a time muslims in the west might have referred to themselves as asian , and viewed themselves as part of a wider ethnic minority group , they now describe themselves as muslim .
and in keeping with that pattern of identification , there have been great efforts in recent years to make the muslim community easily accessible to those outside it .
but islamophobia expert dr. chris allen told deutsche welle that such initiatives are not necessarily the best way to promote tolerance .
" people have said if we increase understanding about islam then people will become more aware and the prejudice will disappear , " he said .
" but i think that is a naïve approach . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of mosques across europe have held open days allen believes that non-mosque-goers do n't need to know about friday prayers , but should understand acceptance as a social phenomenon and learn that discrimination and anti-muslim sentiment do not have a place in the modern world .
" let 's talk about the problem and not about islam as the problem , " he said .
" to address islamophobia , we do n't need to talk on an inter-faith basis , but we need to get muslims to be seen as ' normal ' . "
to do that he says it is crucial to look at areas of common ground among all ethnic and religious groups and for both muslims and non-muslims alike to stop apportioning and accepting unrealistic blame .
" if someone commits a terrorist attack , let 's not apologize because they might have some commonality with someone else elsewhere . "
what 's ' normal ' anyway ?
but pushing the notion of ' normal ' and making people open their eyes to what they do n't want to see is never going to be easy , not in europe and not across the atlantic .
bill hackwell , an organiser with the us anti-racism a.n.s.w.e.r. coalition told deutsche welle that racial discrimination is alive and kicking throughout america , and that the situation has been going from bad to worse , exacerbated by the global recession .

but there 's more involved in many women 's struggle to combine their muslim identity with equal rights at home and work . it is n't easy being the first hijab-wearing woman to host a talk show in the netherlands .
esmaa alariachi , who started a popular tv talk show with her sisters called " the girls of halal , " said that at first her aim as a host was quite modest .
" my goal … was to just show people that muslims are also ordinary people : we eat , sleep , go to the cinema , have lunches , go to the theater , " she told deutsche welle .
about five percent of the dutch population is muslim , according to dutch government statistics .
still , alariachi says it took time for people to understand that muslim women could also be dutch feminists .
early on , she was often pigeonholed into speaking on certain topics .
" before , people who looked like me - wearing a headscarf - were only invited to address political and islamic issues .
they just put a stamp on your forehead , ' you are the expert on this , we only invite you for this , " ' said the 31 year old .
" now it is different , ” she added . traditional roles in her quest for professional success , alariachi had the support of her sisters .
but for many muslim women , the fight for equal treatment in the workplace is made harder by their families .
traditional communities often discourage even highly-educated women from working , says parvin ali , head of the fatima women 's network in the uk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible working conditions could help muslim mothers join the workforce " if the community from which that individual is coming … does n't actually support these decisions , it can be very , very difficult for the families to then support them , " says ali .
changing the workplace ali , who consults with governmental departments in the uk on gender and diversity issues , says more should be done to help muslim women integrate into the work place .
muslim women often want to remain the primary caregiver for their children , says ali , so employers should focus on more flexible working conditions .
" that means making sure there is flexibility when it comes to taking time for their care responsibilities , " she says , adding that a combination of working remotely and from home could benefit many working women , not just muslims .
as the debate over integration and women 's rights continues , it is clear there is still much work to be done .
but women like esmaa alariachi and her sisters are proof that it is possible to achieve a balance between being a woman , a muslim and a european .
" i faced many problems , but i made them into a challenge , and now people see us as celebrities in holland , " said alariachi .

germany 's top archbishop said the letter was also relevant to the crisis in his church . the head of germany 's roman catholic church said on saturday that pope benedict 's apology to victims of sexual abuse was also a warning to his country 's church . " the scandal of sexual abuse is not just an irish problem .
it 's a church scandal in many places and it is a church scandal in germany , " said archbishop robert zollitsch in a statement after the release of the pope 's letter covering sexual abuse of minors by clergy in ireland . " that 's why i understand the pope 's admonition to the bishops in ireland as an admonition to us at the same time , " he said .
" i 'm grateful for these words . " the letter to irish catholics , read aloud by cardinal sean brady on saturday , apologized to victims of sexual abuse by clergy and called for decisive action .
however , it made no reference to the situation in germany . in recent weeks , more than 250 former students have come forward with allegations of abuse by priests across germany , with some cases dating back to the 1950s .
several allegations have also emerged in the pope 's former archdiocese in bavaria . victims say letter ' falls short ' the pope 's response came as countries across europe struggle to deal with sexual abuse allegations concerning priests and other religious workers , numbering in the hundreds . " you have suffered grievously and i am truly sorry , " the pope wrote in his letter , which was signed friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , left , met german archbishop robert zollitsch last week to discuss abuse cases in germany addressing irish bishops , he told them " you and your predecessors failed , at times grievously , to apply the long-established norms of canon law for the crime of child abuse . " he also chastised those religious workers who had abused children , saying they " must answer " for their crimes " before properly constituted tribunals . " " openly acknowledge your guilt , submit yourselves to the demands of justice , but do not despair of god 's mercy , " the pope wrote . an advocacy group for the irish victims said it was disappointed that the letter seemed to focus only on the role of lower-ranked priests without recognizing the vatican 's culpability . " we feel the letter falls far short of addressing the concerns of the victims , " maeve lewis , executive director of one in four , told reuters . zollitsch apologizes zollitsch gave his own apology on saturday for incidents of sexual abuse by a priest in the freiburg diocese . in an anonymous letter published in several german newspapers , a self-described abuse victim alleged that zollitsch covered up sexual abuse in the black forest community of oberharmersbach in the 1980s and 1990s . " i apologize to the victims in the name of the diocese and ask for forgiveness , " said the archbishop in a statement on the diocese 's web site .
zollitsch was in charge of human resources and staffing for the diocese at the time . the church has rejected the charge , but in his apology zollitsch wrote that as archbishop , he would act " more forcefully and be more insistent in -lsb- his -rsb- search for witnesses and victims .

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .
apart from that , you can combine anything you want . what it comes down to in the end is whether the result enchants you and stimulates you to take a closer look , and whether it helps you see things better . interview : anastassia boutsko -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with museum director hartwig fischer . while visiting essen in 1932 , paul j. sachs , a co-founder of the museum of modern art in new york , was so struck by museum folkwang that he dubbed it the " most beautiful museum " in the world . at the time , it displayed works by artists like henri matisse , vassily kandinsky , ernst ludwig kirchner , franz marc and others .
these modern masterpieces were shown side by side with objects from china and japan , greece and egypt , java and oceania . starting in 1937 , the nazis confiscated more than 1,400 works which were later sold and dispersed into public and private collections around the world .
for the first time in over seven decades , the majority of the original folkwang collection is together in one location and can be viewed from march 20 - july 25 , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with hartwig fischer , the director of the museum folkwang . the exhibition , entitled " the most beautiful museum in the world , " is the first special show in the newly reopened building , whose renovation was overseen by london-based architect david chipperfield . essen and the surrounding ruhr valley are one of three 2010 european capitals of culture . deutsche welle : the exhibition only lasts for about four months .
does it make you sad to think about it ending ? hartwig fischer : working on this exhibition means working with a historical fact .
namely that germany mutilated itself culturally under the nazis and damaged so many significant collections , so much art , and so many artists .
but these things have stayed alive , they can be seen .
they 're in other museums today .
so , i do n't think i 'll be sad .
rather , i 'm happy that we were able to bring these works here for four months .
it 's a great privilege . of course , with every beautiful work , you can picture having it in your own museum .
but what 's more important is that these pieces still exist and play a role in our lives . bildunterschrift : this 1930 photograph shows part of the folkwang collection , with a fountain by georg minnes brunnen and paintings by oskar schlemmer how difficult was it to obtain the works for this exhibition ? most of the works are part of public collections , not private ones .
we received a lot of support from our partner institutions , because everyone understood that this is a special exhibition that can only be done once - and can only be done here . in the end , we got nearly everything we wanted , with very few exceptions .
some pieces are n't there - not because the owners did n't want to lend them , but simply because they could n't be lent , due to restoration or organizational reasons . which important works from before 1933 could not be obtained ? there is a self-portrait of ernst ludwig kirchner which was painted on a tablecloth .
it 's so fragile that it can not travel anymore .
there 's a painting by henri matisse that is now part of another exhibition , which had been planned much further in advance .
but with the pieces we were able to obtain , the brilliance of museum folkwang prior to 1933 has been resurrected . one of your focuses with this exhibition was the history of the collection .
what else are you striving for ? this exhibition is not a reconstruction of the original collection .
we do n't show the works exactly as they were displayed in 1932 .
rather , we 're showing them according to today 's criteria .
we designed an exhibition plan that allows us to give each of the sections and each of the cultures its own room . but these rooms are connected so that visitors can see from one to the next and there is a permanent exchange without misunderstanding that these cultures indeed have their own area and own world .
that 's what we can show in this new exhibition with the museum 's new architecture - how a universal approach can be given a fresh angle . bildunterschrift : the renovated museum , designed by david chipperfield -lrb- pictured -rrb- , reopened in late january today , no one would display a gauguin or van gogh next to a traditional african mask .
but why not ? you can place works next to other that do n't necessarily have much to do with each other , but where the perception of one enhances a person 's perception of the other .
that 's a very mysterious process . in this exhibition , we have both .
we 've placed the pieces very close together , but we do n't suggest that they necessarily have something to do with each other .
i think it 's important to maintain this differentiation so that you do n't do anything that ca n't be justified historically .
apart from that , you can combine anything you want . what it comes down to in the end is whether the result enchants you and stimulates you to take a closer look , and whether it helps you see things better . interview : anastassia boutsko -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
