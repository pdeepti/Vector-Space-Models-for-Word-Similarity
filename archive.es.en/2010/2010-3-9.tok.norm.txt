program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .
he is not implicated in any of the abuse allegations. svs / kna / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

what experiences or expectations do you have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : ahmed farouk el w. · country : egypt first of all , i do n't like to work with my boss is a woman .
my performance will be better if my boss is a man .
my experience is : woman management is aggressive because she try to prove herself and she are very fast to apply punishment .
in man case , he drive the firm more wisely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : rahul d. · country : india yes definitely .
i would have worked even much better if my boss were a woman .
this is because here in india , the society is male-dominated .
so it is obvious that they are responsible for their household works and have to manage it by their own .
so women who are working professionals have to manage both their household work as well as job .
that is to say that they are good at management .
so it 's obvious that if a person has been trained by a woman boss would definitely be good at what he does .
the output is always received corresponding to the input .
so ...
i hope it 's justified ... is n't it ? ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : mogire m. · country : kenya well there is nothing i love like having a woman boss .
they are rather understanding lovely and create a lovely atmosphere in the office .

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

in man case , he drive the firm more wisely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : rahul d. · country : india yes definitely .
i would have worked even much better if my boss were a woman .
this is because here in india , the society is male-dominated .
so it is obvious that they are responsible for their household works and have to manage it by their own .
so women who are working professionals have to manage both their household work as well as job .
that is to say that they are good at management .

i hope it 's justified ... is n't it ? ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : mogire m. · country : kenya well there is nothing i love like having a woman boss .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .
he is not implicated in any of the abuse allegations. svs / kna / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .

merkel and juncker discussed the proposed plan to set up a european monetary fund similar to the international monetary fund , intended to help countries deeply in debt get back on track .
merkel stressed , however , that a series of sanctions would first have to considered , to prevent countries from building up their debts in the first place .
she hinted at possible penalties , including the temporary removal of a country 's voting rights in the european council .
both merkel and juncker cautioned that such a fund was not intended for greece .
" this is a plan for the future , " said merkel .
curb trading of credit default swaps also on tuesday , germany and france announced plans to set out proposals to curb or ban financial market speculation , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy will write a joint letter to european commission president jose manuel barroso outlining their proposals .
these include plans to regulate speculation against falling company share prices or loan losses and guards against speculating against the threatened bankruptcies of entire countries , including the trading of credit default swaps .
luxembourg and greece also lent their support for the latter initiative .
" we all agree that we need to prevent financial speculation , " said merkel .
" we believe that the persistent speculation against the euro zone countries gives cause to quickly implement these proposals , " she added , referring to the recent financial troubles of greece. cmk / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .

" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said .

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .
they have also voiced their concern that the country ’ s over 2,000 political prisoners , who include nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , will not be able to take part in the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has been under house arrest for over 14 of the past 20 years will national league for democracy participate ? the last elections in myanmar were held in 1990 .
they were won by suu kyi 's opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- but the junta never recognized the results . so far , the nld has not confirmed whether it will take part in this year 's polls .
as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .
the election laws include one on registering political parties , which will give some indication on how long the campaign period could last and effectively give a time frame for the polls . until now the junta has insisted the elections will take place this year . author : disha uppal editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "
the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .

the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .
" the conclusion is clear : this is not about the best tanker and also not about a fair competition . "
possible no-bid contract the us defense department said it was disappointed by the eads-northrop decision , but it denied accusations of unfairness .
the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's thomas enders was critical of the pentagon eads and northrop were offering a larger model based on the airbus a330 , which they claimed had greater capability , lower risk and better value despite its size .
fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .
the decision to drop out of the competition was a setback for eads ' plans to expand into the enormous us defense market , where its current presence is relatively small. smh / acb / dpa / ap / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .

fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .
the decision to drop out of the competition was a setback for eads ' plans to expand into the enormous us defense market , where its current presence is relatively small. smh / acb / dpa / ap / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .

they were won by suu kyi 's opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- but the junta never recognized the results . so far , the nld has not confirmed whether it will take part in this year 's polls .
as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .
the election laws include one on registering political parties , which will give some indication on how long the campaign period could last and effectively give a time frame for the polls . until now the junta has insisted the elections will take place this year . author : disha uppal editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .

merkel and juncker discussed the proposed plan to set up a european monetary fund similar to the international monetary fund , intended to help countries deeply in debt get back on track .
merkel stressed , however , that a series of sanctions would first have to considered , to prevent countries from building up their debts in the first place .
she hinted at possible penalties , including the temporary removal of a country 's voting rights in the european council .
both merkel and juncker cautioned that such a fund was not intended for greece .
" this is a plan for the future , " said merkel .
curb trading of credit default swaps also on tuesday , germany and france announced plans to set out proposals to curb or ban financial market speculation , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy will write a joint letter to european commission president jose manuel barroso outlining their proposals .
these include plans to regulate speculation against falling company share prices or loan losses and guards against speculating against the threatened bankruptcies of entire countries , including the trading of credit default swaps .
luxembourg and greece also lent their support for the latter initiative .
" we all agree that we need to prevent financial speculation , " said merkel .
" we believe that the persistent speculation against the euro zone countries gives cause to quickly implement these proposals , " she added , referring to the recent financial troubles of greece. cmk / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.03.2010 latvia eases immigration restrictions in bid for cash infusion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia regained its independence in 1991 latvia is desperate to attract new investors that could help the recovery of the country ’ s weak economy .
but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

cypriot authorities say they found the stolen body after an anonymous tip-off that steered the police to a cemetery outside of the capital of cyprus , nicosia .
the body has been formerly identified by papadopoulos ' family members .
" we have received the dna test results and the body is that of the late president , " police spokesman michalis katsounodos told reuters .
papadopoulos died in december 2008 of lung cancer and was buried in a cemetery in deftera , a village southwest of nicosia .
the theft of his body was discovered one day before the first anniversary of his death in 2009 .
the disappearance of papadopoulos ' body caused national outrage on the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officers searched the area near papadopoulos ' grave there has been no claim of responsibility for the theft and the motives were unclear .
at the time police said the robbery was " deliberate and carefully planned , " with the perpetrators taking precautions to cover their tracks .
despite suspicions the robbery was financially motivated , papadopoulos ' family members have said no ransom was ever received .
papadopoulos served as president from 2003 until march 2008 .
he lost a bid for a second term in office in 2008 after being defeated by demetris christofias , a former coalition partner .
he was a popular figure with greek cypriots after leading them in rejecting a un plan to reunite the divided island .
turkish cypriots voted in a simultaneous referendum to back the plan , but it failed and the greek sector later joined the eu. cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .

helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .
they have also voiced their concern that the country ’ s over 2,000 political prisoners , who include nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , will not be able to take part in the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has been under house arrest for over 14 of the past 20 years will national league for democracy participate ? the last elections in myanmar were held in 1990 .
they were won by suu kyi 's opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- but the junta never recognized the results . so far , the nld has not confirmed whether it will take part in this year 's polls .
as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .
the election laws include one on registering political parties , which will give some indication on how long the campaign period could last and effectively give a time frame for the polls . until now the junta has insisted the elections will take place this year . author : disha uppal editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel and juncker discussed the proposed plan to set up a european monetary fund similar to the international monetary fund , intended to help countries deeply in debt get back on track .
merkel stressed , however , that a series of sanctions would first have to considered , to prevent countries from building up their debts in the first place .
she hinted at possible penalties , including the temporary removal of a country 's voting rights in the european council .
both merkel and juncker cautioned that such a fund was not intended for greece .
" this is a plan for the future , " said merkel .
curb trading of credit default swaps also on tuesday , germany and france announced plans to set out proposals to curb or ban financial market speculation , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy will write a joint letter to european commission president jose manuel barroso outlining their proposals .
these include plans to regulate speculation against falling company share prices or loan losses and guards against speculating against the threatened bankruptcies of entire countries , including the trading of credit default swaps .
luxembourg and greece also lent their support for the latter initiative .
" we all agree that we need to prevent financial speculation , " said merkel .
" we believe that the persistent speculation against the euro zone countries gives cause to quickly implement these proposals , " she added , referring to the recent financial troubles of greece. cmk / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "

the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 09.03.2010 myanmar unveils new election laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. gen. than shwe , the leader of myanmar 's junta the military junta of myanmar , which is also known as burma , unveiled the first details of new election laws on tuesday . according to the state-run newspapers , the regime enacted five laws on monday to pave the way for the polls that are planned for later this year .
however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .
they have also voiced their concern that the country ’ s over 2,000 political prisoners , who include nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , will not be able to take part in the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has been under house arrest for over 14 of the past 20 years will national league for democracy participate ? the last elections in myanmar were held in 1990 .
they were won by suu kyi 's opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- but the junta never recognized the results . so far , the nld has not confirmed whether it will take part in this year 's polls .
as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .
the election laws include one on registering political parties , which will give some indication on how long the campaign period could last and effectively give a time frame for the polls . until now the junta has insisted the elections will take place this year . author : disha uppal editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 09.03.2010 germany has love-hate relationship to daring pop art guru mel ramos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel ramos turns 75 this year some say mel ramos revolutionized art in the 1960s by melding it with advertising .
a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de housing -pipe- 09.03.2010 silence reigns in ireland 's new suburbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen to 17 percent of ireland 's housing is unoccupied since its building boom ended , ireland has become a land of unoccupied and half-finished houses .
now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .

it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de psychology -pipe- 09.03.2010 sports psychologists make slow inroads into german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : failure before millions of viewers is par for the course in pro athletics professional athletes are under enormous pressure , and for some players the burden can be too much .
in soccer , more than other sports , the taboo on seeking help is a hard one to break .
could change be underway ? ' professional soccer player ' might sound like a dream job : lots of money , adoring fans , and you do n't have to wear a tie to work .
but in reality , the pressure on those chosen few athletes can be unbearably high .
imagine thousands of people watching your every move while you work , screaming - often cursing - at you for even small mistakes .
on top of that , there is a constant threat that illness or injury could end your career in the blink of an eye .
for a long time , dealing with this stress was a job for soccer players to manage alone .
but in recent years , that has begun to change .
since 2006 , the clinical sports psychologist aneta szpigiel has worked with a union that represents german pro soccer players , the vdv .
her office is in a sports-medicine and physical therapy clinic next to the schalke soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen - conveniently located so that players can come to her for help with their problems .
soccer is resistant " we mostly deal with crises that are tied to injuries , to the players ' fears of losing their place on the team , or with returning to play after they were out , " szpigiel said .
" we deal with fears related to their career outlook , with their future in soccer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gestures of frustration can be read in the stands szpigiel 's job is not unusual ; the field of sports psychology has been growing steadily over the past decades , and the business of keeping athletes mentally fit is booming .
what sets her apart , however , is that she works in the field of soccer - a sport that has tended to focus on hard physical workouts and mental toughness over discussing feelings and emotional strength .
jeannine ohlert is a sports psychologist , lecturer and researchers at the prestigious german sport university in cologne ; she agrees that professional soccer is among the most resistant sports when it comes to using team psychologists .
part of the problem is a misunderstanding about what kinds of help sport psychologists can offer , ohlert said .
athletes need to know that the main aim of sports psychologists is " not to solve problems , but to prevent them . "
" the aim of a sport psychologist is that the athletes are able to give their best performance when they need it .
not just in training but in competition , " ohlert said .
popular among team sports team sports are increasingly turning to have sports psychology to improve performance ; both field hockey and ice hockey teams in the germany have had therapists on their staff , ohlert noted .
" but in soccer , it ’ s still not accepted , " she asserted .
bildunterschrift : sometimes it is hard to keep your cool while playing sports the reason is at least partly historical , ohlert speculates .
" i think a lot of -lrb- managers -rrb- are people who played in the clubs themselves when they were younger .
and they say , ' i managed without a sport psychologist .
so the players today will be able to manage by themselves if they are strong enough . '
that 's difficult , " she said .
but vdv 's aneta szpigiel says the job is in fact " a lot like clinical psychology . "
she talks with her clients about the thoughts and emotions ; what 's more , she prescribes exercises for players trying to deal with blockages or injuries .
the aim is to help them regain confidence in a certain series of movements .
" soccer -lrb- here -rrb- is the most popular sport .
there is incredible pressure attached to it , and a lot of money .
the planning starts very early in life : will i be a pro soccer player , or not ?
that is enormous pressure , " she said .
reaction after robert enke 's death playing pro soccer under pressure is anything but new .
wolfgang overath , a star player in the 1970s for fc köln , had trouble dealing with the high expectations put on him by himself and others , even in his day .
" i played in the world cup in mexico 1970 .
and then günter netzer played the european championship in 1972 .
he was in great form and mine was getting worse and worse at club level , and then the public said : now netzer should play , " overath recounted .
" i kept getting worse because i had less and less self-confidence .
that is something that can happen when the pressure gets higher . "
back in the 1970s , however , access to professional help for players was much less readily available .
today , though , the sports professionals are busy people .
szpigiel noted that , especially after the suicide death of german national team goalie robert enke in november , 2009 , many professionals had a sudden need to talk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athletes often perform better in practice than in competition still , szpigiel says she wishes that in the future , psychological help for athletes could be even more commonplace .
" i believe that sports psychologists should become even more widely accepted than they are today , " szpigiel said .
" it is taken for granted that every sports team has a team of physical therapists on hand .

in soccer , more than other sports , the taboo on seeking help is a hard one to break .
could change be underway ? ' professional soccer player ' might sound like a dream job : lots of money , adoring fans , and you do n't have to wear a tie to work .
but in reality , the pressure on those chosen few athletes can be unbearably high .
imagine thousands of people watching your every move while you work , screaming - often cursing - at you for even small mistakes .
on top of that , there is a constant threat that illness or injury could end your career in the blink of an eye .
for a long time , dealing with this stress was a job for soccer players to manage alone .
but in recent years , that has begun to change .
since 2006 , the clinical sports psychologist aneta szpigiel has worked with a union that represents german pro soccer players , the vdv .
her office is in a sports-medicine and physical therapy clinic next to the schalke soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen - conveniently located so that players can come to her for help with their problems .
soccer is resistant " we mostly deal with crises that are tied to injuries , to the players ' fears of losing their place on the team , or with returning to play after they were out , " szpigiel said .
" we deal with fears related to their career outlook , with their future in soccer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gestures of frustration can be read in the stands szpigiel 's job is not unusual ; the field of sports psychology has been growing steadily over the past decades , and the business of keeping athletes mentally fit is booming .
what sets her apart , however , is that she works in the field of soccer - a sport that has tended to focus on hard physical workouts and mental toughness over discussing feelings and emotional strength .
jeannine ohlert is a sports psychologist , lecturer and researchers at the prestigious german sport university in cologne ; she agrees that professional soccer is among the most resistant sports when it comes to using team psychologists .
part of the problem is a misunderstanding about what kinds of help sport psychologists can offer , ohlert said .
athletes need to know that the main aim of sports psychologists is " not to solve problems , but to prevent them . "
" the aim of a sport psychologist is that the athletes are able to give their best performance when they need it .
not just in training but in competition , " ohlert said .
popular among team sports team sports are increasingly turning to have sports psychology to improve performance ; both field hockey and ice hockey teams in the germany have had therapists on their staff , ohlert noted .
" but in soccer , it ’ s still not accepted , " she asserted .
bildunterschrift : sometimes it is hard to keep your cool while playing sports the reason is at least partly historical , ohlert speculates .
" i think a lot of -lrb- managers -rrb- are people who played in the clubs themselves when they were younger .
and they say , ' i managed without a sport psychologist .
so the players today will be able to manage by themselves if they are strong enough . '
that 's difficult , " she said .
but vdv 's aneta szpigiel says the job is in fact " a lot like clinical psychology . "
she talks with her clients about the thoughts and emotions ; what 's more , she prescribes exercises for players trying to deal with blockages or injuries .
the aim is to help them regain confidence in a certain series of movements .
" soccer -lrb- here -rrb- is the most popular sport .
there is incredible pressure attached to it , and a lot of money .
the planning starts very early in life : will i be a pro soccer player , or not ?
that is enormous pressure , " she said .
reaction after robert enke 's death playing pro soccer under pressure is anything but new .
wolfgang overath , a star player in the 1970s for fc köln , had trouble dealing with the high expectations put on him by himself and others , even in his day .
" i played in the world cup in mexico 1970 .
and then günter netzer played the european championship in 1972 .
he was in great form and mine was getting worse and worse at club level , and then the public said : now netzer should play , " overath recounted .
" i kept getting worse because i had less and less self-confidence .
that is something that can happen when the pressure gets higher . "
back in the 1970s , however , access to professional help for players was much less readily available .
today , though , the sports professionals are busy people .
szpigiel noted that , especially after the suicide death of german national team goalie robert enke in november , 2009 , many professionals had a sudden need to talk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athletes often perform better in practice than in competition still , szpigiel says she wishes that in the future , psychological help for athletes could be even more commonplace .
" i believe that sports psychologists should become even more widely accepted than they are today , " szpigiel said .
" it is taken for granted that every sports team has a team of physical therapists on hand .
but the same should go for sports psychologists . "
not surprisingly , the sports university 's jeannine ohlert agrees .

her office is in a sports-medicine and physical therapy clinic next to the schalke soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen - conveniently located so that players can come to her for help with their problems .
soccer is resistant " we mostly deal with crises that are tied to injuries , to the players ' fears of losing their place on the team , or with returning to play after they were out , " szpigiel said .
" we deal with fears related to their career outlook , with their future in soccer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gestures of frustration can be read in the stands szpigiel 's job is not unusual ; the field of sports psychology has been growing steadily over the past decades , and the business of keeping athletes mentally fit is booming .
what sets her apart , however , is that she works in the field of soccer - a sport that has tended to focus on hard physical workouts and mental toughness over discussing feelings and emotional strength .
jeannine ohlert is a sports psychologist , lecturer and researchers at the prestigious german sport university in cologne ; she agrees that professional soccer is among the most resistant sports when it comes to using team psychologists .
part of the problem is a misunderstanding about what kinds of help sport psychologists can offer , ohlert said .
athletes need to know that the main aim of sports psychologists is " not to solve problems , but to prevent them . "
" the aim of a sport psychologist is that the athletes are able to give their best performance when they need it .
not just in training but in competition , " ohlert said .
popular among team sports team sports are increasingly turning to have sports psychology to improve performance ; both field hockey and ice hockey teams in the germany have had therapists on their staff , ohlert noted .
" but in soccer , it ’ s still not accepted , " she asserted .
bildunterschrift : sometimes it is hard to keep your cool while playing sports the reason is at least partly historical , ohlert speculates .
" i think a lot of -lrb- managers -rrb- are people who played in the clubs themselves when they were younger .
and they say , ' i managed without a sport psychologist .
so the players today will be able to manage by themselves if they are strong enough . '
that 's difficult , " she said .
but vdv 's aneta szpigiel says the job is in fact " a lot like clinical psychology . "
she talks with her clients about the thoughts and emotions ; what 's more , she prescribes exercises for players trying to deal with blockages or injuries .
the aim is to help them regain confidence in a certain series of movements .
" soccer -lrb- here -rrb- is the most popular sport .
there is incredible pressure attached to it , and a lot of money .
the planning starts very early in life : will i be a pro soccer player , or not ?
that is enormous pressure , " she said .
reaction after robert enke 's death playing pro soccer under pressure is anything but new .
wolfgang overath , a star player in the 1970s for fc köln , had trouble dealing with the high expectations put on him by himself and others , even in his day .
" i played in the world cup in mexico 1970 .
and then günter netzer played the european championship in 1972 .
he was in great form and mine was getting worse and worse at club level , and then the public said : now netzer should play , " overath recounted .
" i kept getting worse because i had less and less self-confidence .
that is something that can happen when the pressure gets higher . "
back in the 1970s , however , access to professional help for players was much less readily available .
today , though , the sports professionals are busy people .
szpigiel noted that , especially after the suicide death of german national team goalie robert enke in november , 2009 , many professionals had a sudden need to talk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athletes often perform better in practice than in competition still , szpigiel says she wishes that in the future , psychological help for athletes could be even more commonplace .
" i believe that sports psychologists should become even more widely accepted than they are today , " szpigiel said .
" it is taken for granted that every sports team has a team of physical therapists on hand .
but the same should go for sports psychologists . "
not surprisingly , the sports university 's jeannine ohlert agrees .
she notes that some other countries have a different attitude to germany , and cites the example of in seville , spain , which has 11 sports psychologists on staff . she believes that shows " they care about their players ' whole development as a person , and not just as a soccer player . "
room for improvement if soccer teams had a staff of psychologists , they could work on " communication , cohesion , structures ... so many things , " ohlert said , with the ultimate goal being to strengthen players to stand up to the pressures of pro athletics .
meanwhile , ohlert points out that more german clubs - she gives hoffenheim as an example - are starting to turn to sport psychologists .
" it getting better , " she said .
" but we still have a long way to go . "

it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 09.03.2010 germany debates extending the statute of limitations for sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the reported abuse cases happened too long ago as more and more allegations of sexual abuse in catholic institutions come to light , german politicians debate whether to extend the statute of limitations for civil and criminal prosecution . a rash of reported cases of sexual abuse and molestation in schools and other institutions run by the catholic church in germany has led to a discussion about whether the country 's time limit on civil and criminal prosecution of abuse cases should be raised .
most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

the heat and power plant in neubrandenburg , for example , channels hot water with a temperature between 55 and 80 degrees celsius from a depth of around 1,300 meters to the surface . the water passes on its heat via a heat exchanger to a district heating network and then flows back underground through another shaft .
with the help of heat pumps and geothermal collectors , some houses are heated entirely with this natural method . for generating electricity with steam turbines , temperatures of at least 150 degrees celsius are needed .
in germany , these temperatures can only be found at a depth of 2,500 to 4,500 meters , which is why the country only has a few small geothermal power plants . in order to test geothermal electricity production methods , experts from the gfz german research centre for geosciences in potsdam are performing drillings up to 4,300 meters deep in a geothermal lab in brandenburg . this kind of energy production is much easier in regions with volcanic activity , such as iceland , italy and kenya .
for example , kenya 's olkaria geothermal power plants are located in the great rift valley - a long fracture zone running from lebanon to mozambique . here , water vapor at a temperature of 300 to 350 degrees celsius is channeled to the surface from a depth of around 2,000 meters via several shafts to turn the steam turbines and produce electricity .
the potential for this kind of power generation is huge , but only a fraction of it is being currently exploited . author : antonia roetger -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .

99 percent of our planet is hotter than 1000 degrees celsius .
this natural heat can be harnessed for eco-friendly electricity production .
what is more , poor countries can profit from it . the ancient romans knew how to live the good life .
they turned hot springs with sulfurous water into thermal baths , creating health spas for the rich and powerful .
this knowledge of the earth 's heat was passed on to their descendants : modern-day italians who set up the first geothermal power plant italy in 1913 , paving the way for a new form of energy production . today , geothermal energy is used in numerous countries .
it works especially well in places where volcanic activity is high and the crust of the earth is thin .
drilled tunnels several kilometers long release steam with a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius -lrb- 392 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is then easily turned into electricity at special power plants around the world from new zealand to the philippines to the west coast of the united states . clean energy worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first geothermal plant was set up in italy a warm climate is not a prerequisite for geothermal energy .
sweden , for example , with its cool temperatures , is a world leader in heating buildings with heat pumps .
this near-surface geothermal energy , as it is known , involves drilling shafts up to 400 meters deep , and inserting pipe-shaped heat exchanging devices to channel the heat to the surface . experts believe that geothermal energy could satisfy the world 's energy needs in the long term - and this could be done in an eco-friendly way .
according to stefan dietrich from germany 's geothermal energy association -lrb- gtv -rrb- , " geothermal energy is one hundred percent clean to produce . " this is the reason why this kind of energy is publicly financed in many european countries - an important factor , considering that deeper drilling is necessary to reach the required temperatures there . iceland : heated streets " without public subsidies , geothermal energy is not cost-effective in central europe , " said horst kreuter from the ngo international geothermal association -lrb- iga -rrb- .
however , he is confident that this situation is not permanent and that geothermal energy will be profitable in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hell 's gate national park in kenya is home to an important geothermal plant iceland is a prime example of the implementation and cost-effectiveness of geothermal energy .
over half of the country 's energy needs are covered with this method .
even one fifth of the electricity supply stems from geothermal power plants .
geothermal power is so affordable there that even some streets in the capital city , reykjavik , are heated in winter . indonesia : hope for affordable electrcity just like iceland , indonesia is a volcanic region .
the country has very good geological conditions for using geothermal energy in electricity production .
despite this , less than half of indonesians have access to electricity , and for those who do , power outages are a common occurrence .
it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .
but these regions also frequently have the perfect conditions for the utilization of geothermal energy . kenya , which straddles the great rift valley , is a prime example of this .
the country is largely dependent on hydro power , but due to ongoing drought , alternative sources of energy are being sought .
geothermal energy is one possibility .
at the moment , kenya has eight geothermal power plants , including the olkaria power plant in the hell 's gate national park north-west of nairobi . many opportunities , few risks " geothermal energy makes a lot of sense in developing countries that have no nationwide electricity network , " said stefan dietrich .
" geothermal energy 's big advantage compared to ordinary energy sources like nuclear and coal-fired plants is its decentralized organization . " however , despite all the opportunities and eco-friendliness it offers , geothermal energy is not completely risk-free .
there are fears that drilling in geographically delicate regions could trigger earthquakes . " when humans are active underground , there are risks , " said horst kreuter .
" but with geothermal energy , they are very low . " author : nele jensch -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .
" the conclusion is clear : this is not about the best tanker and also not about a fair competition . "
possible no-bid contract the us defense department said it was disappointed by the eads-northrop decision , but it denied accusations of unfairness .
the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's thomas enders was critical of the pentagon eads and northrop were offering a larger model based on the airbus a330 , which they claimed had greater capability , lower risk and better value despite its size .
fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "
the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .
the eu 's 27 member states agreed to limit deficits to 3 percent in their so-called stability and growth pact .
tough decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes shut down public offices across portugal in early march details of the austerity measures included cuts in military spending by 40 percent by 2013 and two-year delays to the planned lisbon-porto and porto-vigo high-speed rail links .
the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .
the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .
the opposition social democratic party declined to comment on the specifics of the plan , but said it would welcome " adjustments made in line with proposals from other parties . "
austerity measures in portugal follow similar cuts in cash-strapped greece , where fears of a credit default have devalued greek bonds and the euro 's worth against foreign currencies. acb / afp / ap / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de housing -pipe- 09.03.2010 silence reigns in ireland 's new suburbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen to 17 percent of ireland 's housing is unoccupied since its building boom ended , ireland has become a land of unoccupied and half-finished houses .
now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

99 percent of our planet is hotter than 1000 degrees celsius .
this natural heat can be harnessed for eco-friendly electricity production .
what is more , poor countries can profit from it . the ancient romans knew how to live the good life .
they turned hot springs with sulfurous water into thermal baths , creating health spas for the rich and powerful .

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "
the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .
the eu 's 27 member states agreed to limit deficits to 3 percent in their so-called stability and growth pact .
tough decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes shut down public offices across portugal in early march details of the austerity measures included cuts in military spending by 40 percent by 2013 and two-year delays to the planned lisbon-porto and porto-vigo high-speed rail links .
the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .
the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.03.2010 migrant workers risk deportation from thailand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the thai authorities were criticized for deporting illegal immigrants by ship with very little food and water bangkok said on monday it would jail migrant workers caught at mass anti-government protests planned for this weekend .
there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .

" probably they get involved in other business projects .

soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "

" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .

those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .
they have also voiced their concern that the country ’ s over 2,000 political prisoners , who include nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , will not be able to take part in the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has been under house arrest for over 14 of the past 20 years will national league for democracy participate ? the last elections in myanmar were held in 1990 .
they were won by suu kyi 's opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- but the junta never recognized the results . so far , the nld has not confirmed whether it will take part in this year 's polls .
as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .
the election laws include one on registering political parties , which will give some indication on how long the campaign period could last and effectively give a time frame for the polls . until now the junta has insisted the elections will take place this year . author : disha uppal editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

in germany , these temperatures can only be found at a depth of 2,500 to 4,500 meters , which is why the country only has a few small geothermal power plants . in order to test geothermal electricity production methods , experts from the gfz german research centre for geosciences in potsdam are performing drillings up to 4,300 meters deep in a geothermal lab in brandenburg . this kind of energy production is much easier in regions with volcanic activity , such as iceland , italy and kenya .
for example , kenya 's olkaria geothermal power plants are located in the great rift valley - a long fracture zone running from lebanon to mozambique . here , water vapor at a temperature of 300 to 350 degrees celsius is channeled to the surface from a depth of around 2,000 meters via several shafts to turn the steam turbines and produce electricity .

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures .

merkel and juncker discussed the proposed plan to set up a european monetary fund similar to the international monetary fund , intended to help countries deeply in debt get back on track .
merkel stressed , however , that a series of sanctions would first have to considered , to prevent countries from building up their debts in the first place .
she hinted at possible penalties , including the temporary removal of a country 's voting rights in the european council .
both merkel and juncker cautioned that such a fund was not intended for greece .
" this is a plan for the future , " said merkel .
curb trading of credit default swaps also on tuesday , germany and france announced plans to set out proposals to curb or ban financial market speculation , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy will write a joint letter to european commission president jose manuel barroso outlining their proposals .
these include plans to regulate speculation against falling company share prices or loan losses and guards against speculating against the threatened bankruptcies of entire countries , including the trading of credit default swaps .
luxembourg and greece also lent their support for the latter initiative .
" we all agree that we need to prevent financial speculation , " said merkel .

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .

as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .

this warmth can be used for heating , cooling and electricity production . at a depth of 25 meters -lrb- 82 feet -rrb- below the earth 's surface the temperature remains constant , regardless of the weather or location .
for every 100 meters further down , it increases by 3 to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . in germany , utilizing the earth 's natural warmth for heating is quite widespread .
the heat and power plant in neubrandenburg , for example , channels hot water with a temperature between 55 and 80 degrees celsius from a depth of around 1,300 meters to the surface . the water passes on its heat via a heat exchanger to a district heating network and then flows back underground through another shaft .
with the help of heat pumps and geothermal collectors , some houses are heated entirely with this natural method . for generating electricity with steam turbines , temperatures of at least 150 degrees celsius are needed .
in germany , these temperatures can only be found at a depth of 2,500 to 4,500 meters , which is why the country only has a few small geothermal power plants . in order to test geothermal electricity production methods , experts from the gfz german research centre for geosciences in potsdam are performing drillings up to 4,300 meters deep in a geothermal lab in brandenburg . this kind of energy production is much easier in regions with volcanic activity , such as iceland , italy and kenya .
for example , kenya 's olkaria geothermal power plants are located in the great rift valley - a long fracture zone running from lebanon to mozambique . here , water vapor at a temperature of 300 to 350 degrees celsius is channeled to the surface from a depth of around 2,000 meters via several shafts to turn the steam turbines and produce electricity .
the potential for this kind of power generation is huge , but only a fraction of it is being currently exploited . author : antonia roetger -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de housing -pipe- 09.03.2010 silence reigns in ireland 's new suburbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen to 17 percent of ireland 's housing is unoccupied since its building boom ended , ireland has become a land of unoccupied and half-finished houses .
now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 09.03.2010 germany has love-hate relationship to daring pop art guru mel ramos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel ramos turns 75 this year some say mel ramos revolutionized art in the 1960s by melding it with advertising .
a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .

this natural heat can be harnessed for eco-friendly electricity production .
what is more , poor countries can profit from it . the ancient romans knew how to live the good life .
they turned hot springs with sulfurous water into thermal baths , creating health spas for the rich and powerful .
this knowledge of the earth 's heat was passed on to their descendants : modern-day italians who set up the first geothermal power plant italy in 1913 , paving the way for a new form of energy production . today , geothermal energy is used in numerous countries .
it works especially well in places where volcanic activity is high and the crust of the earth is thin .
drilled tunnels several kilometers long release steam with a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius -lrb- 392 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is then easily turned into electricity at special power plants around the world from new zealand to the philippines to the west coast of the united states . clean energy worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first geothermal plant was set up in italy a warm climate is not a prerequisite for geothermal energy .
sweden , for example , with its cool temperatures , is a world leader in heating buildings with heat pumps .
this near-surface geothermal energy , as it is known , involves drilling shafts up to 400 meters deep , and inserting pipe-shaped heat exchanging devices to channel the heat to the surface . experts believe that geothermal energy could satisfy the world 's energy needs in the long term - and this could be done in an eco-friendly way .
according to stefan dietrich from germany 's geothermal energy association -lrb- gtv -rrb- , " geothermal energy is one hundred percent clean to produce . " this is the reason why this kind of energy is publicly financed in many european countries - an important factor , considering that deeper drilling is necessary to reach the required temperatures there . iceland : heated streets " without public subsidies , geothermal energy is not cost-effective in central europe , " said horst kreuter from the ngo international geothermal association -lrb- iga -rrb- .
however , he is confident that this situation is not permanent and that geothermal energy will be profitable in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hell 's gate national park in kenya is home to an important geothermal plant iceland is a prime example of the implementation and cost-effectiveness of geothermal energy .
over half of the country 's energy needs are covered with this method .
even one fifth of the electricity supply stems from geothermal power plants .
geothermal power is so affordable there that even some streets in the capital city , reykjavik , are heated in winter . indonesia : hope for affordable electrcity just like iceland , indonesia is a volcanic region .
the country has very good geological conditions for using geothermal energy in electricity production .
despite this , less than half of indonesians have access to electricity , and for those who do , power outages are a common occurrence .
it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .
but these regions also frequently have the perfect conditions for the utilization of geothermal energy . kenya , which straddles the great rift valley , is a prime example of this .
the country is largely dependent on hydro power , but due to ongoing drought , alternative sources of energy are being sought .
geothermal energy is one possibility .
at the moment , kenya has eight geothermal power plants , including the olkaria power plant in the hell 's gate national park north-west of nairobi . many opportunities , few risks " geothermal energy makes a lot of sense in developing countries that have no nationwide electricity network , " said stefan dietrich .
" geothermal energy 's big advantage compared to ordinary energy sources like nuclear and coal-fired plants is its decentralized organization . " however , despite all the opportunities and eco-friendliness it offers , geothermal energy is not completely risk-free .
there are fears that drilling in geographically delicate regions could trigger earthquakes . " when humans are active underground , there are risks , " said horst kreuter .

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .
" the conclusion is clear : this is not about the best tanker and also not about a fair competition . "
possible no-bid contract the us defense department said it was disappointed by the eads-northrop decision , but it denied accusations of unfairness .
the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .

fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .

now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "
the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .
the eu 's 27 member states agreed to limit deficits to 3 percent in their so-called stability and growth pact .
tough decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes shut down public offices across portugal in early march details of the austerity measures included cuts in military spending by 40 percent by 2013 and two-year delays to the planned lisbon-porto and porto-vigo high-speed rail links .
the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .
the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .
the opposition social democratic party declined to comment on the specifics of the plan , but said it would welcome " adjustments made in line with proposals from other parties . "
austerity measures in portugal follow similar cuts in cash-strapped greece , where fears of a credit default have devalued greek bonds and the euro 's worth against foreign currencies. acb / afp / ap / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .
" the conclusion is clear : this is not about the best tanker and also not about a fair competition . "
possible no-bid contract the us defense department said it was disappointed by the eads-northrop decision , but it denied accusations of unfairness .
the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's thomas enders was critical of the pentagon eads and northrop were offering a larger model based on the airbus a330 , which they claimed had greater capability , lower risk and better value despite its size .
fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .
the decision to drop out of the competition was a setback for eads ' plans to expand into the enormous us defense market , where its current presence is relatively small. smh / acb / dpa / ap / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this natural heat can be harnessed for eco-friendly electricity production .
what is more , poor countries can profit from it . the ancient romans knew how to live the good life .
they turned hot springs with sulfurous water into thermal baths , creating health spas for the rich and powerful .
this knowledge of the earth 's heat was passed on to their descendants : modern-day italians who set up the first geothermal power plant italy in 1913 , paving the way for a new form of energy production . today , geothermal energy is used in numerous countries .
it works especially well in places where volcanic activity is high and the crust of the earth is thin .
drilled tunnels several kilometers long release steam with a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius -lrb- 392 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is then easily turned into electricity at special power plants around the world from new zealand to the philippines to the west coast of the united states . clean energy worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first geothermal plant was set up in italy a warm climate is not a prerequisite for geothermal energy .
sweden , for example , with its cool temperatures , is a world leader in heating buildings with heat pumps .
this near-surface geothermal energy , as it is known , involves drilling shafts up to 400 meters deep , and inserting pipe-shaped heat exchanging devices to channel the heat to the surface . experts believe that geothermal energy could satisfy the world 's energy needs in the long term - and this could be done in an eco-friendly way .
according to stefan dietrich from germany 's geothermal energy association -lrb- gtv -rrb- , " geothermal energy is one hundred percent clean to produce . " this is the reason why this kind of energy is publicly financed in many european countries - an important factor , considering that deeper drilling is necessary to reach the required temperatures there . iceland : heated streets " without public subsidies , geothermal energy is not cost-effective in central europe , " said horst kreuter from the ngo international geothermal association -lrb- iga -rrb- .
however , he is confident that this situation is not permanent and that geothermal energy will be profitable in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hell 's gate national park in kenya is home to an important geothermal plant iceland is a prime example of the implementation and cost-effectiveness of geothermal energy .
over half of the country 's energy needs are covered with this method .
even one fifth of the electricity supply stems from geothermal power plants .
geothermal power is so affordable there that even some streets in the capital city , reykjavik , are heated in winter . indonesia : hope for affordable electrcity just like iceland , indonesia is a volcanic region .
the country has very good geological conditions for using geothermal energy in electricity production .
despite this , less than half of indonesians have access to electricity , and for those who do , power outages are a common occurrence .
it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .
but these regions also frequently have the perfect conditions for the utilization of geothermal energy . kenya , which straddles the great rift valley , is a prime example of this .
the country is largely dependent on hydro power , but due to ongoing drought , alternative sources of energy are being sought .
geothermal energy is one possibility .
at the moment , kenya has eight geothermal power plants , including the olkaria power plant in the hell 's gate national park north-west of nairobi . many opportunities , few risks " geothermal energy makes a lot of sense in developing countries that have no nationwide electricity network , " said stefan dietrich .
" geothermal energy 's big advantage compared to ordinary energy sources like nuclear and coal-fired plants is its decentralized organization . " however , despite all the opportunities and eco-friendliness it offers , geothermal energy is not completely risk-free .
there are fears that drilling in geographically delicate regions could trigger earthquakes . " when humans are active underground , there are risks , " said horst kreuter .
" but with geothermal energy , they are very low . " author : nele jensch -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cypriot authorities say they found the stolen body after an anonymous tip-off that steered the police to a cemetery outside of the capital of cyprus , nicosia .
the body has been formerly identified by papadopoulos ' family members .
" we have received the dna test results and the body is that of the late president , " police spokesman michalis katsounodos told reuters .
papadopoulos died in december 2008 of lung cancer and was buried in a cemetery in deftera , a village southwest of nicosia .
the theft of his body was discovered one day before the first anniversary of his death in 2009 .
the disappearance of papadopoulos ' body caused national outrage on the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officers searched the area near papadopoulos ' grave there has been no claim of responsibility for the theft and the motives were unclear .
at the time police said the robbery was " deliberate and carefully planned , " with the perpetrators taking precautions to cover their tracks .
despite suspicions the robbery was financially motivated , papadopoulos ' family members have said no ransom was ever received .
papadopoulos served as president from 2003 until march 2008 .
he lost a bid for a second term in office in 2008 after being defeated by demetris christofias , a former coalition partner .
he was a popular figure with greek cypriots after leading them in rejecting a un plan to reunite the divided island .
turkish cypriots voted in a simultaneous referendum to back the plan , but it failed and the greek sector later joined the eu. cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

99 percent of our planet is hotter than 1000 degrees celsius .
this natural heat can be harnessed for eco-friendly electricity production .
what is more , poor countries can profit from it . the ancient romans knew how to live the good life .
they turned hot springs with sulfurous water into thermal baths , creating health spas for the rich and powerful .
this knowledge of the earth 's heat was passed on to their descendants : modern-day italians who set up the first geothermal power plant italy in 1913 , paving the way for a new form of energy production . today , geothermal energy is used in numerous countries .
it works especially well in places where volcanic activity is high and the crust of the earth is thin .
drilled tunnels several kilometers long release steam with a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius -lrb- 392 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is then easily turned into electricity at special power plants around the world from new zealand to the philippines to the west coast of the united states . clean energy worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first geothermal plant was set up in italy a warm climate is not a prerequisite for geothermal energy .
sweden , for example , with its cool temperatures , is a world leader in heating buildings with heat pumps .
this near-surface geothermal energy , as it is known , involves drilling shafts up to 400 meters deep , and inserting pipe-shaped heat exchanging devices to channel the heat to the surface . experts believe that geothermal energy could satisfy the world 's energy needs in the long term - and this could be done in an eco-friendly way .
according to stefan dietrich from germany 's geothermal energy association -lrb- gtv -rrb- , " geothermal energy is one hundred percent clean to produce . " this is the reason why this kind of energy is publicly financed in many european countries - an important factor , considering that deeper drilling is necessary to reach the required temperatures there . iceland : heated streets " without public subsidies , geothermal energy is not cost-effective in central europe , " said horst kreuter from the ngo international geothermal association -lrb- iga -rrb- .
however , he is confident that this situation is not permanent and that geothermal energy will be profitable in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hell 's gate national park in kenya is home to an important geothermal plant iceland is a prime example of the implementation and cost-effectiveness of geothermal energy .
over half of the country 's energy needs are covered with this method .
even one fifth of the electricity supply stems from geothermal power plants .
geothermal power is so affordable there that even some streets in the capital city , reykjavik , are heated in winter . indonesia : hope for affordable electrcity just like iceland , indonesia is a volcanic region .
the country has very good geological conditions for using geothermal energy in electricity production .
despite this , less than half of indonesians have access to electricity , and for those who do , power outages are a common occurrence .
it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .
but these regions also frequently have the perfect conditions for the utilization of geothermal energy . kenya , which straddles the great rift valley , is a prime example of this .
the country is largely dependent on hydro power , but due to ongoing drought , alternative sources of energy are being sought .
geothermal energy is one possibility .
at the moment , kenya has eight geothermal power plants , including the olkaria power plant in the hell 's gate national park north-west of nairobi . many opportunities , few risks " geothermal energy makes a lot of sense in developing countries that have no nationwide electricity network , " said stefan dietrich .
" geothermal energy 's big advantage compared to ordinary energy sources like nuclear and coal-fired plants is its decentralized organization . " however , despite all the opportunities and eco-friendliness it offers , geothermal energy is not completely risk-free .
there are fears that drilling in geographically delicate regions could trigger earthquakes . " when humans are active underground , there are risks , " said horst kreuter .
" but with geothermal energy , they are very low . " author : nele jensch -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

this knowledge of the earth 's heat was passed on to their descendants : modern-day italians who set up the first geothermal power plant italy in 1913 , paving the way for a new form of energy production . today , geothermal energy is used in numerous countries .
it works especially well in places where volcanic activity is high and the crust of the earth is thin .

sweden , for example , with its cool temperatures , is a world leader in heating buildings with heat pumps .
this near-surface geothermal energy , as it is known , involves drilling shafts up to 400 meters deep , and inserting pipe-shaped heat exchanging devices to channel the heat to the surface . experts believe that geothermal energy could satisfy the world 's energy needs in the long term - and this could be done in an eco-friendly way .
according to stefan dietrich from germany 's geothermal energy association -lrb- gtv -rrb- , " geothermal energy is one hundred percent clean to produce . " this is the reason why this kind of energy is publicly financed in many european countries - an important factor , considering that deeper drilling is necessary to reach the required temperatures there . iceland : heated streets " without public subsidies , geothermal energy is not cost-effective in central europe , " said horst kreuter from the ngo international geothermal association -lrb- iga -rrb- .

it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .

however , he is confident that this situation is not permanent and that geothermal energy will be profitable in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hell 's gate national park in kenya is home to an important geothermal plant iceland is a prime example of the implementation and cost-effectiveness of geothermal energy .
over half of the country 's energy needs are covered with this method .
even one fifth of the electricity supply stems from geothermal power plants .
geothermal power is so affordable there that even some streets in the capital city , reykjavik , are heated in winter . indonesia : hope for affordable electrcity just like iceland , indonesia is a volcanic region .
the country has very good geological conditions for using geothermal energy in electricity production .
despite this , less than half of indonesians have access to electricity , and for those who do , power outages are a common occurrence .
it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .
but these regions also frequently have the perfect conditions for the utilization of geothermal energy . kenya , which straddles the great rift valley , is a prime example of this .
the country is largely dependent on hydro power , but due to ongoing drought , alternative sources of energy are being sought .
geothermal energy is one possibility .
at the moment , kenya has eight geothermal power plants , including the olkaria power plant in the hell 's gate national park north-west of nairobi . many opportunities , few risks " geothermal energy makes a lot of sense in developing countries that have no nationwide electricity network , " said stefan dietrich .
" geothermal energy 's big advantage compared to ordinary energy sources like nuclear and coal-fired plants is its decentralized organization . " however , despite all the opportunities and eco-friendliness it offers , geothermal energy is not completely risk-free .
there are fears that drilling in geographically delicate regions could trigger earthquakes . " when humans are active underground , there are risks , " said horst kreuter .
" but with geothermal energy , they are very low . " author : nele jensch -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "
the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .
the eu 's 27 member states agreed to limit deficits to 3 percent in their so-called stability and growth pact .
tough decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes shut down public offices across portugal in early march details of the austerity measures included cuts in military spending by 40 percent by 2013 and two-year delays to the planned lisbon-porto and porto-vigo high-speed rail links .
the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .
the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .
the opposition social democratic party declined to comment on the specifics of the plan , but said it would welcome " adjustments made in line with proposals from other parties . "
austerity measures in portugal follow similar cuts in cash-strapped greece , where fears of a credit default have devalued greek bonds and the euro 's worth against foreign currencies. acb / afp / ap / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .
" the conclusion is clear : this is not about the best tanker and also not about a fair competition . "
possible no-bid contract the us defense department said it was disappointed by the eads-northrop decision , but it denied accusations of unfairness .
the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's thomas enders was critical of the pentagon eads and northrop were offering a larger model based on the airbus a330 , which they claimed had greater capability , lower risk and better value despite its size .
fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .
the decision to drop out of the competition was a setback for eads ' plans to expand into the enormous us defense market , where its current presence is relatively small. smh / acb / dpa / ap / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .

no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de psychology -pipe- 09.03.2010 sports psychologists make slow inroads into german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : failure before millions of viewers is par for the course in pro athletics professional athletes are under enormous pressure , and for some players the burden can be too much .
in soccer , more than other sports , the taboo on seeking help is a hard one to break .
could change be underway ? ' professional soccer player ' might sound like a dream job : lots of money , adoring fans , and you do n't have to wear a tie to work .
but in reality , the pressure on those chosen few athletes can be unbearably high .
imagine thousands of people watching your every move while you work , screaming - often cursing - at you for even small mistakes .
on top of that , there is a constant threat that illness or injury could end your career in the blink of an eye .
for a long time , dealing with this stress was a job for soccer players to manage alone .
but in recent years , that has begun to change .
since 2006 , the clinical sports psychologist aneta szpigiel has worked with a union that represents german pro soccer players , the vdv .
her office is in a sports-medicine and physical therapy clinic next to the schalke soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen - conveniently located so that players can come to her for help with their problems .
soccer is resistant " we mostly deal with crises that are tied to injuries , to the players ' fears of losing their place on the team , or with returning to play after they were out , " szpigiel said .
" we deal with fears related to their career outlook , with their future in soccer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gestures of frustration can be read in the stands szpigiel 's job is not unusual ; the field of sports psychology has been growing steadily over the past decades , and the business of keeping athletes mentally fit is booming .
what sets her apart , however , is that she works in the field of soccer - a sport that has tended to focus on hard physical workouts and mental toughness over discussing feelings and emotional strength .
jeannine ohlert is a sports psychologist , lecturer and researchers at the prestigious german sport university in cologne ; she agrees that professional soccer is among the most resistant sports when it comes to using team psychologists .
part of the problem is a misunderstanding about what kinds of help sport psychologists can offer , ohlert said .
athletes need to know that the main aim of sports psychologists is " not to solve problems , but to prevent them . "
" the aim of a sport psychologist is that the athletes are able to give their best performance when they need it .
not just in training but in competition , " ohlert said .
popular among team sports team sports are increasingly turning to have sports psychology to improve performance ; both field hockey and ice hockey teams in the germany have had therapists on their staff , ohlert noted .
" but in soccer , it ’ s still not accepted , " she asserted .
bildunterschrift : sometimes it is hard to keep your cool while playing sports the reason is at least partly historical , ohlert speculates .
" i think a lot of -lrb- managers -rrb- are people who played in the clubs themselves when they were younger .
and they say , ' i managed without a sport psychologist .
so the players today will be able to manage by themselves if they are strong enough . '
that 's difficult , " she said .
but vdv 's aneta szpigiel says the job is in fact " a lot like clinical psychology . "
she talks with her clients about the thoughts and emotions ; what 's more , she prescribes exercises for players trying to deal with blockages or injuries .
the aim is to help them regain confidence in a certain series of movements .
" soccer -lrb- here -rrb- is the most popular sport .
there is incredible pressure attached to it , and a lot of money .
the planning starts very early in life : will i be a pro soccer player , or not ?
that is enormous pressure , " she said .
reaction after robert enke 's death playing pro soccer under pressure is anything but new .
wolfgang overath , a star player in the 1970s for fc köln , had trouble dealing with the high expectations put on him by himself and others , even in his day .
" i played in the world cup in mexico 1970 .

but in reality , the pressure on those chosen few athletes can be unbearably high .
imagine thousands of people watching your every move while you work , screaming - often cursing - at you for even small mistakes .
on top of that , there is a constant threat that illness or injury could end your career in the blink of an eye .
for a long time , dealing with this stress was a job for soccer players to manage alone .
but in recent years , that has begun to change .
since 2006 , the clinical sports psychologist aneta szpigiel has worked with a union that represents german pro soccer players , the vdv .
her office is in a sports-medicine and physical therapy clinic next to the schalke soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen - conveniently located so that players can come to her for help with their problems .
soccer is resistant " we mostly deal with crises that are tied to injuries , to the players ' fears of losing their place on the team , or with returning to play after they were out , " szpigiel said .
" we deal with fears related to their career outlook , with their future in soccer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gestures of frustration can be read in the stands szpigiel 's job is not unusual ; the field of sports psychology has been growing steadily over the past decades , and the business of keeping athletes mentally fit is booming .
what sets her apart , however , is that she works in the field of soccer - a sport that has tended to focus on hard physical workouts and mental toughness over discussing feelings and emotional strength .
jeannine ohlert is a sports psychologist , lecturer and researchers at the prestigious german sport university in cologne ; she agrees that professional soccer is among the most resistant sports when it comes to using team psychologists .
part of the problem is a misunderstanding about what kinds of help sport psychologists can offer , ohlert said .
athletes need to know that the main aim of sports psychologists is " not to solve problems , but to prevent them . "
" the aim of a sport psychologist is that the athletes are able to give their best performance when they need it .
not just in training but in competition , " ohlert said .
popular among team sports team sports are increasingly turning to have sports psychology to improve performance ; both field hockey and ice hockey teams in the germany have had therapists on their staff , ohlert noted .
" but in soccer , it ’ s still not accepted , " she asserted .
bildunterschrift : sometimes it is hard to keep your cool while playing sports the reason is at least partly historical , ohlert speculates .
" i think a lot of -lrb- managers -rrb- are people who played in the clubs themselves when they were younger .
and they say , ' i managed without a sport psychologist .
so the players today will be able to manage by themselves if they are strong enough . '
that 's difficult , " she said .
but vdv 's aneta szpigiel says the job is in fact " a lot like clinical psychology . "
she talks with her clients about the thoughts and emotions ; what 's more , she prescribes exercises for players trying to deal with blockages or injuries .
the aim is to help them regain confidence in a certain series of movements .
" soccer -lrb- here -rrb- is the most popular sport .
there is incredible pressure attached to it , and a lot of money .
the planning starts very early in life : will i be a pro soccer player , or not ?
that is enormous pressure , " she said .

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .
they have also voiced their concern that the country ’ s over 2,000 political prisoners , who include nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , will not be able to take part in the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has been under house arrest for over 14 of the past 20 years will national league for democracy participate ? the last elections in myanmar were held in 1990 .
they were won by suu kyi 's opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- but the junta never recognized the results . so far , the nld has not confirmed whether it will take part in this year 's polls .
as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .
the election laws include one on registering political parties , which will give some indication on how long the campaign period could last and effectively give a time frame for the polls . until now the junta has insisted the elections will take place this year . author : disha uppal editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "
the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .
the eu 's 27 member states agreed to limit deficits to 3 percent in their so-called stability and growth pact .
tough decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikes shut down public offices across portugal in early march details of the austerity measures included cuts in military spending by 40 percent by 2013 and two-year delays to the planned lisbon-porto and porto-vigo high-speed rail links .
the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .
the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .
the opposition social democratic party declined to comment on the specifics of the plan , but said it would welcome " adjustments made in line with proposals from other parties . "
austerity measures in portugal follow similar cuts in cash-strapped greece , where fears of a credit default have devalued greek bonds and the euro 's worth against foreign currencies. acb / afp / ap / reuters editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .

" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "

one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 09.03.2010 germany debates extending the statute of limitations for sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the reported abuse cases happened too long ago as more and more allegations of sexual abuse in catholic institutions come to light , german politicians debate whether to extend the statute of limitations for civil and criminal prosecution . a rash of reported cases of sexual abuse and molestation in schools and other institutions run by the catholic church in germany has led to a discussion about whether the country 's time limit on civil and criminal prosecution of abuse cases should be raised .
most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .
he is not implicated in any of the abuse allegations. svs / kna / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel and juncker discussed the proposed plan to set up a european monetary fund similar to the international monetary fund , intended to help countries deeply in debt get back on track .
merkel stressed , however , that a series of sanctions would first have to considered , to prevent countries from building up their debts in the first place .
she hinted at possible penalties , including the temporary removal of a country 's voting rights in the european council .
both merkel and juncker cautioned that such a fund was not intended for greece .
" this is a plan for the future , " said merkel .
curb trading of credit default swaps also on tuesday , germany and france announced plans to set out proposals to curb or ban financial market speculation , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy will write a joint letter to european commission president jose manuel barroso outlining their proposals .
these include plans to regulate speculation against falling company share prices or loan losses and guards against speculating against the threatened bankruptcies of entire countries , including the trading of credit default swaps .
luxembourg and greece also lent their support for the latter initiative .
" we all agree that we need to prevent financial speculation , " said merkel .
" we believe that the persistent speculation against the euro zone countries gives cause to quickly implement these proposals , " she added , referring to the recent financial troubles of greece. cmk / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .
" the conclusion is clear : this is not about the best tanker and also not about a fair competition . "
possible no-bid contract the us defense department said it was disappointed by the eads-northrop decision , but it denied accusations of unfairness .
the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's thomas enders was critical of the pentagon eads and northrop were offering a larger model based on the airbus a330 , which they claimed had greater capability , lower risk and better value despite its size .
fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .
the decision to drop out of the competition was a setback for eads ' plans to expand into the enormous us defense market , where its current presence is relatively small. smh / acb / dpa / ap / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "
the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .

the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .
the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .

the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .

the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .
the opposition social democratic party declined to comment on the specifics of the plan , but said it would welcome " adjustments made in line with proposals from other parties . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 09.03.2010 myanmar unveils new election laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. gen. than shwe , the leader of myanmar 's junta the military junta of myanmar , which is also known as burma , unveiled the first details of new election laws on tuesday . according to the state-run newspapers , the regime enacted five laws on monday to pave the way for the polls that are planned for later this year .
however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .
they have also voiced their concern that the country ’ s over 2,000 political prisoners , who include nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , will not be able to take part in the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has been under house arrest for over 14 of the past 20 years will national league for democracy participate ? the last elections in myanmar were held in 1990 .
they were won by suu kyi 's opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- but the junta never recognized the results . so far , the nld has not confirmed whether it will take part in this year 's polls .
as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .
the election laws include one on registering political parties , which will give some indication on how long the campaign period could last and effectively give a time frame for the polls . until now the junta has insisted the elections will take place this year . author : disha uppal editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .

" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .

leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 09.03.2010 germany has love-hate relationship to daring pop art guru mel ramos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel ramos turns 75 this year some say mel ramos revolutionized art in the 1960s by melding it with advertising .
a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .
they have also voiced their concern that the country ’ s over 2,000 political prisoners , who include nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , will not be able to take part in the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has been under house arrest for over 14 of the past 20 years will national league for democracy participate ? the last elections in myanmar were held in 1990 .
they were won by suu kyi 's opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- but the junta never recognized the results . so far , the nld has not confirmed whether it will take part in this year 's polls .
as zin linn , one of the leaders of the burmese community in exile in thailand , explained , the party doesn ’ t think it has enough time to prepare . " daw aung san suu kyi says this election should not be held this year .
according to the 1990 example , the election laws were released one year ahead of time .
at that time , the opposition was also criticized because one year was not enough to form a party and organize . " the final decision on whether to participate will be made once all the details on the election laws have been released , some nld members have said .
the election laws include one on registering political parties , which will give some indication on how long the campaign period could last and effectively give a time frame for the polls . until now the junta has insisted the elections will take place this year . author : disha uppal editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.03.2010 migrant workers risk deportation from thailand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the thai authorities were criticized for deporting illegal immigrants by ship with very little food and water bangkok said on monday it would jail migrant workers caught at mass anti-government protests planned for this weekend .
there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for example , kenya 's olkaria geothermal power plants are located in the great rift valley - a long fracture zone running from lebanon to mozambique . here , water vapor at a temperature of 300 to 350 degrees celsius is channeled to the surface from a depth of around 2,000 meters via several shafts to turn the steam turbines and produce electricity .
the potential for this kind of power generation is huge , but only a fraction of it is being currently exploited . author : antonia roetger -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

99 percent of our planet is hotter than 1000 degrees celsius .
this natural heat can be harnessed for eco-friendly electricity production .
what is more , poor countries can profit from it . the ancient romans knew how to live the good life .
they turned hot springs with sulfurous water into thermal baths , creating health spas for the rich and powerful .
this knowledge of the earth 's heat was passed on to their descendants : modern-day italians who set up the first geothermal power plant italy in 1913 , paving the way for a new form of energy production . today , geothermal energy is used in numerous countries .
it works especially well in places where volcanic activity is high and the crust of the earth is thin .
drilled tunnels several kilometers long release steam with a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius -lrb- 392 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is then easily turned into electricity at special power plants around the world from new zealand to the philippines to the west coast of the united states . clean energy worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first geothermal plant was set up in italy a warm climate is not a prerequisite for geothermal energy .
sweden , for example , with its cool temperatures , is a world leader in heating buildings with heat pumps .
this near-surface geothermal energy , as it is known , involves drilling shafts up to 400 meters deep , and inserting pipe-shaped heat exchanging devices to channel the heat to the surface . experts believe that geothermal energy could satisfy the world 's energy needs in the long term - and this could be done in an eco-friendly way .
according to stefan dietrich from germany 's geothermal energy association -lrb- gtv -rrb- , " geothermal energy is one hundred percent clean to produce . " this is the reason why this kind of energy is publicly financed in many european countries - an important factor , considering that deeper drilling is necessary to reach the required temperatures there . iceland : heated streets " without public subsidies , geothermal energy is not cost-effective in central europe , " said horst kreuter from the ngo international geothermal association -lrb- iga -rrb- .
however , he is confident that this situation is not permanent and that geothermal energy will be profitable in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hell 's gate national park in kenya is home to an important geothermal plant iceland is a prime example of the implementation and cost-effectiveness of geothermal energy .
over half of the country 's energy needs are covered with this method .
even one fifth of the electricity supply stems from geothermal power plants .
geothermal power is so affordable there that even some streets in the capital city , reykjavik , are heated in winter . indonesia : hope for affordable electrcity just like iceland , indonesia is a volcanic region .
the country has very good geological conditions for using geothermal energy in electricity production .
despite this , less than half of indonesians have access to electricity , and for those who do , power outages are a common occurrence .
it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .
but these regions also frequently have the perfect conditions for the utilization of geothermal energy . kenya , which straddles the great rift valley , is a prime example of this .
the country is largely dependent on hydro power , but due to ongoing drought , alternative sources of energy are being sought .
geothermal energy is one possibility .
at the moment , kenya has eight geothermal power plants , including the olkaria power plant in the hell 's gate national park north-west of nairobi . many opportunities , few risks " geothermal energy makes a lot of sense in developing countries that have no nationwide electricity network , " said stefan dietrich .
" geothermal energy 's big advantage compared to ordinary energy sources like nuclear and coal-fired plants is its decentralized organization . " however , despite all the opportunities and eco-friendliness it offers , geothermal energy is not completely risk-free .
there are fears that drilling in geographically delicate regions could trigger earthquakes . " when humans are active underground , there are risks , " said horst kreuter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de housing -pipe- 09.03.2010 silence reigns in ireland 's new suburbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen to 17 percent of ireland 's housing is unoccupied since its building boom ended , ireland has become a land of unoccupied and half-finished houses .
now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .
he is not implicated in any of the abuse allegations. svs / kna / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de housing -pipe- 09.03.2010 silence reigns in ireland 's new suburbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen to 17 percent of ireland 's housing is unoccupied since its building boom ended , ireland has become a land of unoccupied and half-finished houses .
now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

-lrb- 16.02.2010 -rrb- ireland 's parliament opens debate on historic " bad bank " gamble ireland 's government wants to push through a bid to create a " bad bank " to soak up junk investments in the us housing market .
the move aims to avoid a collapse in the banking system but could double the country 's debt .

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .
he is not implicated in any of the abuse allegations. svs / kna / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 09.03.2010 germany debates extending the statute of limitations for sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the reported abuse cases happened too long ago as more and more allegations of sexual abuse in catholic institutions come to light , german politicians debate whether to extend the statute of limitations for civil and criminal prosecution . a rash of reported cases of sexual abuse and molestation in schools and other institutions run by the catholic church in germany has led to a discussion about whether the country 's time limit on civil and criminal prosecution of abuse cases should be raised .
most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .
he is not implicated in any of the abuse allegations. svs / kna / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

in soccer , more than other sports , the taboo on seeking help is a hard one to break .
could change be underway ? ' professional soccer player ' might sound like a dream job : lots of money , adoring fans , and you do n't have to wear a tie to work .
but in reality , the pressure on those chosen few athletes can be unbearably high .
imagine thousands of people watching your every move while you work , screaming - often cursing - at you for even small mistakes .
on top of that , there is a constant threat that illness or injury could end your career in the blink of an eye .
for a long time , dealing with this stress was a job for soccer players to manage alone .
but in recent years , that has begun to change .
since 2006 , the clinical sports psychologist aneta szpigiel has worked with a union that represents german pro soccer players , the vdv .
her office is in a sports-medicine and physical therapy clinic next to the schalke soccer stadium in gelsenkirchen - conveniently located so that players can come to her for help with their problems .
soccer is resistant " we mostly deal with crises that are tied to injuries , to the players ' fears of losing their place on the team , or with returning to play after they were out , " szpigiel said .
" we deal with fears related to their career outlook , with their future in soccer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gestures of frustration can be read in the stands szpigiel 's job is not unusual ; the field of sports psychology has been growing steadily over the past decades , and the business of keeping athletes mentally fit is booming .
what sets her apart , however , is that she works in the field of soccer - a sport that has tended to focus on hard physical workouts and mental toughness over discussing feelings and emotional strength .
jeannine ohlert is a sports psychologist , lecturer and researchers at the prestigious german sport university in cologne ; she agrees that professional soccer is among the most resistant sports when it comes to using team psychologists .
part of the problem is a misunderstanding about what kinds of help sport psychologists can offer , ohlert said .
athletes need to know that the main aim of sports psychologists is " not to solve problems , but to prevent them . "
" the aim of a sport psychologist is that the athletes are able to give their best performance when they need it .
not just in training but in competition , " ohlert said .
popular among team sports team sports are increasingly turning to have sports psychology to improve performance ; both field hockey and ice hockey teams in the germany have had therapists on their staff , ohlert noted .
" but in soccer , it ’ s still not accepted , " she asserted .
bildunterschrift : sometimes it is hard to keep your cool while playing sports the reason is at least partly historical , ohlert speculates .
" i think a lot of -lrb- managers -rrb- are people who played in the clubs themselves when they were younger .
and they say , ' i managed without a sport psychologist .
so the players today will be able to manage by themselves if they are strong enough . '
that 's difficult , " she said .
but vdv 's aneta szpigiel says the job is in fact " a lot like clinical psychology . "
she talks with her clients about the thoughts and emotions ; what 's more , she prescribes exercises for players trying to deal with blockages or injuries .
the aim is to help them regain confidence in a certain series of movements .
" soccer -lrb- here -rrb- is the most popular sport .
there is incredible pressure attached to it , and a lot of money .
the planning starts very early in life : will i be a pro soccer player , or not ?
that is enormous pressure , " she said .
reaction after robert enke 's death playing pro soccer under pressure is anything but new .
wolfgang overath , a star player in the 1970s for fc köln , had trouble dealing with the high expectations put on him by himself and others , even in his day .
" i played in the world cup in mexico 1970 .
and then günter netzer played the european championship in 1972 .
he was in great form and mine was getting worse and worse at club level , and then the public said : now netzer should play , " overath recounted .
" i kept getting worse because i had less and less self-confidence .
that is something that can happen when the pressure gets higher . "
back in the 1970s , however , access to professional help for players was much less readily available .
today , though , the sports professionals are busy people .
szpigiel noted that , especially after the suicide death of german national team goalie robert enke in november , 2009 , many professionals had a sudden need to talk .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athletes often perform better in practice than in competition still , szpigiel says she wishes that in the future , psychological help for athletes could be even more commonplace .
" i believe that sports psychologists should become even more widely accepted than they are today , " szpigiel said .

room for improvement if soccer teams had a staff of psychologists , they could work on " communication , cohesion , structures ... so many things , " ohlert said , with the ultimate goal being to strengthen players to stand up to the pressures of pro athletics .
meanwhile , ohlert points out that more german clubs - she gives hoffenheim as an example - are starting to turn to sport psychologists .
" it getting better , " she said .

it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .

it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "

a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv asia + : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 09.03.2010 would you work better if your boss were a woman ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that increasing the numbers of women in management positions has a positive effect on the economy .
but do people experience this on a day-to-day level ?
what experiences or expectations do you have ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : ahmed farouk el w. · country : egypt first of all , i do n't like to work with my boss is a woman .
my performance will be better if my boss is a man .
my experience is : woman management is aggressive because she try to prove herself and she are very fast to apply punishment .
in man case , he drive the firm more wisely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : rahul d. · country : india yes definitely .
i would have worked even much better if my boss were a woman .
this is because here in india , the society is male-dominated .
so it is obvious that they are responsible for their household works and have to manage it by their own .
so women who are working professionals have to manage both their household work as well as job .
that is to say that they are good at management .
so it 's obvious that if a person has been trained by a woman boss would definitely be good at what he does .
the output is always received corresponding to the input .
so ...
i hope it 's justified ... is n't it ? ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : mogire m. · country : kenya well there is nothing i love like having a woman boss .
they are rather understanding lovely and create a lovely atmosphere in the office .
with a woman boss am sure the office is ever clean .
take for example the first day of the week ... a man boss will definitely be in the office late after drinking himself off over the weekend … i love female bosses they feel responsible for office work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : · name : supria · country : india gladly i would work for a woman as my boss .
at least , they are less likely to have the bossy attitude and ego ! !
they are not all hard working for sure - they have always had the knack of getting their job done by their men under them ! ! send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .

the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .
the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .
the opposition social democratic party declined to comment on the specifics of the plan , but said it would welcome " adjustments made in line with proposals from other parties . "

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "
the government hopes to achieve a 2.8 percent budget deficit by 2013 , down from its record 9.3 percent in 2009 .
the eu 's 27 member states agreed to limit deficits to 3 percent in their so-called stability and growth pact .

the plan is likely to be unpopular with public sector workers , tens of thousands of whom went on strike last week to protest wage freezes and other spending cuts .
the minority socialist government urged opposition leaders to embrace the plan , calling it a " national effort " that was vital to the country 's economic success .
the opposition social democratic party declined to comment on the specifics of the plan , but said it would welcome " adjustments made in line with proposals from other parties . "

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .
" the conclusion is clear : this is not about the best tanker and also not about a fair competition . "
possible no-bid contract the us defense department said it was disappointed by the eads-northrop decision , but it denied accusations of unfairness .
the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's thomas enders was critical of the pentagon eads and northrop were offering a larger model based on the airbus a330 , which they claimed had greater capability , lower risk and better value despite its size .
fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .
the decision to drop out of the competition was a setback for eads ' plans to expand into the enormous us defense market , where its current presence is relatively small. smh / acb / dpa / ap / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

american rival boeing is now the only bidder . the eu has warned washington of negative consequences for future defense deals between the us and europe if a recent contract for air force air-refuelling tankers is proven to have favored a us company . the european commission called the decision by a european-led consortium not to submit a bid for the pentagon 's contract for refuelling tankers " highly regrettable . " " the european commission would be extremely concerned if it were to emerge that the terms of tender were such as to inhibit open competition for the contract , " a statement from brussels said . bildunterschrift : boeing 's smaller kc-767 model is poised to win the german government also expressed disappointment . " even in the acquisition of munitions , free competition should not be unilaterally restricted , " economics minister rainer bruederle said .
european aerospace giant eads withdrew its bid on monday for $ 35 billion -lrb- 25.7 billion euros -rrb- in tanker plane contracts with the us air force , saying the terms of the deal appeared designed to favor a smaller jet offered by american rival boeing .
the announcement left boeing as the only bidder .
the european aeronautic defense and space company , parent company of airbus , had joined forces with us firm northrop grumman to compete with boeing over the contract to build 179 tankers , which refuel warplanes .
the eads move came after northrop grumman dropped out of the bid for the contract , which would have guaranteed thousands of manufacturing jobs in britain , france , germany and spain .
hours after dropping its bid the european aerospace giant announced it lost 763 million euros -lrb- 1.04 billion dollars -rrb- in 2009 . bitter battle comes to an end the decision followed a two-year struggle against american protectionism , and ended a bitter political battle over the deal , which is among the biggest us defense procurement projects on record .
in presenting his decision , airbus ceo thomas enders criticized the pentagon for presenting guidelines that he said clearly favored chicago-based boeing .
" the current bid is clearly tailored to the smaller and less-capable refueller of the competition , " enders told german press agency dpa .
" the conclusion is clear : this is not about the best tanker and also not about a fair competition . "
possible no-bid contract the us defense department said it was disappointed by the eads-northrop decision , but it denied accusations of unfairness .
the pentagon may now be forced to award a contract to boeing without any competition , a practice us president barack obama has sharply criticized as a bad deal for taxpayers .
meanwhile , boeing used the announcement to talk up its own model for the tanker , based on the commercial 767 .
" the boeing newgen tanker will be safe and survivable in combat , will save the american taxpayer $ 10 billion in fuel costs over its 40-year life , and is american-designed and built , " boeing spokesman bill barksdale said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's thomas enders was critical of the pentagon eads and northrop were offering a larger model based on the airbus a330 , which they claimed had greater capability , lower risk and better value despite its size .
fight for jobs the air force has sought to replace its 1950s-era set of boeing tanker planes for years .
the pentagon originally awarded the contract to eads and northrop , leading critics in the us to decry a loss of jobs to european manufacturers when they were most needed at home .
boeing was later able to convince a congressional oversight agency to reverse its decision in june 2008 , and the defense department officially reopened the competition last month .
support for eads-northrop was concentrated in southern states because of northrop 's promise to build an assembly plant in alabama .
the aerospace duo said 58 percent of the plane and its parts would be assembled by american labor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.03.2010 latvia eases immigration restrictions in bid for cash infusion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia regained its independence in 1991 latvia is desperate to attract new investors that could help the recovery of the country ’ s weak economy .
but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .

" probably they get involved in other business projects .

soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de housing -pipe- 09.03.2010 silence reigns in ireland 's new suburbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen to 17 percent of ireland 's housing is unoccupied since its building boom ended , ireland has become a land of unoccupied and half-finished houses .
now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

cypriot authorities say they found the stolen body after an anonymous tip-off that steered the police to a cemetery outside of the capital of cyprus , nicosia .
the body has been formerly identified by papadopoulos ' family members .
" we have received the dna test results and the body is that of the late president , " police spokesman michalis katsounodos told reuters .
papadopoulos died in december 2008 of lung cancer and was buried in a cemetery in deftera , a village southwest of nicosia .
the theft of his body was discovered one day before the first anniversary of his death in 2009 .
the disappearance of papadopoulos ' body caused national outrage on the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officers searched the area near papadopoulos ' grave there has been no claim of responsibility for the theft and the motives were unclear .
at the time police said the robbery was " deliberate and carefully planned , " with the perpetrators taking precautions to cover their tracks .
despite suspicions the robbery was financially motivated , papadopoulos ' family members have said no ransom was ever received .
papadopoulos served as president from 2003 until march 2008 .
he lost a bid for a second term in office in 2008 after being defeated by demetris christofias , a former coalition partner .
he was a popular figure with greek cypriots after leading them in rejecting a un plan to reunite the divided island .
turkish cypriots voted in a simultaneous referendum to back the plan , but it failed and the greek sector later joined the eu. cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

99 percent of our planet is hotter than 1000 degrees celsius .
this natural heat can be harnessed for eco-friendly electricity production .
what is more , poor countries can profit from it . the ancient romans knew how to live the good life .
they turned hot springs with sulfurous water into thermal baths , creating health spas for the rich and powerful .
this knowledge of the earth 's heat was passed on to their descendants : modern-day italians who set up the first geothermal power plant italy in 1913 , paving the way for a new form of energy production . today , geothermal energy is used in numerous countries .
it works especially well in places where volcanic activity is high and the crust of the earth is thin .
drilled tunnels several kilometers long release steam with a temperature of more than 200 degrees celsius -lrb- 392 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is then easily turned into electricity at special power plants around the world from new zealand to the philippines to the west coast of the united states . clean energy worldwide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first geothermal plant was set up in italy a warm climate is not a prerequisite for geothermal energy .
sweden , for example , with its cool temperatures , is a world leader in heating buildings with heat pumps .
this near-surface geothermal energy , as it is known , involves drilling shafts up to 400 meters deep , and inserting pipe-shaped heat exchanging devices to channel the heat to the surface . experts believe that geothermal energy could satisfy the world 's energy needs in the long term - and this could be done in an eco-friendly way .
according to stefan dietrich from germany 's geothermal energy association -lrb- gtv -rrb- , " geothermal energy is one hundred percent clean to produce . " this is the reason why this kind of energy is publicly financed in many european countries - an important factor , considering that deeper drilling is necessary to reach the required temperatures there . iceland : heated streets " without public subsidies , geothermal energy is not cost-effective in central europe , " said horst kreuter from the ngo international geothermal association -lrb- iga -rrb- .
however , he is confident that this situation is not permanent and that geothermal energy will be profitable in the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hell 's gate national park in kenya is home to an important geothermal plant iceland is a prime example of the implementation and cost-effectiveness of geothermal energy .
over half of the country 's energy needs are covered with this method .
even one fifth of the electricity supply stems from geothermal power plants .
geothermal power is so affordable there that even some streets in the capital city , reykjavik , are heated in winter . indonesia : hope for affordable electrcity just like iceland , indonesia is a volcanic region .
the country has very good geological conditions for using geothermal energy in electricity production .
despite this , less than half of indonesians have access to electricity , and for those who do , power outages are a common occurrence .
it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .
but these regions also frequently have the perfect conditions for the utilization of geothermal energy . kenya , which straddles the great rift valley , is a prime example of this .
the country is largely dependent on hydro power , but due to ongoing drought , alternative sources of energy are being sought .
geothermal energy is one possibility .
at the moment , kenya has eight geothermal power plants , including the olkaria power plant in the hell 's gate national park north-west of nairobi . many opportunities , few risks " geothermal energy makes a lot of sense in developing countries that have no nationwide electricity network , " said stefan dietrich .
" geothermal energy 's big advantage compared to ordinary energy sources like nuclear and coal-fired plants is its decentralized organization . " however , despite all the opportunities and eco-friendliness it offers , geothermal energy is not completely risk-free .
there are fears that drilling in geographically delicate regions could trigger earthquakes . " when humans are active underground , there are risks , " said horst kreuter .
" but with geothermal energy , they are very low . " author : nele jensch -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this warmth can be used for heating , cooling and electricity production . at a depth of 25 meters -lrb- 82 feet -rrb- below the earth 's surface the temperature remains constant , regardless of the weather or location .
for every 100 meters further down , it increases by 3 to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . in germany , utilizing the earth 's natural warmth for heating is quite widespread .
the heat and power plant in neubrandenburg , for example , channels hot water with a temperature between 55 and 80 degrees celsius from a depth of around 1,300 meters to the surface . the water passes on its heat via a heat exchanger to a district heating network and then flows back underground through another shaft .
with the help of heat pumps and geothermal collectors , some houses are heated entirely with this natural method . for generating electricity with steam turbines , temperatures of at least 150 degrees celsius are needed .
in germany , these temperatures can only be found at a depth of 2,500 to 4,500 meters , which is why the country only has a few small geothermal power plants . in order to test geothermal electricity production methods , experts from the gfz german research centre for geosciences in potsdam are performing drillings up to 4,300 meters deep in a geothermal lab in brandenburg . this kind of energy production is much easier in regions with volcanic activity , such as iceland , italy and kenya .
for example , kenya 's olkaria geothermal power plants are located in the great rift valley - a long fracture zone running from lebanon to mozambique . here , water vapor at a temperature of 300 to 350 degrees celsius is channeled to the surface from a depth of around 2,000 meters via several shafts to turn the steam turbines and produce electricity .

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair . " the referendum two years ago made clear that the military government is trying to manipulate the whole process and i fear that this might also be the case in these elections that the military regime government might manipulate them . " critics are also worried about the fact that political leaders in myanmar lack freedom .

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 09.03.2010 germany has love-hate relationship to daring pop art guru mel ramos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel ramos turns 75 this year some say mel ramos revolutionized art in the 1960s by melding it with advertising .
a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .

" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "

most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .
he is not implicated in any of the abuse allegations. svs / kna / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .
measha brueggergosman will be singing from her new album " night and dreams " at the deutsche welle-sponsored " concerto discreto " series in bonn 's arithmeum hall on march 15 , 2010 .

it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .

well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 09.03.2010 soprano brueggergosman 's ' long , languid ' album is an ode to night großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a ' sacredness ' to this album , the singer says soprano measha brueggergosman just released her second album on deutsche grammophon .
it pays tribute to night time , with european works in five languages . measha brueggergosman 's new album " night and dreams " features works by a host of composers , including debussy , brahms , franz liszt and mozart , among many others .
the classically trained canadian singer studied both in her home country and in germany .
but while she is versed in the classics , she admits she 's addicted to pop culture .
a part-time tv host and wannabe yoga instructor , brueggergosman found it hard to make time for an interview .
but when she did , she revealed the vibrant personality so many viewers find riveting on stage .
recently , brueggergosman dazzled viewers when she sang the olympic hymn at the winter games in vancouver .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brueggergosman says dreams unite her fellow creatures of the night deutsche welle spoke to her about her love of the night - and of the german language .
deutsche welle : you 've chosen " night and dreams " as the title and topic of your new cd .
why ?
measha brueggergosman : we wanted to do something different from " surprise , " which was my first album on deutsche grammophon and which was percussive and funny and a little dirty and slightly " alternative . "
so we wanted to find something that was long and languid and gave me a chance to " blow . "
it is beautiful music for beautiful music 's sake and although we featured composers who are core classical composers , it also gave me the chance to be slightly subversive by combining -lsb- franz -rsb- schubert and -lsb- francis -rsb- hime for example , or -lsb- xavier -rsb- montsalvatge and -lsb- henri -rsb- duparc , who i guess are not that far apart , but peter warlock and mozart , for instance .
what 's the feel of the album ?
i kind of picture people putting it on at a dinner party or at night .
i am a nocturnal creature , so justus zeyen - the pianist on this album - and i , we were really looking for poetry that would not only evoke an atmosphere of romanticism , but , i dunno , we kinda want people to make out while they 're listening to it .
i think there should be more music in classical music that people just want to make out to .
i think it 's important that we provide a soundtrack for people 's lives … all aspects of people 's lives !
which pieces do you like best ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' it 's a shame i have to come in on the piano in some of these songs ' i 'd never done duparc 's " phidyle " because it 's typically a man 's song .
i had never sung the lizst , " oh !
quand je dors , " even though it had been recommended to me so many times ... oh , and i love the " clair du lune … " there 's just something about that piece , especially the relationship that the piano and the voice share .
it 's so intricately woven - it almost feels unfortunate that i have to come in because justus just plays the crap out of it .
and speaking of justus - well , hime 's " anoiteceu " - the only piece in portuguese on the album , well , i just think justus plays the snot of it .
he 's very inspiring .
was there a reason to choose so many different languages , or was it really because of the texts and music themselves ?
the whole concept and reasoning behind doing so many different was really to showcase the different linguistic approaches to nocturnal activities , you know , how " night " sounds in portuguese , how " the moon " is described in german , how duparc candles through french , the idea of dreams or " la nuit " - these kinds of subtleties that are linguistic ones but also speak to a culture … there 's a way that schubert sets " an den mond " or strauss sets " wiegenlied . "
there 's only really one way to do it … it sets the language where it is most descriptive .
that is what the best composers do .
so , you do n't really think about it .
duparc is french , faure is french , de falla is spanish , and these composers embody the best of what language can do , musically , percussively , compositionally , poetically .
earlier , you described your album " surprise " as a bit " dirty . "
what did you mean by that ?
well , it 's bit slummy ... i mean there 's subject matter on " surprise " that we do n't find on " night and dreams , " but that is the nature of cabaret .
whereas this piece … i mean , i 'm not saying this album is classier , because it 's still me singing it , but i do think there 's a sacredness , a sense of occasion to this kind of repertoire , to this track list , that makes everything … calming .
it 's a stress-free zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer said her last album was a bit ' slummy ' why classical music ?
i often say that i do believe that classical music chose me .
i do n't know if it would have been my natural inclination .
i think i am very much a product of nurture over nature .
i mean the musical tradition of my home church in fredericton , on the east coast of new brunswick , was classical .
my father worked for the cbc , which at that time had predominantly classical programming , and that was the only radio station we listened to , so when it came time for me to take piano and voice lesson , there was a structure there .
you speak german .
does that come from your training , or did you learn it growing up ?
i learned it for love .
i was lucky enough to marry my first love , and he is swiss , from the german part of switzerland , and then , i knew that i would probably work a lot in the german repertoire .
german is a tough nut to crack linguistically if you do n't speak it .
it really doubles your workload , just through translations alone .
so i knew that if i was going to learn a third language , it would have to be german .
you 're also a tv host .
what attracts you to that medium ?
i 'm genuinely interested in other art forms , so when the " arte lounge " came along , or " cribs " or " video on trial " or any of these kinds of extracurricular activities that i do come along , i do them because they 're great fun , actually .
because i 'm kind of addicted to pop culture .
all these horrible tv shows , i mean they 're really bad sometimes , but still , i kind of love it all , because it keeps me fresh , keeps me connected to the audience that i love to reach and that will hopefully ultimately give classical music a chance .
but at the end of the day , i am grateful that i am in this corner of culture that i 've found myself in .
who are you trying to appeal to ?
looking at your website , you 're not a typical classical singer .
are you trying to bring classical music down from the ivory tower ?
what 's funny is that i do n't think i would listen to classical music if i were n't a classical musician .
i rarely listen to it .
if i 'm being honest , i 'm really only own either the repertoire of my friends , or repertoire that i need to learn .
but i 'm an exploratory spirit , i like to find out new things , research things … and i have enough energy for extracurricular things , like interviews and a cute website and i want people to be able to come to the website and not find out just about classical music , but also about me as a person , or what i enjoy ... there are a lot of cool people in this profession , a lot of really hip , connected people in this classical world .
bildunterschrift : ' out of this world ' - canadian brueggergosman sings the olympic anthem in vancouver , 2010 what was it like singing at the winter olympics in vancouver this year ?
i mean , it was 2.5 billion people watching , and 60,000 people in the stadium .
it was out of this world .
as soon at the olympics were announced , as soon as vancouver won the bid , i said : " well , let 's start workin ' , ' cuz i wanna be there . "
i would have been third chorister from the right in the back just to sing there … i am thankful that i sang the olympic hymn .
i have always been a proud canadian and in that moment , well , there was a little something extra .
where do you think you 'll go from here ?
i 'm going to become a bikram yoga instructor .
i 'm going to take a course this spring , so that will be another skill that i can put on my resume .
i may someday open a bikram yoga studio in my hometown and i know that really has nothing to do with singing and i know there is probably another answer i should have .
i do n't need to be the best singer ; i just want to be really good at my own voice , really good at promoting this genre of music and i just really want to have fun with my friends and watch my nieces and nephews grow up and not miss too much .

however , only information about the law concerning the new election commission has been publicly disclosed . the new rules stipulate that the upcoming elections in myanmar will be overseen by a five-member election commission .
all of the commission members must be at least 50 years old , they say .
they must all be " eminent people with a good reputation " and can not be members of a political party . the new law states that the election commission will have the power to cancel elections in places where voting is hampered by a natural disaster or by the local security situation .
the election commission 's decisions will be final , says the junta . lack of credibility many observers fear that the elections in the military-ruled country will lack further credibility because of the fact that the government will appoint the election commission . however , derek tonkin , a former british diplomat and the chairman of network myanmar in uk could see no other alternative .
" of course , in any other country , election commissions are appointed by parliament under an act of parliament and the government is not responsible , " he said . " in myanmar at the present time , it is not clear how else the election commission could be appointed other than by the military regime because there is no political registration law so the parties can not appoint them and there is no parliament in existence yet . " tonkin adds that although the elections in myanmar are supposed to mark the transition from over 40 years of military rule to democracy , one should not expect change to happen overnight . doubts that the elections will be free and fair for marco bünte , an expert from the german institute of global and area studies , says there is some way to go .
" it is good that the country will have an elected government but i am not that optimistic these elections will be free and fair .

portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos told reporters at a news conference monday that spending cuts would be the focus of the plan , while tax hikes would be limited to the wealthy .
" this is a bet on reducing the weight of the state in the economy and the weight of public spending , " he said .
" the plan has to be credible to restore confidence . "

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

but its recent easing of visa restrictions for non-eu citizens has sparked a nationalist outcry . in an effort to stimulate its struggling economy , the latvian parliament eased restrictions for non-european union investors to obtain legal residency in the baltic country , leading some to fear a russian immigrant invasion .
the changes , which are to take effect on july 1 this year , allow five-year residence permits to citizens of countries outside the eu if they invest at least 25,000 lats -lrb- 35,000 euros -rrb- in a local company , or if they own expensive property in the country .
riga mayor nils usakovs proposed the idea , saying that fears of increased russian immigration were unfounded .
he told deutsche welle that the changes will only help the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the new law could threaten latvian culture " if -lrb- foreigners -rrb- buy property or they invest money in the latvian economy , they stay here , they spend money here , " said usakovs , who also leads the russian opposition party consensus center .
" probably they get involved in other business projects .
so i imagine , it helps to overcome the crisis . "
soviet memories despite winning approval in parliament , right-wing nationalists as well as ordinary citizens have protested the changes .
about 100 demonstrators gathered at the parliament building in riga last week singing the national anthem and carrying signs that read " let 's sell the corrupt members of parliament but not our land ! "
" instead of doing business with properties and temporary residence permits , the government should think of how to boost production , " one woman said .
conservative parliamentarian peteris tabuns spoke against the amendment , saying the new guidelines would increase russian control of the economy , and eventually politics .
" you 'll see an investor arriving with five , 10 , 15 and 20 children , grandmothers and so on , " he said during parliamentary debate .
" we have seen it already during the soviet occupation .
they 'll speak their native language and will ignore the latvian laws and virtues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic russians form nearly 30 % of latvia 's population no figures exist on how many foreigners would take advantage of the changes , but analysts expect interest to be highest in former soviet-bloc countries .
no solution latvia 's economy is one of the worst in the eu , with wages shrinking by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2009 and unemployment at nearly 23 percent – the highest in the 27-nation bloc .
those grim figures have led martins kazaks , chief economist at swedbank , to speculate that the law 's overall contribution will be relatively small .
" to attract the investors latvia would need to improve the overall economic environment , " he said .
" one may take a look at this from the point of view that , yes , this may to some extent attract some investors .
but it 's certainly not going to solve the situation that latvia is facing . "

now , housing market analysts in the country are asking themselves the proverbial question : what went wrong ? irish motorists have become all too familiar with the empty , dimly-lit " ghost estates " just off main roads on the outskirts of cities and towns .
there are between 300,000 and 345,000 vacant houses and apartments in a country with only 4.5 million people , according to two recently published university studies .
if those figures are correct , it means some 15 to 17 percent of all dwellings in the country are presently unoccupied .
the typical irish town of saggart , southwest of dublin , is a case in point .
just beyond its historic core with its arched bridge , fountain and ancient church , the new estates begin their outward sprawl .
in some of these , the only signs of life are the occasional toy in a garden , or plant on a balcony .
soaring high in the late stages of ireland 's housing bubble , the market " went stark raving bonkers ” writes fintan o 'toole in his book " ship of fools : how stupidity and corruption sank the celtic tiger . "
by 2006 , construction accounted for 25 percent of economic activity in ireland .
the average house price peaked at just over 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- in early 2007 , reflecting a seemingly insatiable demand for property in a country that has always valued homeownership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for suburban housing is unlikely to improve soon in a seller 's market , it made sense for developers to build speculatively .
the banks also cashed in on the acquisitive frenzy by offering 100 percent mortgages and easing the conditions customers had to meet to qualify for a home loan .
independent economists warned the country was becoming too dependent on construction , but politicians , estate agents and bank economists played down the warnings .
" ireland still has a deficit in infrastructure , " current prime minister and then finance minister brian cowen told the broadcaster rte in july 2006 .
losers and winners the boom petered out in the gathering world recession in early 2008 , affecting the entire sector .
since then tens of thousands of construction professionals have lost their jobs and half of the country 's architects are unemployed .
low demand and market saturation have also caused housing prices to plummet and banks to tighten their purse strings : the number of new mortgages has fallen by 75 percent since the final quarter of 2007 .
ireland has become a land of empty houses .
rob kitchin , who headed the team of researchers from the national university of ireland , predicted that many houses on the ghost estates will be bulldozed , especially those estates in rural northwestern ireland , where demand is unlikely to recover in the next five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians ignored warnings that the housing market was inflated " i think demolition is the last route really , " he told deutsche welle .
" nobody particularly wants to see assets destroyed . "
but while ireland 's poor housing market has hurt many , it has been good news for some .
students , in particular , stand to benefit from the increased availability of quality accommodation , and developers are now willing to rent new apartments to them .
" these are strange times , " said deirdre corcoran , the accommodation officer at dublin institute of technology .
" things have changed dramatically from a situation where we had huge pressure and students were literally getting the dregs , or were n't able to get suitable accommodation . "
what is a home ?
one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .
formerly known as dublin 's " heroin supermarket , " fatima has now been rebuilt after years of consultations with residents .
the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .
the estate 's mix of housing owned by local authorities , private owners and student accommodations has led to a growing consensus that fatima , and similar projects , are examples to follow .
the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

one of the showpiece projects of the economic boom was the regeneration of the once-notorious fatima mansions estate in dublin .

the reconstruction of fatima involved paying close attention to amenities that local residents wanted , like sports facilities and a community center .

the national university of ireland 's kitchin believes irish people need to recover the sense of priority they lost during the boom : " we stopped thinking of houses as homes and started thinking of them as assets or as short-term ventures that would help us get to somewhere else , " he said .
a return to those original priorities , plus more emphasis on better practices in both renewal projects and new construction , could be the useful lessons ireland needs to learn from its ghost houses , he believes .

merkel and juncker discussed the proposed plan to set up a european monetary fund similar to the international monetary fund , intended to help countries deeply in debt get back on track .
merkel stressed , however , that a series of sanctions would first have to considered , to prevent countries from building up their debts in the first place .
she hinted at possible penalties , including the temporary removal of a country 's voting rights in the european council .
both merkel and juncker cautioned that such a fund was not intended for greece .
" this is a plan for the future , " said merkel .
curb trading of credit default swaps also on tuesday , germany and france announced plans to set out proposals to curb or ban financial market speculation , according to a government spokesman in berlin .
merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy will write a joint letter to european commission president jose manuel barroso outlining their proposals .
these include plans to regulate speculation against falling company share prices or loan losses and guards against speculating against the threatened bankruptcies of entire countries , including the trading of credit default swaps .
luxembourg and greece also lent their support for the latter initiative .
" we all agree that we need to prevent financial speculation , " said merkel .

opponents from regional socialist parties also disrupted proceedings in the upper house on monday and again on tuesday . however , the bill that aims to increase the participation of women in politics by reserving 33 percent of seats in parliament and state assemblies , was approved by all the members of the ruling congress-led united progressive alliance , the main opposition bharatiya janata party , four leftist parties and several regional parties . prime minister manmohan singh , who is a member of the upper house , thanked the parties that had supported the bill and expressed his regret about " the abnormal events " that had taken place in the house . before passing into law , the bill has to be approved by the lower house of parliament and india 's state assemblies , where women ’ s quotas will also be introduced . tb / afp / dpa editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's for countries like this one that geothermal energy offers the hope of a cheap , accessible-to-all power supply .
however , electricity from coal-fired plants is still more affordable in indonesia than geothermal electricity . " geothermal energy can contribute significantly to solving the problem of supply deficits , " said thorsten schneider from the german kfw development bank , which supports the construction of a power plant in indonesia 's aceh province .
according to him , geothermal energy 's advantage over solar and wind energy is its reliability and the fact that it is not affected by weather . " as well as this , the geothermal plant would reduce indonesia 's co2 emissions by around 230,000 tons per year , " added schneider . kenya : geothermal energy instead of water energy # b # the risk of earthquakes is higher in places where tectonic plates meet .
but these regions also frequently have the perfect conditions for the utilization of geothermal energy . kenya , which straddles the great rift valley , is a prime example of this .
the country is largely dependent on hydro power , but due to ongoing drought , alternative sources of energy are being sought .
geothermal energy is one possibility .
at the moment , kenya has eight geothermal power plants , including the olkaria power plant in the hell 's gate national park north-west of nairobi . many opportunities , few risks " geothermal energy makes a lot of sense in developing countries that have no nationwide electricity network , " said stefan dietrich .
" geothermal energy 's big advantage compared to ordinary energy sources like nuclear and coal-fired plants is its decentralized organization . " however , despite all the opportunities and eco-friendliness it offers , geothermal energy is not completely risk-free .
there are fears that drilling in geographically delicate regions could trigger earthquakes . " when humans are active underground , there are risks , " said horst kreuter .
" but with geothermal energy , they are very low . " author : nele jensch -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

a tuebingen museum has devoted the first retrospective ever to the californian who says he paints pictures of women , not women . pop art lovers would probably maintain that andy warhol was the artist best known for putting advertising on canvas , but daniel schreiber aims to set the record straight .
schreiber is the managing curator of the " 50 years of pop art " exhibition on show at the kunsthalle tuebingen museum in southern germany .
the show focuses on works by california artist mel ramos - particularly known for his suggestive paintings from the 1960s that combine nude women with commercial products or animals .
in 1967 , an exhibition of his works in a small cologne gallery prompted police to raid the site and cover his works with cloth sheets to " protect the innocent . "
schreiber maintains that ramos helped define 20th century art .
deutsche welle : why did you choose to show mel ramos ' works ?
daniel schreiber : i want to show contemporary art , but i want to show better-known artists , mostly from classical modern art , but now i 'm also trying to show more artists from the post-war period , which is interesting for a broader audience .
i think mel ramos is a good choice for that .
what 's provocative about his works in this day and age ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos reflected trends in advertising we 've had some problems with worried parents who send their kids to a program here where they can make art .
they did n't want them seeing the pictures , but other than that , we 've had a lot of positive feedback .
but in terms of his art , what makes ramos interesting - i would n't say provocative - is that he puts together images from advertising and pin-ups .
that 's usually something that does n't go together .
cigarettes are n't really sexy , car parts are n't normally sexy , or cheese .
but he put it all together and revealed a trend in modern advertising that was developing in the 1960s - of companies sexualizing their products by showing attractive women next to their products .
so what ramos did was to exaggerate this by making the product bigger than it is and display it next to nude women .
this , then , was very provocative at the time , and was also kind of surrealistic .
and it makes for very strong paintings showing tendencies in modern life .
that was provocative in the 1960s , but now , with the internet and all the technology available to us , is that really so new anymore ?
it is ramos 's contribution to 20th-century art , and even that of the 21st century .
he 's never been interested in making provocative art , but his work has been a unique contribution .
what he did was to adapt an age-old subject of art - the nude , which we know from classical times up until today .
and he adapted this subject to modern times .
so he did n't just create " pin-up " paintings ; what he also did was work with art history .
germany has had both a love and hate affair with ramos - at least in the 1960s .
why ?
ramos has said that germany is the country with the greatest number of collectors of his work .
this is no country in the world with so many museums and art schools as germany .
so this is the " love " part .
also , in the 1960s , the artist was presenting the american way of life , and this was appealing to the new post-war generation that was trying to rebuild germany .
but there was also a counter-movement which was more conservative , in the restoration period with konrad adenauer -lsb- chancellor from 1949-1963 -rsb- at the helm , when people tried to create a more " moral " society .
there was a law for the protection of young people , and by law it was forbidden to show nude pictures in public spaces .
so , there was an exhibition in a small gallery in cologne in 1967 , and the police went in and covered ramos 's paintings with sheets .
but there are plenty of paintings in museums that show nudes - that 's a classic subject of art , as you said yourself .
what 's the difference ?
what ramos did is that he freshened it up , and this is exactly what he wanted to do .
when edouard manet painted his " luncheon on the grass " in the 19th century , it was a scandal , but it 's no longer a scandal today .
ramos has used the same tactic .
what he once said was that he works like a restorer - he removes the layer of grime on the canvas of a painting , and freshens up the motifs , once again revealing their provocative content .
in the 19th century , painters such as manet , for example , could shock viewers , and ramos did the same in the 20th century .
ramos hit a nerve back then .
when art triggers such a response , it has obviously hit a nerve .
has ramos 's work been considered high or low art ?
there were exhibitions in small galleries in the 1960s , and the first one in a very small museum exhibition was in aachen in 1969 .
there have been a few exhibitions in museums since then , but only minor ones .
this one in tuebingen is the first retrospective ever .
ramos was always a collectors ' artist , a bit outside the mainstream .
even today , art historians have trouble recognizing him as a great artist , and i think this has to do with his subject matter - because he cites advertising and he 's worked with pin-ups , and he still has the image of making " dirty " art .
but i think this is the right time to devote such a large exhibition to him in our museum - and it will go on tour , to munich and vienna and paris .
bildunterschrift : exaggerating the size of the product added to ramos 's statement in the end , ramos is still showing women as objects in his paintings ; that really has n't changed , has it ?
is that not still problematic ?
yes , it does still do that , and that is the point .
he shows what people do with advertising .
his point is not to show them as objects , but to show how women are shown or used as objects in advertising .
he said once that he never paints women ; he always paints pictures of women .
that 's the difference .
does he really want to objectify women in his work , or does he merely reflect trends in advertising ?
that is the question .
what he does is make these trends tangible through his works , and brings them into the art world and makes it possible to recognize them and offer them up for debate .
in your opinion , have germans been more accepting of ramos 's works than americans ?
after all , germans are less prudish when it comes to nudity … i think mel ramos is a central pop art artist and he 's one of the last ones alive .
his contribution to art is that he saved the nude as a subject in 20th-century painting .
in the united states , los angeles anyway , one can live a pretty hermetic life as an artist .
in germany , people like him are revered as pop stars .
as far as museums go , he 's received recognition in the us .
his work is in many more larger museum collections there than here in germany , even though his fan base is in this country .
the exhibition in the kunsthalle tuebingen runs through april 25 , 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 09.03.2010 germany debates extending the statute of limitations for sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the reported abuse cases happened too long ago as more and more allegations of sexual abuse in catholic institutions come to light , german politicians debate whether to extend the statute of limitations for civil and criminal prosecution . a rash of reported cases of sexual abuse and molestation in schools and other institutions run by the catholic church in germany has led to a discussion about whether the country 's time limit on civil and criminal prosecution of abuse cases should be raised .
most of the alleged abuse now being reported occurred decades ago .
experts say it often takes years for victims to gather the courage to come forward and deal with what happened to them .
german law allows for criminal prosecution only within 10 years of the alleged victim turning 18 .
the statute of limitations for pursuing financial compensation through a civil suit is three years .
" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .

" clearly too short " members of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as well as coalition partners the free democrats , are calling for extending the amount of time when an alleged victim can sue for punitive damages and for pain and suffering .
they argue that victims should be able to sue until up to 20-30 years after the crime occurred .
" we see a need for action in civil law as well as in criminal law , " said the free democrats ' parliamentary spokesman for national justice issues , max stadler .
" the regular statute of limitations of three years for collection of punitive damages and compensation for pain and suffering is clearly too short . "
some in the church are echoing the call for an extended limit , including bamberg archbishop ludwig schick , who said he supported raising the limit to 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger is against changing the statute of limitations but germany 's justice minister , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , said that the priority should be on investigating cases more promptly , rather than extending the statute of limitations .
" i think it 's best if the appropriate authorities are informed as soon as there is any suspiscion or evidence of sexual abuse , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger told deutsche welle .
" then the incident can be investigated quickly .
only then can you really establish what happened .
after 30 years that 's very difficult . "
green party chief renate kuenast said her party was also against raising the statute of limitations .
" this debate is a distraction from what 's really important right now , which is the investigation into what happened , " kuenast told the neue westfaelische newspaper on tuesday .
a round table for truth and reconciliation ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger wants a round table of church leaders , government officials , doctors , teachers , and local representatives to meet on april 23 .
the goal will be to discuss how to prevent sexual abuse and to establish a code of conduct for public institutions .
the meeting could also talk about how to compensate abuse victims .
munich archbishop reinhard marx has said he would welcome such a discussion .
but in an interview with the news agency kna , he cautioned against holding churches and their employees under suspiscion without proof .
pope 's brother says sexual abuse was " not discussed " meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's elder brother , georg ratzinger , told the passauer neue presse daily newspaper that alleged sexual abuse at the boys ' choir school where he worked from 1964 to 1993 was " never discussed . "
" things like this were never discussed ...
at the beginning of my time there were a lot of problems with the reorganization of the choir , which were the main focus of interest , " ratzinger said in an interview on tuesday .
the brother of the german-born pope directed the domspatzen choir to which the school was attached .

there are over a million migrant workers in thailand , many from myanmar , also known as burma . police units in thailand ’ s border towns and provinces are reportedly gearing up to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant workers .
the national verification process deadline was up at the end of february , and although some 700,000 migrants were able to obtain the documents that the authorities now require – a so-called proof of origin – 500,000 were not . however , for many of the migrant workers in thailand , it is almost impossible to go home , says sunai pasuk from human rights watch . " the burmese represent the largest percentage of migrant workers in thailand .
it is more difficult for them to go back home to go through the national verification process because they fear for their safety at the hands of the military government in burma .
they fear that they will be subjected to extortion at the hands of the burmese authorities .
and they fear that if they go back to burma their families could be taxed heavily because the burmese authorities see them as making a sizeable income in thailand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 2008 , 54 burmese migrant workers were found dead in a truck in thailand exploited as domestic helps or textile workers most of the migrant workers in thailand work as domestic helps or as textile workers .
they are often exploited and rarely receive the minimum wage , says jackie pollock , the head of an ngo for migrant workers in chiang mai . " migrants on a daily basis are exploited in their workplace .
the labor laws are really not enforced although the ministry of labor says all workers are entitled to minimum wage and protection , which the migrant workers rarely receive . " they are also liable to extortion by the police if they are undocumented .
at any point of the day a policeman can approach them and take money from them – even from migrants who are documented , who have the migrant worker ’ s card , because usually the employer confiscates it . " women are at particular risk sunai pasuk from human rights watch says that there is so much abuse against migrant workers because “ they exist only as an asset in the investment calculation .
there is no protection . " they can be killed for failing to pay the protection fee to human trafficking networks or to corrupt officials .
female migrant workers if they are arrested can be subjected to rape or sexual abuse in exchange for their release . " yet , migrant workers from myanmar , laos and cambodia form a substantial part of the thai economy .
many companies fear they will have to close down if workers without papers are deported , especially considering the current economic crisis . un call for more rights for migrant workers last year , the united nations called on the international community to fortify the rights of migrant workers .
helen clark , the new head of the un development program , presented a report exposing prejudices and myths . " during the international recession , as unemployment has risen , some countries have unfortunately witnessed a backlash against migrants and in those circumstances the political debate around migration can become rather negative , " she explained . " a very important dimension of this year ’ s report is that it challenges many of the stereotypes , which bedevil the debate around migration .
this report suggests that fears about migrants taking jobs or lowering the wages of local people , placing an unwelcome burden on local services or costing taxpayers ’ money are generally exaggerated .
the report asserts , rather , that receiving societies as a whole benefit from migrants , from the rising levels of technical innovation they may bring all the way through to the building of increasingly diverse cultures . " many thai ngos have called on the government not to deport illegal migrant workers , saying that they risk falling prey to human rights violations and extreme poverty in their countries of origin . author : bernd musch-borowska / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
