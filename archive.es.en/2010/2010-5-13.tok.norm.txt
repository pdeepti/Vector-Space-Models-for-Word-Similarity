" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 13.05.2010 discount giant takes over woolworth germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woolworth germany currently has 4,300 employees just 13 months ago , german retail chain woolworth was bankrupt .
now an insolvency administrator has made the company profitable again , woolworth is being bought by a major discount group with ambitious expansion plans . just over a year after german discounter woolworth filed for bankruptcy , the retail chain has returned to profitability and found a new investor .
woolworth is being sold to north rhine-westphalia-based hh holding , a subsidiary of the tengelmann retail group , which plans to expand the brand 's network of 162 stores to 500 outlets within a few years , and eventually to 1,000 .
the sale saves some 4,300 jobs , at least for a year .
hh holding was put forward by new york-based cerberus capital management , which leases the commercial space for 82 woolworth stores and strong-armed the company 's insolvency administrator into rejecting three rival bidders .
return to profits insolvency administrator ottmar hermann said he expects woolworth 's gross income to reach 500 million euros -lrb- $ 634 million -rrb- this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hermann restructured woolworth to make the chain profitable again the company 's return to profitability was achieved by selling or closing 150 smaller outlets , each approximately 400 to 450 square meters -lrb- 4,300 to 4,800 square feet -rrb- in size with an average of 10 employees .
the stores which were kept are 900 to 1600 square meters in size and employ 25 to 30 people each .
the purchase price was not disclosed .
woolworth has been in business in germany since 1926 , and was once part of the us-based department store chain woolworths .
that company went out of business in 1997 , while the british chain folded at the beginning of 2009 .
cooperation with kik pietro nuvoloni , a spokesman for hermann , described woolworth as iconic .
" we find ourselves in an extremely difficult market environment , and this was an act of strength for the insolvency administrator , " he said .
woolworth 's new owners are uniquely positioned to expand the chain because they also own clothing discounter kik .
the textile discounter has nearly 3,000 stores and a network of direct contacts with clothing manufacturers in asia , according to nuvoloni .
although nuvoloni said the new owners are committed to maintaining woolworth as an independent brand , the chain 's central office in frankfurt is being closed .
a new office will be opened in the north rhine-westphalian city of bohnen , where kik is headquartered .
" the buyers have made clear the woolworth brand will remain in existence , that it will be further developed , and that significant growth is expected through the woolworth brand , " nuvoloni said .
labor practices criticized while woolworth and kik both advertise textiles and other items at rock-bottom prices , enthusiasm for the chains is far from universal .
critics say they underpay workers , while kik has been embroiled in controversy because of the allegedly unethical practices of its suppliers in asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kik 's asian clothing suppliers have been criticized over low labor standards cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the services trade union verdi , said woolworth pays its full-time employees up to 200 euros less than the monthly standard for the sector .
the company also relies heavily on part-time workers to further reduce its costs , she said .
" this does not open any kind of perspective of the future for employees .
the fact that the current contracts will be limited to one year certainly does not inspire much confidence , " hass said .
" we have a lot of experience in dealing with the mergers of commercial enterprises , and thus far it has always led to chaos . "
while hass acknowledged the rescue of 4,300 jobs is a good thing , she said she expects hh holding will attempt to staff its rapid expansion using more part-time workers .
" we would actually expect compensation to be improved , and that a company with a future would endorse a wage agreement , " she said .
the sale was registered with germany 's federal cartel authority wednesday and should be approved within a month , barring complications , according to a government spokesperson .

but recent sex abuse scandals are looming large . hundreds of thousands of christians of all denominations have begun descending on the bavarian capital , munich , for what is the biggest gathering of its type in europe .
around 3,000 social , religious and political events are planned for the christian kirchentag , or church day congress , which , in addition to catholics and protestants , will also see members of the various orthodox churches attend .
but despite the efforts of the various churches to keep the focus on ecumenism at the five-day gathering , a series of ongoing clerical sexual abuse scandals has weighed heavily on the event .
the catholic church has faced a wave of sex abuse allegations across ireland , germany , austria , poland and the netherlands in recent months .
so far more than 150 cases of sexual abuse in catholic institutions in germany alone have been reported , some dating back to the 1950s .
the matter is to be addressed in a series of meetings at the munich congress in an effort by christian authorities to avoid being seen as dodging the issue .
alois glueck , a german politician and leader of the catholic side of the kirchentag , said trust in the church had been shattered by the scandal revelations and that focus must now shift to the victims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands will attend the congress in his greeting to the munich gathering , pope benedict xvi , who is currently in portugal , called on christians not to turn away from the church despite the latest scandals , saying the church remained a place of hope .
german president horst koehler meanwhile alluded to the many challenges facing christian leaders at the congress .
" a failure in leadership , abuse , maltreatment - all of these things have led to a serious crisis , " he said in his opening remarks .
" clarification and attention to the victims is the order of the day , but also the view ahead , the will for self-reflection and change . " dfm / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .
the 16 federal states are responsible for monitoring the facilities .
that justified the need for consent , the experts said. sac / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .
the 16 federal states are responsible for monitoring the facilities .
that justified the need for consent , the experts said. sac / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 13.05.2010 france 's pompidou-metz brings parisian art to the province großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pompidou center in paris celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007 outspoken architecture and works by major artists often suffice to set a museum in good stead .
but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .
the 16 federal states are responsible for monitoring the facilities .
that justified the need for consent , the experts said. sac / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans disasters -pipe- 13.05.2010 oil executives pass the blame for us gulf spill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive oil slick has hit us shores top oil executives testifying in washington this week on the oil spill in the gulf of mexico all agree on one thing - someone else is to blame for the oil rig explosion that has sparked a major environmental disaster . leading oil executives avoided taking full responsibility for the oil spill in the gulf of mexico as congressional hearings got underway this week in washington . " i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

but recent sex abuse scandals are looming large . hundreds of thousands of christians of all denominations have begun descending on the bavarian capital , munich , for what is the biggest gathering of its type in europe .
around 3,000 social , religious and political events are planned for the christian kirchentag , or church day congress , which , in addition to catholics and protestants , will also see members of the various orthodox churches attend .
but despite the efforts of the various churches to keep the focus on ecumenism at the five-day gathering , a series of ongoing clerical sexual abuse scandals has weighed heavily on the event .
the catholic church has faced a wave of sex abuse allegations across ireland , germany , austria , poland and the netherlands in recent months .
so far more than 150 cases of sexual abuse in catholic institutions in germany alone have been reported , some dating back to the 1950s .
the matter is to be addressed in a series of meetings at the munich congress in an effort by christian authorities to avoid being seen as dodging the issue .
alois glueck , a german politician and leader of the catholic side of the kirchentag , said trust in the church had been shattered by the scandal revelations and that focus must now shift to the victims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands will attend the congress in his greeting to the munich gathering , pope benedict xvi , who is currently in portugal , called on christians not to turn away from the church despite the latest scandals , saying the church remained a place of hope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 13.05.2010 france 's pompidou-metz brings parisian art to the province großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pompidou center in paris celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007 outspoken architecture and works by major artists often suffice to set a museum in good stead .
but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .
he says today , people have forgotten about china 's role in the 70s .
" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .
and is heavily engaged in developing infrastructure , particularly bridges and highways .
so i think there has been a radical transformation when it comes to bangladesh and china 's relationship in the last 30 to 35 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electronics are cheap and popular , especially mp3 players tousia islam is a student at dhaka university and she is a great fan of china .
she thinks china has a lot to offer bangladeshi people .
she says , " chinese food is so popular here .
the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese food has become popular in bangladesh china 's image " very positive " the chinese have not only impressed the people of bangladesh with their food and culture , but also with their advancements in science and technology .
young bangladeshis want to learn from the middle kingdom and gain the same technical know-how .
journalist arif mahmud says these are the reasons china is welcome : " china has developed in science and technology in the world and especially in the asia-pacific region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshis are impressed with china 's technical know-how china and bangladesh have come a long way since the 1970s .
now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 13.05.2010 france 's pompidou-metz brings parisian art to the province großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pompidou center in paris celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007 outspoken architecture and works by major artists often suffice to set a museum in good stead .
but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .
the 16 federal states are responsible for monitoring the facilities .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .
he says today , people have forgotten about china 's role in the 70s .
" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .
and is heavily engaged in developing infrastructure , particularly bridges and highways .
so i think there has been a radical transformation when it comes to bangladesh and china 's relationship in the last 30 to 35 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electronics are cheap and popular , especially mp3 players tousia islam is a student at dhaka university and she is a great fan of china .
she thinks china has a lot to offer bangladeshi people .
she says , " chinese food is so popular here .
the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese food has become popular in bangladesh china 's image " very positive " the chinese have not only impressed the people of bangladesh with their food and culture , but also with their advancements in science and technology .
young bangladeshis want to learn from the middle kingdom and gain the same technical know-how .
journalist arif mahmud says these are the reasons china is welcome : " china has developed in science and technology in the world and especially in the asia-pacific region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshis are impressed with china 's technical know-how china and bangladesh have come a long way since the 1970s .
now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "
the bangladesh government seems keen to avoid tensions with china .
last year , a photo exhibition on tibet in dhaka was closed by the authorities after complaints by the chinese embassy .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "

polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .

since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .

nearly 400,000 worshippers attended a mass at the shrine of fatima . nearly half a million people flocked to hear pope benedict xvi celebrate a mass at the shrine of fatima in portugal , one of christianity 's holiest sites .
many of the worshippers had camped out overnight to attend the two-hour ceremony . the overwhelming support was evidence of church 's continued influence despite the sex abuse scandal , said vatican spokesman federico lombardi . " what 's happened in the last few months , with the problems of the abuse scandal , could lead one to think that the attention and energy towards the pope has been weakened , but that has not happened , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mass marked the 93rd anniversary of reported appearances of the virgin mary to shepherd children gay marraige ' threat ' in his speech , the 83-year-old german-born pontiff criticized gay marriage and abortion as " insidious and dangerous threats to the common good . "
portugal is set to legalize gay marriage next week , just three years after the deeply catholic country decriminalized abortion .
the mass at fatima was considered by many to be the highlight of the pope 's visit to portugal , which began in lisbon on tuesday and is to end in porto on friday. smh / afp / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .
he says today , people have forgotten about china 's role in the 70s .
" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .
and is heavily engaged in developing infrastructure , particularly bridges and highways .
so i think there has been a radical transformation when it comes to bangladesh and china 's relationship in the last 30 to 35 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electronics are cheap and popular , especially mp3 players tousia islam is a student at dhaka university and she is a great fan of china .
she thinks china has a lot to offer bangladeshi people .
she says , " chinese food is so popular here .
the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese food has become popular in bangladesh china 's image " very positive " the chinese have not only impressed the people of bangladesh with their food and culture , but also with their advancements in science and technology .
young bangladeshis want to learn from the middle kingdom and gain the same technical know-how .
journalist arif mahmud says these are the reasons china is welcome : " china has developed in science and technology in the world and especially in the asia-pacific region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshis are impressed with china 's technical know-how china and bangladesh have come a long way since the 1970s .
now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "
the bangladesh government seems keen to avoid tensions with china .
last year , a photo exhibition on tibet in dhaka was closed by the authorities after complaints by the chinese embassy .

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .
he says today , people have forgotten about china 's role in the 70s .
" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .
and is heavily engaged in developing infrastructure , particularly bridges and highways .
so i think there has been a radical transformation when it comes to bangladesh and china 's relationship in the last 30 to 35 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electronics are cheap and popular , especially mp3 players tousia islam is a student at dhaka university and she is a great fan of china .
she thinks china has a lot to offer bangladeshi people .
she says , " chinese food is so popular here .
the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese food has become popular in bangladesh china 's image " very positive " the chinese have not only impressed the people of bangladesh with their food and culture , but also with their advancements in science and technology .
young bangladeshis want to learn from the middle kingdom and gain the same technical know-how .
journalist arif mahmud says these are the reasons china is welcome : " china has developed in science and technology in the world and especially in the asia-pacific region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshis are impressed with china 's technical know-how china and bangladesh have come a long way since the 1970s .
now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "
the bangladesh government seems keen to avoid tensions with china .
last year , a photo exhibition on tibet in dhaka was closed by the authorities after complaints by the chinese embassy .

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 13.05.2010 discount giant takes over woolworth germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woolworth germany currently has 4,300 employees just 13 months ago , german retail chain woolworth was bankrupt .
now an insolvency administrator has made the company profitable again , woolworth is being bought by a major discount group with ambitious expansion plans . just over a year after german discounter woolworth filed for bankruptcy , the retail chain has returned to profitability and found a new investor .
woolworth is being sold to north rhine-westphalia-based hh holding , a subsidiary of the tengelmann retail group , which plans to expand the brand 's network of 162 stores to 500 outlets within a few years , and eventually to 1,000 .
the sale saves some 4,300 jobs , at least for a year .
hh holding was put forward by new york-based cerberus capital management , which leases the commercial space for 82 woolworth stores and strong-armed the company 's insolvency administrator into rejecting three rival bidders .
return to profits insolvency administrator ottmar hermann said he expects woolworth 's gross income to reach 500 million euros -lrb- $ 634 million -rrb- this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ottmar hermann restructured woolworth to make the chain profitable again the company 's return to profitability was achieved by selling or closing 150 smaller outlets , each approximately 400 to 450 square meters -lrb- 4,300 to 4,800 square feet -rrb- in size with an average of 10 employees .
the stores which were kept are 900 to 1600 square meters in size and employ 25 to 30 people each .
the purchase price was not disclosed .
woolworth has been in business in germany since 1926 , and was once part of the us-based department store chain woolworths .
that company went out of business in 1997 , while the british chain folded at the beginning of 2009 .
cooperation with kik pietro nuvoloni , a spokesman for hermann , described woolworth as iconic .
" we find ourselves in an extremely difficult market environment , and this was an act of strength for the insolvency administrator , " he said .
woolworth 's new owners are uniquely positioned to expand the chain because they also own clothing discounter kik .
the textile discounter has nearly 3,000 stores and a network of direct contacts with clothing manufacturers in asia , according to nuvoloni .
although nuvoloni said the new owners are committed to maintaining woolworth as an independent brand , the chain 's central office in frankfurt is being closed .
a new office will be opened in the north rhine-westphalian city of bohnen , where kik is headquartered .
" the buyers have made clear the woolworth brand will remain in existence , that it will be further developed , and that significant growth is expected through the woolworth brand , " nuvoloni said .
labor practices criticized while woolworth and kik both advertise textiles and other items at rock-bottom prices , enthusiasm for the chains is far from universal .
critics say they underpay workers , while kik has been embroiled in controversy because of the allegedly unethical practices of its suppliers in asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kik 's asian clothing suppliers have been criticized over low labor standards cornelia hass , a spokeswoman for the services trade union verdi , said woolworth pays its full-time employees up to 200 euros less than the monthly standard for the sector .
the company also relies heavily on part-time workers to further reduce its costs , she said .
" this does not open any kind of perspective of the future for employees .
the fact that the current contracts will be limited to one year certainly does not inspire much confidence , " hass said .
" we have a lot of experience in dealing with the mergers of commercial enterprises , and thus far it has always led to chaos . "
while hass acknowledged the rescue of 4,300 jobs is a good thing , she said she expects hh holding will attempt to staff its rapid expansion using more part-time workers .
" we would actually expect compensation to be improved , and that a company with a future would endorse a wage agreement , " she said .
the sale was registered with germany 's federal cartel authority wednesday and should be approved within a month , barring complications , according to a government spokesperson .

new york 's attorney general has begun investigating eight banks , including deutsche bank , on their relationships with ratings agencies . new york attorney general andrew cuomo is investigating whether eight banks misled ratings agencies to inflate the grades of certain mortgage securities , reports in the us media said thursday .
late wednesday , the attorney general 's office notified the banks of the investigation , according to a report on the new york times website .
part of a larger securities probe the investigation is part of a larger probe by us authorities questioning the business practices of a range of financial firms whose clients bought mortgage securities in the years leading to the collapse of the housing market in 2008 .
at the heart of that collapse - which triggered the global financial meltdown - is a question of whether or not ratings agencies inflated the debt ratings on mortgage securities that were the foundation of complex and far-reaching investment vehicles .
the inquiry suggests cuomo thinks the agencies may have been tricked by one or more of the targets of his probe , media reports said .
in addition to deutsche bank , those targets include goldman sachs , morgan stanley , ubs , citigroup , credit suisse , credit agricole and merrill lynch , which is now owned by bank of america .
cuomo 's office is reportedly working with together with the securities and exchange commission in the preliminary criminal probe .
lawmakers want aggressive action standard & poor 's , fitch ratings and moody 's investors service were the companies that rated the mortgage deals , the report said .
the agencies have taken flack for overstating the quality of mortgage securities that later lost value in the wake of the housing collapse .
lawmakers are urging prosecutors to be more aggressive in their investigation of the financial crisis .
the latest investigation remains in its preliminary stages , a report in the wall street journal noted , with prosecutors gathering evidence and not yet issuing any criminal subpoenas. jen / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .

but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de awards -pipe- 13.05.2010 tusk sings eu 's praises as he accepts charlemagne prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk receives the prize in its 60th year polish prime minister donald tusk is this year 's winner of the charlemagne prize .
the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans disasters -pipe- 13.05.2010 oil executives pass the blame for us gulf spill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive oil slick has hit us shores top oil executives testifying in washington this week on the oil spill in the gulf of mexico all agree on one thing - someone else is to blame for the oil rig explosion that has sparked a major environmental disaster . leading oil executives avoided taking full responsibility for the oil spill in the gulf of mexico as congressional hearings got underway this week in washington . " i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

but recent sex abuse scandals are looming large . hundreds of thousands of christians of all denominations have begun descending on the bavarian capital , munich , for what is the biggest gathering of its type in europe .
around 3,000 social , religious and political events are planned for the christian kirchentag , or church day congress , which , in addition to catholics and protestants , will also see members of the various orthodox churches attend .
but despite the efforts of the various churches to keep the focus on ecumenism at the five-day gathering , a series of ongoing clerical sexual abuse scandals has weighed heavily on the event .
the catholic church has faced a wave of sex abuse allegations across ireland , germany , austria , poland and the netherlands in recent months .
so far more than 150 cases of sexual abuse in catholic institutions in germany alone have been reported , some dating back to the 1950s .
the matter is to be addressed in a series of meetings at the munich congress in an effort by christian authorities to avoid being seen as dodging the issue .
alois glueck , a german politician and leader of the catholic side of the kirchentag , said trust in the church had been shattered by the scandal revelations and that focus must now shift to the victims .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .
he says today , people have forgotten about china 's role in the 70s .
" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .
and is heavily engaged in developing infrastructure , particularly bridges and highways .
so i think there has been a radical transformation when it comes to bangladesh and china 's relationship in the last 30 to 35 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electronics are cheap and popular , especially mp3 players tousia islam is a student at dhaka university and she is a great fan of china .
she thinks china has a lot to offer bangladeshi people .
she says , " chinese food is so popular here .
the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese food has become popular in bangladesh china 's image " very positive " the chinese have not only impressed the people of bangladesh with their food and culture , but also with their advancements in science and technology .
young bangladeshis want to learn from the middle kingdom and gain the same technical know-how .
journalist arif mahmud says these are the reasons china is welcome : " china has developed in science and technology in the world and especially in the asia-pacific region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshis are impressed with china 's technical know-how china and bangladesh have come a long way since the 1970s .
now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "
the bangladesh government seems keen to avoid tensions with china .
last year , a photo exhibition on tibet in dhaka was closed by the authorities after complaints by the chinese embassy .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

the ministry of public security ’ s statement came following wednesday 's attack in northern china that killed nine people including seven children .
china has witnessed a series of attacks on children in the past two months that have left 18 students dead . china 's public security minister meng jianzhu has promised to crack down on anyone caught attacking teachers , students or children .

over a dozen children were injured in the incident , which ended with the attacker committing suicide .
this incident has shocked many across the country .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .

" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .

the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .

shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland mourned the deaths of kaczynski and 95 others in the plane crash low-key celebrations tusk was presented with the charlemagne prize for his role as a " patriot and great european . "
during the award ceremony , the 53-year-old was lauded as an outstanding proponent of freedom , democracy and human rights , who never yielded to the communist regime in poland .
proceedings in aachen also focused on the tragic plane crash in russia last month that killed 96 people , including polish president lech kaczynski and his wife .
tusk dedicated his award to their memory .
in his speech , he also accepted the award in honor of the so-called " solidarnosc generation , " a reference to the 1980s trade union movement instrumental in the downfall of communism in the country. mh / dfm / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .
he says today , people have forgotten about china 's role in the 70s .
" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .
and is heavily engaged in developing infrastructure , particularly bridges and highways .
so i think there has been a radical transformation when it comes to bangladesh and china 's relationship in the last 30 to 35 years . "

the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "

now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "
the bangladesh government seems keen to avoid tensions with china .

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .

but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 13.05.2010 france 's pompidou-metz brings parisian art to the province großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pompidou center in paris celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007 outspoken architecture and works by major artists often suffice to set a museum in good stead .
but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .
the 16 federal states are responsible for monitoring the facilities .
that justified the need for consent , the experts said. sac / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "

the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .

de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .
the 16 federal states are responsible for monitoring the facilities .
that justified the need for consent , the experts said. sac / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans disasters -pipe- 13.05.2010 oil executives pass the blame for us gulf spill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive oil slick has hit us shores top oil executives testifying in washington this week on the oil spill in the gulf of mexico all agree on one thing - someone else is to blame for the oil rig explosion that has sparked a major environmental disaster . leading oil executives avoided taking full responsibility for the oil spill in the gulf of mexico as congressional hearings got underway this week in washington . " i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

but recent sex abuse scandals are looming large . hundreds of thousands of christians of all denominations have begun descending on the bavarian capital , munich , for what is the biggest gathering of its type in europe .
around 3,000 social , religious and political events are planned for the christian kirchentag , or church day congress , which , in addition to catholics and protestants , will also see members of the various orthodox churches attend .
but despite the efforts of the various churches to keep the focus on ecumenism at the five-day gathering , a series of ongoing clerical sexual abuse scandals has weighed heavily on the event .
the catholic church has faced a wave of sex abuse allegations across ireland , germany , austria , poland and the netherlands in recent months .
so far more than 150 cases of sexual abuse in catholic institutions in germany alone have been reported , some dating back to the 1950s .
the matter is to be addressed in a series of meetings at the munich congress in an effort by christian authorities to avoid being seen as dodging the issue .
alois glueck , a german politician and leader of the catholic side of the kirchentag , said trust in the church had been shattered by the scandal revelations and that focus must now shift to the victims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands will attend the congress in his greeting to the munich gathering , pope benedict xvi , who is currently in portugal , called on christians not to turn away from the church despite the latest scandals , saying the church remained a place of hope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 13.05.2010 france 's pompidou-metz brings parisian art to the province großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pompidou center in paris celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007 outspoken architecture and works by major artists often suffice to set a museum in good stead .
but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

new york 's attorney general has begun investigating eight banks , including deutsche bank , on their relationships with ratings agencies . new york attorney general andrew cuomo is investigating whether eight banks misled ratings agencies to inflate the grades of certain mortgage securities , reports in the us media said thursday .
late wednesday , the attorney general 's office notified the banks of the investigation , according to a report on the new york times website .
part of a larger securities probe the investigation is part of a larger probe by us authorities questioning the business practices of a range of financial firms whose clients bought mortgage securities in the years leading to the collapse of the housing market in 2008 .
at the heart of that collapse - which triggered the global financial meltdown - is a question of whether or not ratings agencies inflated the debt ratings on mortgage securities that were the foundation of complex and far-reaching investment vehicles .
the inquiry suggests cuomo thinks the agencies may have been tricked by one or more of the targets of his probe , media reports said .
in addition to deutsche bank , those targets include goldman sachs , morgan stanley , ubs , citigroup , credit suisse , credit agricole and merrill lynch , which is now owned by bank of america .
cuomo 's office is reportedly working with together with the securities and exchange commission in the preliminary criminal probe .
lawmakers want aggressive action standard & poor 's , fitch ratings and moody 's investors service were the companies that rated the mortgage deals , the report said .
the agencies have taken flack for overstating the quality of mortgage securities that later lost value in the wake of the housing collapse .
lawmakers are urging prosecutors to be more aggressive in their investigation of the financial crisis .
the latest investigation remains in its preliminary stages , a report in the wall street journal noted , with prosecutors gathering evidence and not yet issuing any criminal subpoenas. jen / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .

" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .

that limits the chancellor 's ability to extend the lifespan of nuclear-power plants .
merkel has said she favored extended use of the plants to meet energy demands in the european union 's largest power user .
proponents say longer use of nuclear power would also cut greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
germany 's 17 nuclear reactors accounted for an estimated 23 percent of the country ’ s power generation last year , while coal and natural gas made up a combined 55 percent .
merkel 's center-right coalition had intended to revoke a law passed under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left coalition that foresaw shutting down all nuclear power plants in germany by around 2020 .
using leeway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitter defeat - merkel with conservative premier juergen ruettgers who lost the election legal experts are now debating whether merkel 's plans can still be pushed through without the approval of parliament 's upper chamber , the bundesrat .
but the state premier of hesse roland koch has called on the government to implement the plans without bundesrat approval .
" we do n't have to give up plans to extend the operating lives of nuclear reactors , " koch told the daily hamburger abendblatt newspaper on wednesday .
he said that the nuclear phase-out law had , after all , come into force under schroeder 's government without upper house approval .
schroder 's coalition had at the time argued that the legislation unburdened the states and therefore did not require approval .
" the federal government would be well advised to use its room to maneuver , " koch said .
higher costs justify approval but legal experts in parliament have concluded that the bundesrat must be asked to vote on the legislation .
" an amendment is needed to extend the life-span or rather reintroduce the long-lasting use of nuclear energy , which requires approval by the bundesrat , " according to a a report by the parliament 's research services quoted by german news agencies .
if the plants continued operating , germany 's states would have to carry the cost .
the 16 federal states are responsible for monitoring the facilities .
that justified the need for consent , the experts said. sac / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .

the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "

young bangladeshis want to learn from the middle kingdom and gain the same technical know-how .

now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "
the bangladesh government seems keen to avoid tensions with china .
last year , a photo exhibition on tibet in dhaka was closed by the authorities after complaints by the chinese embassy .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .
he says today , people have forgotten about china 's role in the 70s .
" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .
and is heavily engaged in developing infrastructure , particularly bridges and highways .
so i think there has been a radical transformation when it comes to bangladesh and china 's relationship in the last 30 to 35 years . "

she thinks china has a lot to offer bangladeshi people .

the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "

journalist arif mahmud says these are the reasons china is welcome : " china has developed in science and technology in the world and especially in the asia-pacific region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshis are impressed with china 's technical know-how china and bangladesh have come a long way since the 1970s .
now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "
the bangladesh government seems keen to avoid tensions with china .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

proceedings in aachen also focused on the tragic plane crash in russia last month that killed 96 people , including polish president lech kaczynski and his wife .
tusk dedicated his award to their memory .

new york 's attorney general has begun investigating eight banks , including deutsche bank , on their relationships with ratings agencies . new york attorney general andrew cuomo is investigating whether eight banks misled ratings agencies to inflate the grades of certain mortgage securities , reports in the us media said thursday .
late wednesday , the attorney general 's office notified the banks of the investigation , according to a report on the new york times website .
part of a larger securities probe the investigation is part of a larger probe by us authorities questioning the business practices of a range of financial firms whose clients bought mortgage securities in the years leading to the collapse of the housing market in 2008 .
at the heart of that collapse - which triggered the global financial meltdown - is a question of whether or not ratings agencies inflated the debt ratings on mortgage securities that were the foundation of complex and far-reaching investment vehicles .
the inquiry suggests cuomo thinks the agencies may have been tricked by one or more of the targets of his probe , media reports said .
in addition to deutsche bank , those targets include goldman sachs , morgan stanley , ubs , citigroup , credit suisse , credit agricole and merrill lynch , which is now owned by bank of america .
cuomo 's office is reportedly working with together with the securities and exchange commission in the preliminary criminal probe .
lawmakers want aggressive action standard & poor 's , fitch ratings and moody 's investors service were the companies that rated the mortgage deals , the report said .
the agencies have taken flack for overstating the quality of mortgage securities that later lost value in the wake of the housing collapse .
lawmakers are urging prosecutors to be more aggressive in their investigation of the financial crisis .
the latest investigation remains in its preliminary stages , a report in the wall street journal noted , with prosecutors gathering evidence and not yet issuing any criminal subpoenas. jen / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes a day after spain announced its own budget cuts , triggering protests from trade unions . portugal has become the latest country to introduce austerity measures , after both greece and spain took similar steps to stabilize public finances in the face of massive debt .
portuguese prime minister jose socrates announced spending cuts to slash the 2011 target budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , down from a previous estimate of 5.1 percent .
" these measures are crucial to re-establishing confidence and secure financing for the country , " socrates said at a news conference in lisbon .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

proceedings in aachen also focused on the tragic plane crash in russia last month that killed 96 people , including polish president lech kaczynski and his wife .
tusk dedicated his award to their memory .
in his speech , he also accepted the award in honor of the so-called " solidarnosc generation , " a reference to the 1980s trade union movement instrumental in the downfall of communism in the country. mh / dfm / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .
previous winners of the charlemagne prize have included chancellor angela merkel in 2008 and former us president bill clinton in 2000 . author : bartosz dudek / marcin antosiewicz -lrb- cb / jen -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .
he comes across as a thoughtful politician who does n't look for a fight . his conciliatory tone makes him one of the most popular politicians in poland .
it also serves him well in brussels .
since 2007 , poland has once again become a welcome and constructive partner country .
despite his quiet nature , tusk was a vocal advocate of the ratification of the eu 's lisbon treaty .

the prestigious european prize is awarded annually in aachen for promoting european understanding . polish prime minister donald tusk , 53 , received the charlemagne prize in recognition of his efforts in furthering european understanding and cooperation and bringing poland into the heart of europe .
he accepted the award at a ceremony in the city of aachen on thursday .
the charlemagne judges praised tusk for steering his country away from nationalism , describing him as a " patriot and a great european at the same time . "
from his first moments as prime minister , tusk established that his priorities lay with europe .
in 2007 , when asked where his first foreign trip would be as premier , tusk did not hesitate before naming brussels .
" however , we are in the european union so i wonder if my visit to brussels is a foreign trip at all , " he added .
talking to deutsche welle in aachen while he was there to accept the award , tusk accentuated his loyalty to the concept of europe .
fealty to the union is especially crucial in difficult times , such as during greece 's recent financial crisis , he said .
" the more difficult , the more painful the experience , the more people who doubt us from without , the more we have to hold the flag of europe high and cry out loudly that the european union is a phenomenal concept , " tusk told deutsche welle .
he said europe needs to stay true to its ideals of freedom , and called for more integration - even as he looked toward further eu expansion .
states seeking accession , such as turkey and ukraine , should be asked whether they share european values , and if they want to be part of a society " where everyone stands up for their neighbor , and where solidarity and freedom are more than just empty words . "
poland is set to take on the rotating eu presidency next year .
tusk sees key issues that year as being energy security , defense , and " intelligent policies " when it comes to dealing with the eu 's eastern neighbors .
early career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a student , tusk was involved in the solidarity movement part of tusk 's powerfully pro-european outlook may be due to his home city of gdansk .
the city has a european and international character and has played a key role in many pivotal events of the 20th century .
it was in gdansk where world war ii started , it was also the scene of a massacre of protesting workers by the communists in 1970 , and the place where the trade union solidarity set in motion events leading to the fall of the iron curtain .
as a young history student tusk became involved in the solidarity trade union .
solidarity was a broad anti-communist social movement which had several million members .
the movement was crushed by the then-premier of the people 's republic of poland , wojciech jaruzelski , who imposed martial law on poland in 1981 .
in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , tusk was delighted : " we poles had tears in our eyes .
we felt a great satisfaction in what solidarity had started and then to see this great finale in other european capitals , " he said .
after the iron curtain the fall of the berlin wall and the iron curtain was a symbolic fresh start for political life in poland .
in 1989 , tusk entered parliament for the first time .
his aims were to promote democracy and the free market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk celebrates the victory of his civic platform party in 2007 the 1990s were a politically turbulent decade , but in 2001 , tusk emerged to form his own political party , civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which was pro-european and had its ideological roots in conservative liberalism .
in a tight 2005 presidential race , tusk narrowly lost to conservative and nationalist politician lech kaczynski .
two years later , tusk 's own moment came when his party won a landslide majority and he became prime minister .
speaking on the night of the election , tusk stressed the importance of freedom : " we will ensure that those in power take every care to make sure the poles remain proud and free among the people of europe , " he said .
international relations tusk promised to improve relations with poland 's neighbors , especially russia and germany . the year 2007 marked a turning point in german-polish relations , which had almost ground to a halt under tusk 's predecessor .
during his first visit to berlin , he expressed a wish to improve relations with germany , describing this as a " common task . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's ties with germany have improved since he became prime minister differences remain over plans to build a baltic sea pipeline to transport gas to germany from russia , and over germans displaced during world war ii .
but during tusk 's time in office , poland and germany have been working to find pragmatic solutions to their disputes .
polish relations with russia under tusk have also seen vast improvement . this was in evidence when vladimir putin attended ceremonies commemorating the 70th anniversary of the invasion of poland and a memorial service to those murdered in katyn .
ties have grown even closer since the plane crash in smolensk , in which the then polish president , lech kaczynski , died .
about that crash , tusk told deutsche welle that the tragedy " broke the hearts of poland , but not the stability of the state . "
his comments to dw aside , tusk is not a big talker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 13.05.2010 france 's pompidou-metz brings parisian art to the province großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pompidou center in paris celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007 outspoken architecture and works by major artists often suffice to set a museum in good stead .
but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

this comes a day after spain announced its own budget cuts , triggering protests from trade unions . portugal has become the latest country to introduce austerity measures , after both greece and spain took similar steps to stabilize public finances in the face of massive debt .
portuguese prime minister jose socrates announced spending cuts to slash the 2011 target budget deficit to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , down from a previous estimate of 5.1 percent .
" these measures are crucial to re-establishing confidence and secure financing for the country , " socrates said at a news conference in lisbon .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

during the award ceremony , the 53-year-old was lauded as an outstanding proponent of freedom , democracy and human rights , who never yielded to the communist regime in poland .
proceedings in aachen also focused on the tragic plane crash in russia last month that killed 96 people , including polish president lech kaczynski and his wife .
tusk dedicated his award to their memory .
in his speech , he also accepted the award in honor of the so-called " solidarnosc generation , " a reference to the 1980s trade union movement instrumental in the downfall of communism in the country. mh / dfm / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

nearly 400,000 worshippers attended a mass at the shrine of fatima . nearly half a million people flocked to hear pope benedict xvi celebrate a mass at the shrine of fatima in portugal , one of christianity 's holiest sites .
many of the worshippers had camped out overnight to attend the two-hour ceremony . the overwhelming support was evidence of church 's continued influence despite the sex abuse scandal , said vatican spokesman federico lombardi . " what 's happened in the last few months , with the problems of the abuse scandal , could lead one to think that the attention and energy towards the pope has been weakened , but that has not happened , " he told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mass marked the 93rd anniversary of reported appearances of the virgin mary to shepherd children gay marraige ' threat ' in his speech , the 83-year-old german-born pontiff criticized gay marriage and abortion as " insidious and dangerous threats to the common good . "
portugal is set to legalize gay marriage next week , just three years after the deeply catholic country decriminalized abortion .

it is emerging as bangladesh ’ s largest trade and development partner .
but it was n't always that way . it seems the people of bangladesh no longer think of the negative role china played for the country in its war of independence in 1971 , when china supported pakistan .
instead , they have accepted china as a great friend .
imtiaz ahmed is an analyst of international relations and a professor of dhaka university .
he says china 's policy of not mixing politics with trade has helped the situation .
he says today , people have forgotten about china 's role in the 70s .
" now over the years , china has emerged as the largest trading partner of bangladesh , it has surpassed even india for quite some years .
and is heavily engaged in developing infrastructure , particularly bridges and highways .
so i think there has been a radical transformation when it comes to bangladesh and china 's relationship in the last 30 to 35 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electronics are cheap and popular , especially mp3 players tousia islam is a student at dhaka university and she is a great fan of china .
she thinks china has a lot to offer bangladeshi people .
she says , " chinese food is so popular here .
the most popular thing of china i think is their electronics – they 're very cheap and especially like mobile phones or mp3 players so popular in bangladesh .
i personally like one thing of china , that is their social culture and their family bonding nature .
our country should have a more friendly relation with china because economically they are so developed , they are one of the biggest countries in the world and they are so friendly to all the neighboring countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese food has become popular in bangladesh china 's image " very positive " the chinese have not only impressed the people of bangladesh with their food and culture , but also with their advancements in science and technology .
young bangladeshis want to learn from the middle kingdom and gain the same technical know-how .
journalist arif mahmud says these are the reasons china is welcome : " china has developed in science and technology in the world and especially in the asia-pacific region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshis are impressed with china 's technical know-how china and bangladesh have come a long way since the 1970s .
now there is a bangladesh-china chamber of commerce and industry and the bangladesh china friendship society promotes cultural exchange .
shahjahan mirdha is the head of both organizations .
he praises the two countries ' historic ties and says china has always been important for bangladesh , which is why " all the prime ministers and presidents of bangladesh paid official visits to china – even bangladesh 's founding father , sheikh mujibur rahman .
now 70 percent of our imports come from china .
not only that , but chinese martial arts and dragon dances are now popular in bangladesh as well . "
the bangladesh government seems keen to avoid tensions with china .
last year , a photo exhibition on tibet in dhaka was closed by the authorities after complaints by the chinese embassy .

new york 's attorney general has begun investigating eight banks , including deutsche bank , on their relationships with ratings agencies . new york attorney general andrew cuomo is investigating whether eight banks misled ratings agencies to inflate the grades of certain mortgage securities , reports in the us media said thursday .
late wednesday , the attorney general 's office notified the banks of the investigation , according to a report on the new york times website .
part of a larger securities probe the investigation is part of a larger probe by us authorities questioning the business practices of a range of financial firms whose clients bought mortgage securities in the years leading to the collapse of the housing market in 2008 .
at the heart of that collapse - which triggered the global financial meltdown - is a question of whether or not ratings agencies inflated the debt ratings on mortgage securities that were the foundation of complex and far-reaching investment vehicles .
the inquiry suggests cuomo thinks the agencies may have been tricked by one or more of the targets of his probe , media reports said .
in addition to deutsche bank , those targets include goldman sachs , morgan stanley , ubs , citigroup , credit suisse , credit agricole and merrill lynch , which is now owned by bank of america .
cuomo 's office is reportedly working with together with the securities and exchange commission in the preliminary criminal probe .
lawmakers want aggressive action standard & poor 's , fitch ratings and moody 's investors service were the companies that rated the mortgage deals , the report said .
the agencies have taken flack for overstating the quality of mortgage securities that later lost value in the wake of the housing collapse .
lawmakers are urging prosecutors to be more aggressive in their investigation of the financial crisis .
the latest investigation remains in its preliminary stages , a report in the wall street journal noted , with prosecutors gathering evidence and not yet issuing any criminal subpoenas. jen / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 13.05.2010 france 's pompidou-metz brings parisian art to the province großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pompidou center in paris celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2007 outspoken architecture and works by major artists often suffice to set a museum in good stead .
but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

" i hear one message , and the message is : do n't blame me , " republican senator john barrasso told the energy and natural resources committee hearing .
" well , shifting this blame does not get us very far . "
lamar mckay , president of bp america , said during his testimony that the rig 's owner transocean was responsible .
the swiss drilling company leased oil giant bp the deepwater horizon , which exploded on april 20 and subsequently sank .
" why did transocean 's blowout preventer , the key fail-safe mechanism , fail to operate ? "
mckay told the committee on tuesday .
this mechanism is intended to shut off the flow of oil and gas in case of an accident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckay , president of bp america , is responding to senators ' questions but transocean 's chief executive officer steven newman said in turn that bp as the operator was accountable .
" all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , " newman told the hearing .
he said the drilling process had been completed " and the well already had been sealed with casing and cement " by halliburton .
tim probert of halliburton , which was to have poured cement to close the freshly drilled well until a production rig was installed , insisted his company had not placed the final cement plug at the time of the accident .
he said his company was simply following bp 's instructions , to which it was " contractually bound . "
mounting environmental threat bp has accepted responsibility for the cleanup and is leading efforts to stop an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil from flowing into the gulf of mexico every day .
it plans to make another attempt this week to cover the ruptured well with a so-called " top hat . "
this is a much smaller version of the giant dome it tried to place over the weekend without success .
if the measure is unsuccessful , the spill could become the worst oil leak in us history , according to the head of the environmental protection agency , lisa jackson .
" until we stop the release of oil from the sea bed , it has the potential to be worse than anything that we 've seen , " jackson told cnn .
bildunterschrift : birds are extremely threatened by the oil louisiana 's mississippi river delta is a major migratory spot for rare birds and contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
earlier this week , environmentalist group greenpeace found first traces of oil washed up on the southernmost tip of the state .
the oil onshore at port eads was evidence that it was reaching the mouth of the mississippi , said greenpeace .
this put even more species of louisiana 's coastal habitats at risk , including animal and plant species that thrive only in these wetlands .
" while most of the environmental damage so far from this spill has been out of sight , the oil we saw on the southern delta of the mississippi river is a sad indicator of what is in store for the shoreline ecosystem , " said conservation specialist rick steiner in a greenpeace statement .
steiner is well-known for his work during the exxon valdez disaster in alaska in 1989 .
" as bp scrambles to stop millions of gallons of oil flowing into the gulf , oil is washing up in the irreplaceable wetlands at the southern tip of louisiana , " greenpeace 's deputy campaigns director dan howells said .
" immeasurable damage has been done . "
a blow for the local economy the region 's fishing industry , as well as the tourism sector - two of the gulf 's key industries - have also been hard hit .
the oil spill is only a few miles away from the beaches in the tourism mecca biloxi , mississippi , which has just recently recovered from hurricane katrina in 2005 .
" the oil spill could be a catastrophe of epic proportions if we get that here , " mayor aj holloway told deutsche welle .
" if it comes on our beaches , it would hurt our tourism business tremendously .
our industry for the city of biloxi is tourism . "
bildunterschrift : there are fears the oil spill will cripple the local seafood industry in a body blow to the local economy , the federal government has suspended fishing in parts of the gulf . attorney judy guice is preparing legal action against bp on behalf of those affected by the fishing ban .
" bp has needlessly endangered the public , " guice told deutsche welle .
" one of the primary industries here on the gulf coast is the seafood industry - our fishermen , our shrimpers , our oystermen .
and they are losing their livelihoods as we speak . "
about five dozen fishermen have already contacted guice and more are joining the fight daily .
but she said it will be an uphill battle .
" fighting against a big company like bp is always extremely difficult , very challenging and they fight tooth and nail , " guice said .
" but i 'm confident that with the correct representation , those who have suffered losses will be compensated . "
mckay said in the senate hearing that bp would pay " all legitimate claims " of economic damages well over a $ 75 million legal ceiling .
a political rethink ?
environmentalist groups in the us hope the catastrophe will prompt americans to rethink their attitudes towards energy use .
new leases on offshore drilling in us waters - a measure which president barack obama backed just months ago - have been suspended at least until the end of may .
but bp 's mckay ended his testimony on tuesday by stressing the importance of offshore drilling for us energy needs .
" tragic and unforeseen as this accident was , we must not lose sight of why bp and other energy companies are operating in the offshore , including the gulf of mexico , " he said .
" the gulf provides one in four barrels of oil produced in the united states - a resource our economy requires . "

but will that formula succeed in an eastern french town not known for art ?
the new pompidou center there is set to find out . located squarely between germany , switzerland , luxemburg and belgium , france 's lorraine region has long been a region of cultural interface .
now the region hopes to expand its role as a center for culture with this week 's opening of the pompidou center in its capital city , metz .
the pompidou-metz is an offshoot of the pompidou center in paris , which houses europe 's largest modern art collection .
some 700 of the pompidou 's 65,000 modern and contemporary pieces are on loan for the opening of the new location .
artists like picasso , matisse , rodchenko and miro will now be on display in this town of 120,000 inhabitants .
but dazzling tourists with big names is beside the point for the museum 's opening exhibition , says laurent le bon , director of the pompidou-metz .
" we talk about the democratization of culture in france , which is a simple idea but hard to implement , " le bon told deutsche welle .
" you can come see a real picasso , a real matisse , but we are also trying to interrogate the very idea of a ' masterpiece ' with our first show . "
bildunterschrift : the pompidou-metz 's design may rival some of its masterpieces for attention one of a kind one way in which the metz 's exhibition interrogates masterpieces and sets itself apart from the pompidou-paris is through its innovative juxtaposition of works .
visitors can see bits of film alongside a painting or view a modern sculpture paired with a fetish from the congo .
the relationship between the two pompidou institutions is unusual among art museums .
unlike the regional tate museums , the pompidou-metz will not have its own permanent collection .
but it 's also more than just an annex taking on the unwanted surplus from its big brother in paris , said alain sebon , president of the pompidou-paris .
" i believe the pompidou-metz is a premiere in a way .
it 's not a museum , since it lacks a permanent collection , " sebon said .
" but at the same time , it is autonomous ; it has its own goals and its own financing from the local authorities . "
at least one of the pompidou-metz 's goals is in line with a longstanding objective of the french government : expanding access to culture beyond paris and across class lines .
andre malraux served as france 's first minister of culture following world war ii and helped articulate these aims .
subsequent governments have followed his lead , and recent initiatives in france include increasing contact between schools and art institutions , while expanding art and art history courses .
public funding for the arts is high in france and accounts for most of the pompidou-metz 's budget .
bildunterschrift : the roof of the pompidou-metz can also light up at night from outside inspired by a chinese hut architecture that can delight and attract visitors is an important part of the museum 's concept , according to jean de gastines , who helped design the structure .
he compares the pompidou-metz to the branch of the guggenheim opened in bilbao , spain - another small city that quickly became a major tourist attraction by virtue of its museum .
de gastines was one of two principal architects on the project alongside shigeru ban of japan .
the futuristic design was inspired in part by the form of a chinese hut that shigeru ban had seen .
the museum occupies about 10,000 square meters -lrb- 108,000 square feet -rrb- and cost around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- .
perhaps its most striking feature is a wavy roof that seems to float overhead .
light passes through the roof as well as through the enormous glass surfaces that make up the museum 's core .
how much the museum 's bold design and valuable works can bolster culture in the lorraine region remains to be seen , but museum officials currently expect 200,000 to 300,000 annual visitors .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

new york 's attorney general has begun investigating eight banks , including deutsche bank , on their relationships with ratings agencies . new york attorney general andrew cuomo is investigating whether eight banks misled ratings agencies to inflate the grades of certain mortgage securities , reports in the us media said thursday .
late wednesday , the attorney general 's office notified the banks of the investigation , according to a report on the new york times website .
part of a larger securities probe the investigation is part of a larger probe by us authorities questioning the business practices of a range of financial firms whose clients bought mortgage securities in the years leading to the collapse of the housing market in 2008 .
at the heart of that collapse - which triggered the global financial meltdown - is a question of whether or not ratings agencies inflated the debt ratings on mortgage securities that were the foundation of complex and far-reaching investment vehicles .
the inquiry suggests cuomo thinks the agencies may have been tricked by one or more of the targets of his probe , media reports said .
in addition to deutsche bank , those targets include goldman sachs , morgan stanley , ubs , citigroup , credit suisse , credit agricole and merrill lynch , which is now owned by bank of america .
cuomo 's office is reportedly working with together with the securities and exchange commission in the preliminary criminal probe .
lawmakers want aggressive action standard & poor 's , fitch ratings and moody 's investors service were the companies that rated the mortgage deals , the report said .
the agencies have taken flack for overstating the quality of mortgage securities that later lost value in the wake of the housing collapse .
lawmakers are urging prosecutors to be more aggressive in their investigation of the financial crisis .
the latest investigation remains in its preliminary stages , a report in the wall street journal noted , with prosecutors gathering evidence and not yet issuing any criminal subpoenas. jen / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

chancellor merkel said the eu 's economic woes were among the toughest tests the bloc has ever faced . polish prime minister donald tusk accepted his charlemagne prize for promoting european understanding in aachen on thursday , but used the occasion to point out the economic problems currently facing the european union .
" i paradoxically see the crisis as a chance to strengthen and further develop europe , " tusk said in the western german city .
" the clock has struck for europe , and overcoming the crisis will be the best proof , " tusk said , adding that he did n't believe the spiraling national debts in a number of eu countries , most notably greece , would spell the end of the monetary union .
' existential test ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the euro fail , europe could also fail , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel also said that the group could overcome its monetary woes , but only with decisive action .
she warned that a collapse of the single european currency could set off a chain reaction .
" if the euro fails , not only the currency fails , europe fails too , and the idea of european unification , " said merkel .
" we have a common currency , but no common political and economic union .
and this is exactly what we must change . "
merkel appealed for greater harmonization of eu economic and financial policies , saying that the current problems offered an opportunity to strengthen the eu 's reforming lisbon treaty , which fell short of the more binding language favored by some eu members .
" it is the biggest test that europe has had to overcome since 1990 , or even in the 53 years since the rome treaties were passed , " merkel said , referring to the eu 's post-war inception .
" this test is existential , " she added .
" it must be passed .
if we fail , the consequences for europe and beyond are unforeseeable . "
merkel agreed , however , with the polish prime minister , saying that if europe can overcome these problems , it could emerge stronger than ever before .

proceedings in aachen also focused on the tragic plane crash in russia last month that killed 96 people , including polish president lech kaczynski and his wife .
tusk dedicated his award to their memory .
in his speech , he also accepted the award in honor of the so-called " solidarnosc generation , " a reference to the 1980s trade union movement instrumental in the downfall of communism in the country. mh / dfm / dpa / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
