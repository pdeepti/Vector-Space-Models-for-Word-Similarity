program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 03.12.2010 eu bans ' meow meow ' party drug großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mephedrone has effects comparable to ecstasy the eu has introduced a europe-wide ban on mephedrone , popularly known as " meow meow . "
the drug is available in 12 eu member states , and is often sold on the internet .
however , it has been linked to a number of deaths . the european union banned the ecstasy-like party-drug mephedrone , also known as " meow meow " on friday .
the action follows in the footsteps of 15 individual european countries which had moved to ban the substance of their own accord .
" it is good to see that eu governments are prepared to take swift action to ban this dangerous drug , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said .
" -lsb- mephedrone -rsb- is sold over the internet , often behind innocent names like plant food or bath salts .
young people should not be fooled .
these drugs are harmful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding said the drug was harmful the ban includes the manufacturing and marketing of mephedrone across the european union .
the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland alone .
britain banned the substance earlier this year .
deceptively harmful mephedrone hydrochloride salt , as the drug is scientifically known , is commercially available from chemical suppliers on the internet , or from street dealers .
generally , it sells for around 10 euros to 15 euros -lrb- $ 14 to $ 20 -rrb- per gram .
it can be obtained in powder , capsule or tablet form .
owing to the fact that it is still legal in a number of countries , many users mistakenly believe it is harmless .
however , a scientific risk assessment carried out by the lisbon-based european monitoring center on drugs and drug addition -lrb- emcdda -rrb- showed that mephedrone can cause acute health problems and lead to dependency .
in at least two cases in the eu it is believed to have been the sole cause of death of people who took it .
users reportedly experience " euphoria , general stimulation , enhanced music appreciation , elevated mood , decreased hostility , improved mental function and mild sexual stimulation . "
the center reported that it is predominantly used by young people , aged 15 to 24 , and that rates of drug use are higher in males than in females .
it is often taken in night clubs or dance events .
mephodrone , also known as " bubble or " neodave " has no medical value .
the ban will not affect legislation in germany , where mephedrone has been illegal for years .
it is also already banned in austria , belgium , britain , denmark , estonia , france , ireland , italy , latvia , luxembourg , malta , poland , romania and sweden .
countries such as spain , portugal , greece and the netherlands will now have to comply with the ruling and bring their laws in line with the rest of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 03.12.2010 german boardrooms remain a man 's domain - for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are underrepresented in german top management the green party has received a mixed response from all sides for its aim of setting a legal quota for top management posts .
there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure .

the first half of their match on friday against fellow promoted side kaiserslautern was marked by a lack of highlights from the evenly matched teams .
both teams struggled on the slippery , snowy pitch in hamburg , however when they had chances , they failed to capitalize .
shortly after the break , st. pauli got on the board when kaiserslautern 's christian tiffert inadvertently headed the ball into his own team 's goal .
the score provided the impetus for both clubs to open up the game more , but st. pauli held off the visitors to grab three important points .
both teams now have 17 points , but still remain near the bottom of the table .

" there is no crisis for the euro as a currency , " trichet said friday in a radio interview on france 's rtl radio network .
" we have problems of financial instability that are the result of budget crises in certain european countries . "
essential for investor confidence trichet added that the central bank has the " same message " for all countries - namely , to " take all measures to make next year 's fiscal objectives credible . "
he said such action is essential for investor confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.12.2010 free democrat politician demands us ambassador 's recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says no confidential information was leaked a member of parliament has called for the us ambassador to be recalled in connection with the release of wikileaks cables .
the demand came a day after a member of the fdp was identified as the source of leaks to the us . a scandal involving the publication of diplomatic cables by wikileaks and germany 's free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- has prompted an fdp politician to demand the recall of the us ambassador in berlin , phillip murphy .
hans-michael goldmann told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that murphy has " failed " in his handling of the affair and that " if this conduct were displayed by a german ambassador he would be recalled home . "
goldmann said murphy had yet to apologize for the embarrassing comments made by us officials regarding high-ranking german politicians , which were brought to light by the wikileaks publication .
he also criticized statements by murphy surrounding allegations of a german informant who leaked information to the us during coalition talks between the fdp and angela merkel 's christian democrats last year .
leak identified the chief of staff for vice chancellor guido westerwelle - who is also the head of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was exposed on thursday as the source of leaks to the us that have embarrassed washington and threatened to strain its relations with berlin .
helmut metzner was relieved of his duties on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murphy has been in the post since last year " the staff member of the fdp 's federal headquarters , who has admitted his contacts with the us embassy in berlin , has been relieved of his duties as chief of staff for the fdp chairman by mutual agreement , " party spokesman wulf oehme said in a brief statement .
the diplomatic cables showed that an fdp insider had given regular updates to a us embassy contact from closed-door coalition talks between the fdp and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- following last year 's election .
murphy described metzner as a " fly on the wall , a young , up-and-coming party loyalist who was taking notes during the marathon talks . "
' that 's no mole ' meanwhile , german development minister , dirk niebel , who is a leading member of the fdp , has rejected the notion that metzner leaked any confidential information to the us during the october 2009 talks .
" that 's no mole , " niebel told german public television on friday morning , adding that the 41-year-old metzner 's " informant role " to the us embassy in berlin was " completely normal political business . "
" what he ' leaked ' to the us , for instance , was that one of our party 's intentions was to have all nuclear weapons stored by the us in germany removed once and for all : this is not secret information .
you could have also read it in our election platform , " niebel said .
nevertheless , the fdp said on thursday that metzner would take on another role at the party , which has struggled in opinion polls in the country since achieving record results in last september 's general election .
recent polls suggest support of the fdp is below five percent - under the level required to enter parliament .
this compares with nearly 15 percent at the september 2009 elections , which helped angela merkel secure a second term as chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 03.12.2010 dating berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the people i know in berlin are no berliners .
and that 's not because i dislike the locals , but because it 's rather difficult to find them .
my city is the city of everyone . it was one of those perfect early weekend mornings , when you get out of the club and can smell the fresh air again .
i opted to walk home , even though it took an eternity , instead of calling a cab or waiting for the subway .
that was the moment when i started dating my city . berlin is mean .
every encounter is a new experience and , once trapped , you never want to leave again .
i did n't find a crumbling colosseum on my way that morning , neither did i see an eiffel tower , or anything else that impresses at first glance .
instead , the smell of the cafes still open at 5 am , tired ravers ordering the famous after-party berliner currywurst at a corner stand , bizarre pieces of art in gallery windows , remains of the berlin wall turned into a canvas for graffiti - block after block , it slowly got under my skin .
it was a feeling that outdid any paris or rome . it happens to all the people i know : they move here and inevitably fall in love with the city . it 's the imperfection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't find anything like this in berlin after visiting berlin , a friend of mine decided to sell his flat in the us and move here .
he had no plans , no apartment , and no job .
but he had berlin and that was enough .
a swedish friend of mine got a great job in london after spending a few years in berlin .
she earns much more than she did here , but is still desperately looking for any reason to come back to live in her old neighborhood again . another woman i know moved here from west germany , right after the fall of the berlin wall .
" it 's the imperfection of this city that i love - the chaos that makes it so special , " she told me .
and to quote some famous berlin fans , the guys from depeche mode , one could describe this madness as " no strings attached , just free love . " berlin makes you become someone else every day , just to adapt to its myriad facets .
a journey from nonconformist prenzlauer berg , where you have to stand out to fit in , along the extravagant-trashy mitte district , and ending in fancy charlottenburg is like a trip around the world - a very inexpensive one . one minute , berlin is so german and the next minute it 's everything else : russian , french , american , british , turkish , polish .
and sooner or later it turns german again . the best part is , here you can be anything , without being judged for it .
i once heard someone on the local radio saying that berlin is the place where you do n't know if something is a piece of art or a piece of garbage . flexibility required and you have to be an artist , indeed , to appreciate thousands of paradoxes that make up this city .
here , you can spend an evening at the opera and later go to a sassy fashion show , organized in a church .
you can have a drink in one of the bars housed in the rundown tacheles building -lrb- now one of the hottest spots in berlin -rrb- and then have dinner at a restaurant just a few meters away , where the brand of your scarf will suspiciously be eyed for authenticity . leave on holiday for two weeks and your beloved bakery will turn into a shoe shop , your apartment building will start getting refurbished and the metro you usually take to work wo n't be running for the next five months , due to construction work . i had an italian colleague at the university in berlin who could n't speak a word of german -lrb- we studied in english -rrb- .
well , just one word , actually : he could perfectly pronounce the tongue-twister schienenersatzverkehr .
it means that some alternative means of transport are substituting the metro you had been counting on because the rails are currently under construction .
it also means your morning commute will be a nightmare .
i guarantee it will be one of the first words you learn when you move to berlin . bildunterschrift : berlin kept the street lights that were used in communist east germany love affair with the past berlin is someone else 's past meeting your future .
and the best place to witness that is at the flea markets .
everything related to the socialist regime is more than trendy here : plastic kitchen utensils , empty boxes of washing powder , even worn-out 30-year-old shoes .
in berlin , gdr sells . nevertheless , berlin is not entirely monogamous in its love affair with the past : there 's a market for new ideas , too .
in berlin you can even make money selling paper eyeglasses made of recycled cardboard - which have no lenses and , basically , no practical use whatsoever .
a few months ago , a young berliner started wearing them at parties , just for fun , and soon they created near hysteria in the city 's hottest clubs .
now , his so-called " pappbrille " are a viable business . sometimes , this city is such a jumbled concoction that it can overwhelm .
a local photographer once said , " i have to take berlin in small doses , so i can digest it " . but i 'm still grabbing any opportunity to date my city .
i 'm ready for its imperfection and its nasty moods ; i 'm even ready for schienenersatzverkehr and construction sites , as long as i have this beautifully arranged chaos , where garbage is art and vice versa . it 's been a few years now and i 'm far from getting bored . author : lavinia pitu editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who is the man behind the wikileaks ?
i was an american sailor and i am an american citizen .
i support the man behind the wikileaks for bringing this information out .
they are right for putting the truth out for the world to know .
hopefully this kind of open government can catch on and it will mean more peace through communication and understanding . - bruce , us we will never know who is really behind julian assange .
we live in the times of such disinformation that this is an enigmatic affair of our global village . - agatha , canada he should be as afraid of the us as when somebody blows the whistle on a drug baron or a mafia boss . - alberto , great britain my opinion is that wikileaks is making a very constructive effort in promoting government by and for the people . - peter , us this is obviously a sick man with a need to feel special and garner attention .
he is probably paid off by russia or china to make the us look bad , because we finally have an intelligent president , and these countries ca n't stand it .
bush did n't need wikileaks ... he screwed up on his own .
assange is easy to diffuse - just create 10 carbon copy wikileaks sites with fake data .
nobody will know who to believe , and -lsb- assange -rsb- will not have as much interest in causing trouble anymore , because he will not feel special . - dan , us julian assange is a hero and putting his life at risk for mankind and the survival of the species by way of information and awareness correction like a correction in the stock markets .
unfortunately he has awakened a giant bear , and it 's coming after him , and his life will never be the same .
he is a real warrior , not a faceless creature hiding behind created authority . - lien , germany in my opinion , julian assange should not be the target of any legal action .
what is amazing is that interpol has many real threats to humanity such as dictators like fidel , raul castro and others .
please support a person who combats wrongdoing whatever the government affected . - liborio , cuba us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts should the us prosecute julian assange ?
no , assange was only trying to show how much hypocrisy is in the world of diplomacy and military blunder .
he should be praised for his courage . - g. , canada a lot of americans have worked hard to repair relations with germany after the iraq war .
i have reviewed the laws with several lawyers and it seems near impossible to prosecute julian assange at this time .
he really set our collective efforts back several years .
it 's very disparaging to read the german newspapers lately , and my heart sinks how far these leaks have set our relations back .
it 's a sad day here in america to see my friends in germany so upset . - stephen , us why ?
he did n't spy and he did n't steal .
the information was passed on to wikileaks by an american citizen , and assange accepted it .
the us was caught with its pants down , and now it 'll try every dirty trick in the book to find fault somewhere else ... except with itself . - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

the first half of their match on friday against fellow promoted side kaiserslautern was marked by a lack of highlights from the evenly matched teams .
both teams struggled on the slippery , snowy pitch in hamburg , however when they had chances , they failed to capitalize .
shortly after the break , st. pauli got on the board when kaiserslautern 's christian tiffert inadvertently headed the ball into his own team 's goal .
the score provided the impetus for both clubs to open up the game more , but st. pauli held off the visitors to grab three important points .
both teams now have 17 points , but still remain near the bottom of the table .

there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 03.12.2010 german boardrooms remain a man 's domain - for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are underrepresented in german top management the green party has received a mixed response from all sides for its aim of setting a legal quota for top management posts .
there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

"
the drug is available in 12 eu member states , and is often sold on the internet .
however , it has been linked to a number of deaths . the european union banned the ecstasy-like party-drug mephedrone , also known as " meow meow " on friday .
the action follows in the footsteps of 15 individual european countries which had moved to ban the substance of their own accord .
" it is good to see that eu governments are prepared to take swift action to ban this dangerous drug , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said .
" -lsb- mephedrone -rsb- is sold over the internet , often behind innocent names like plant food or bath salts .
young people should not be fooled .
these drugs are harmful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding said the drug was harmful the ban includes the manufacturing and marketing of mephedrone across the european union .
the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland alone .
britain banned the substance earlier this year .
deceptively harmful mephedrone hydrochloride salt , as the drug is scientifically known , is commercially available from chemical suppliers on the internet , or from street dealers .
generally , it sells for around 10 euros to 15 euros -lrb- $ 14 to $ 20 -rrb- per gram .
it can be obtained in powder , capsule or tablet form .
owing to the fact that it is still legal in a number of countries , many users mistakenly believe it is harmless .
however , a scientific risk assessment carried out by the lisbon-based european monitoring center on drugs and drug addition -lrb- emcdda -rrb- showed that mephedrone can cause acute health problems and lead to dependency .
in at least two cases in the eu it is believed to have been the sole cause of death of people who took it .
users reportedly experience " euphoria , general stimulation , enhanced music appreciation , elevated mood , decreased hostility , improved mental function and mild sexual stimulation . "
the center reported that it is predominantly used by young people , aged 15 to 24 , and that rates of drug use are higher in males than in females .
it is often taken in night clubs or dance events .
mephodrone , also known as " bubble or " neodave " has no medical value .
the ban will not affect legislation in germany , where mephedrone has been illegal for years .
it is also already banned in austria , belgium , britain , denmark , estonia , france , ireland , italy , latvia , luxembourg , malta , poland , romania and sweden .
countries such as spain , portugal , greece and the netherlands will now have to comply with the ruling and bring their laws in line with the rest of the eu .

who is the man behind the wikileaks ?
i was an american sailor and i am an american citizen .
i support the man behind the wikileaks for bringing this information out .
they are right for putting the truth out for the world to know .
hopefully this kind of open government can catch on and it will mean more peace through communication and understanding . - bruce , us we will never know who is really behind julian assange .
we live in the times of such disinformation that this is an enigmatic affair of our global village . - agatha , canada he should be as afraid of the us as when somebody blows the whistle on a drug baron or a mafia boss . - alberto , great britain my opinion is that wikileaks is making a very constructive effort in promoting government by and for the people . - peter , us this is obviously a sick man with a need to feel special and garner attention .
he is probably paid off by russia or china to make the us look bad , because we finally have an intelligent president , and these countries ca n't stand it .
bush did n't need wikileaks ... he screwed up on his own .
assange is easy to diffuse - just create 10 carbon copy wikileaks sites with fake data .
nobody will know who to believe , and -lsb- assange -rsb- will not have as much interest in causing trouble anymore , because he will not feel special . - dan , us julian assange is a hero and putting his life at risk for mankind and the survival of the species by way of information and awareness correction like a correction in the stock markets .
unfortunately he has awakened a giant bear , and it 's coming after him , and his life will never be the same .
he is a real warrior , not a faceless creature hiding behind created authority . - lien , germany in my opinion , julian assange should not be the target of any legal action .
what is amazing is that interpol has many real threats to humanity such as dictators like fidel , raul castro and others .
please support a person who combats wrongdoing whatever the government affected . - liborio , cuba us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts should the us prosecute julian assange ?
no , assange was only trying to show how much hypocrisy is in the world of diplomacy and military blunder .
he should be praised for his courage . - g. , canada a lot of americans have worked hard to repair relations with germany after the iraq war .
i have reviewed the laws with several lawyers and it seems near impossible to prosecute julian assange at this time .
he really set our collective efforts back several years .
it 's very disparaging to read the german newspapers lately , and my heart sinks how far these leaks have set our relations back .
it 's a sad day here in america to see my friends in germany so upset . - stephen , us why ?
he did n't spy and he did n't steal .
the information was passed on to wikileaks by an american citizen , and assange accepted it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 03.12.2010 integrating students with disabilities in german schools still a battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's mother fought for him to attend an integrated school for german children with disabilities it 's always been difficult to get regular schools to allow them to attend .
now , however , things must change because of a un convention requiring schools to accept all children . when marcel was old enough to start school , his mother picked out one of the public elementary schools in their neighborhood for him .
the school , however , said he could n't attend .
why ?
they said they were n't set up to deal with a kid in a wheelchair .
for decades that 's the way it was in germany .
children with disabilities were sent to separate schools , each one specialized for a different disability .
that is all set to change now that germany has ratified a united nations resolution that says that all children with disabilities have a right to be educated at a regular school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's teacher says he 's totally integrated in his class it 's set to be a long process .
currently the majority of german children with disabilities do n't go to regular schools .
so far the city-state of bremen is the only german state to open all its schools to everyone .
in north rhine-westphalia , where marcel lives , that could be a long way off , although he did eventually find a spot in what is called an integrated or inclusive school .
" we had a hard struggle with the administration , " his mother told deutsche welle , " because i did n't want him to go to those special schools for the handicapped .
i wanted him to go to a normal school with all his friends from the neighborhood and i did n't want him to be separated from real life . "
marcel 's mother said she 's convinced that if she had n't put up such a fight and even threatened to take the school district to court he would never have been given a spot in one of the few schools in the area that teaches the disabled and the non-disabled together .
still not an option at many schools the elementary school that refused to accept marcel years ago still does n't take kids with disabilities , saying on its website that " because this is not an integration school , we can not support children with disabilities and therefore we can not accept them . "
the school is an old , brick building in a bonn neighborhood peppered with half-timber cottages with green shutters .
inside the school , a wide staircase winds its way up four flights of stairs .
at the very top the school principal , jutta fremerey , has her office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old buildings are just one hurdle to integration in germany " we ca n't take kids in wheelchairs , just because of the building , " said fremerey .
" and there are lots of buildings in germany where it would n't be possible .
at least not yet . "
fremerey was not the principal when marcel tried to attend .
she said she supports the idea of having children with disabilities in the same classroom as children without disabilities in theory , but that a lot needs to change before that would be feasible nationwide .
she would need at least two teachers per class , she said , and one of them would have to be specially trained for teaching disabled children .
she said she 'd need small extra rooms where kids could get more personal attention and all of the lessons would have to be adapted for each of the children with disabilities .
" because there are lots and lots of totally different types of disabilities and everyone needs something different , " fremerey said .
" the blind child needs something completely different from the child who ca n't hear .
the mentally disabled child needs completely different conditions than a child with emotional or social problems .
those different requirements need to be addressed . "
according to anne waldschmidt , a professor of disability studies at the university of cologne , that kind of differentiation should be expected of a teacher .
" integration or inclusion means more personalized ways of teaching … to differentiate the subjects and the topics and to give every child the chance to learn according to personality and to individual interests and at their own pace , " she said .
" so that means the whole atmosphere is more individualized and that there is n't a standard approach . "
three adults in the classroom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in marcel 's class there are three adults to help students marcel 's school , which is also in bonn , has the manpower to do just that .
in addition to the various subject-matter teachers that teach his class math , german , english or history , a special education teacher is also present all day long .
bringing the number of adults in the classroom to three is marcel 's attendant , who only occasionally has to get marcel a book he needs but can spend the rest of the time helping other kids in the class one-on-one .
marcel is totally integrated into his class , his special education teacher daniel mays said , as are the five students with learning disabilities .
" being with the other kids , it gives you the feeling of just being normal , " marcel said .
his classmate may said she does n't forget that marcel is in a wheelchair , but that it does n't make much of a difference in their friendship .
" i think it 's like with anybody else , " she said .
" when i 'm with other guys i act the same way . "
despite these successes only two of six classes in each grade at the school are integrated and it is not required to take on more disabled children .
slow progress germany may officially be on board with bringing differently abled children together , but it still has a relatively low rate of integration .
according to the european agency for development in special needs education , only about 15 percent of children with disabilities are educated in a regular classroom in germany .
in neighboring france and poland , for example , it 's about 31 percent and 46 percent , respectively .
according to mays , who has done his own statistical analysis for the state of north rhine-westphalia , any recent increase to germany 's level of integration is undone by the fact that more and more children who already attend regular schools are being identified as having a disability , usually a learning or emotional disability .
at the same time germans are having fewer children than in the past and the number of pupils drops each year .
" now we have the un convention for the rights of people with disabilities and germany ratified it a year ago .
we have to change our system into an inclusive system , " marcel 's mother said .
" but no one is willing , really willing to do it .
there are several examples like this school here .
they 've been doing it for many years .
but it 's just two classes per grade level that do integration .
why is n't it all of them ? "

" there is no crisis for the euro as a currency , " trichet said friday in a radio interview on france 's rtl radio network .
" we have problems of financial instability that are the result of budget crises in certain european countries . "
essential for investor confidence trichet added that the central bank has the " same message " for all countries - namely , to " take all measures to make next year 's fiscal objectives credible . "
he said such action is essential for investor confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 03.12.2010 german boardrooms remain a man 's domain - for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are underrepresented in german top management the green party has received a mixed response from all sides for its aim of setting a legal quota for top management posts .
there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

'
that was the us assessment of attitudes in germany and bavaria after an undocumented immigrant , a brown bear named bruno , briefly sought a new home . in one of the lighter diplomatic cables unveiled by wikileaks , it seems the us consulate in munich took considerable interest in one of bavaria 's most ill-fated immigrants - a brown bear given the name bruno .
bruno was part of a scheme to reintroduce wild bears from slovenia into the alps .
via italy and austria , he made his way to germany and was first sighted on may 20 , 2006 .
his stay was a short but eventful one , before he died at the barrel of a gun .
" as the first wild bear seen in germany since 1835 , bruno was initially extended a warm public welcome by -lsb- then -rsb- bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf , " the rather light-hearted missive to washington , signed by the former us consul general to munich , matthew rooney , recalled .
" after all , bruno could prove a boon for bavaria 's image just as visitors from around the world arrived for the world cup . "
the state premier at the time , edmund stoiber , also quickly welcomed bruno to the country , but even this gesture of friendship carried an underlying threat .
" a bear that behaves normally lives in the woods , never leaves , and snatches perhaps one or two sheep each year , " stoiber said , trying to reassure people that bruno posed no threat .
" however , as -lsb- then -rsb- bavarian interior minister -lsb- guenther -rsb- beckstein has often emphasized , foreigners are only welcome in bavaria provided they are willing to adapt to german culture and traditions , " the diplomatic message to washington cautioned with the benefit of hindsight .
' the problem bear ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno 's appetite for livestock and bold behavior made him ' ursus non grata ' bruno proved smarter than stoiber 's average bear - or rather , more troublesome .
before long , he was spied raiding stables , killing sheep , chickens , and even a child 's pet rabbit , and the us diplomat recalled how he quickly became " ursus non grata . "
" vexed by bruno 's unchecked roaming across bavaria - he was even seen sitting on the steps of a police station eating a guinea pig - -lsb- state premier -rsb- edmund stoiber took to referring to him as ' the problem bear . " '
after weeks of being germany 's new poster boy , suddenly bruno was wanted , dead or alive .
but the government 's shoot-to-kill order met considerable resistance from the public ; letters poured in to the environment minister from children around the country calling for him to spare bruno .
seeking to avoid a public outcry , the bavarian government spent at least 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 165,000 -rrb- to fly in a special bear trap from the us and trained hunters with dogs from finland .
yet these efforts did not bear fruit , and on june 26 hunting season was declared open once again .
bruno was shot dead before lunchtime .
consul general rooney notes that spiegel online likened bruno 's death with that of elvis , marilyn monroe , jimi hendrix , john lennon , and princess diana .
the online portal of der spiegel magazine , which cooperated with wikileaks in releasing the cables , was also the first to publish rooney 's comments on bruno in germany .
' modern germany … coexists uneasily with untamed nature ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' bruno the bear - shot dead by dastardly murderers on june 26 , 2006 , ' the memorial reads the initial backlash to bruno 's demise was fierce , with death threats leveled against then environment minister schnappauf and the hunter who shot the brown bear .
despite this , the us consul general in munich told his bosses in washington to expect any fallout to be " relatively fleeting , " also noting in a humorously understated manner that radical animal rights activists who make death threats are n't exactly considered the base of the christian , conservative csu party ruling the state .
" perhaps the greatest insight from the whole bruno affair might be that despite the veneer of ' greenness ' extolled by german society , modern germany in fact coexists rather uneasily with untamed nature , " rooney posited .
" true wilderness , even in mountainous bavaria , has n't really existed in germany for generations - nature is good , as long as it is controlled , channeled , subdued . "
bruno was the last known brown bear to enter the german alps .
the message to washington - which was coordinated with the us embassy in berlin - concluded that any endeavor to repopulate the region with wild creatures would probably be pointless .
" if the saga of bavaria 's ' problem bear ' is any indicator , the strategy of reintroducing wild bears to the alps , at least the german alps , may be doomed to failure - that is , unless the bears are willing to cooperate by not being too wild . "

voice chats are n't permitted , but there 's no telling what sites passengers might visit . passengers on board transatlantic lufthansa flights , flying high in the sky , can now stay connected to the rest of the world via wireless broadband internet connections .
the airline began offering its flynet service on dec .
1 , with connections fast enough to watch videos and play online games .
although internet telephony services such as skype are not blocked , their use wo n't be permitted .
in the spring of 2011 , the company will also make mobile phone technology available for text messaging and wireless data transfer via smart phones .
lufthansa had offered the same service through connexion by boeing in 2003 but stopped in 2006 when boeing discontinued the service .
at the time , the service was used by some 30,000 passengers per month .
lufthansa press speaker boris ogursky said boeing apparently did not see the service as economically viable at the time .
" we found that to be very unfortunate , " he told deutsche welle .
" but at the time , it was clear to us – and it was clear fairly quickly – that we wanted to find a way to offer a similar service .
from our perspective , the experience was positive . "
more internet-capable devices than ever ogursky said lufthansa decided to offer the flynet service because of the benefit to customers - and to the airline .
" the fact that we offer -lrb- broadband -rrb- internet access sets us apart ... and we hope that we will be able to increase demand this way , " he said , adding that " now significantly more customers have a device capable of connecting to a wireless lan . "
according deutsche bank research analyst eric heymann , the proliferation of smartphones makes the economics of in-flight internet more viable than it was in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panasonic 's margis and lufthansa 's mayrhuber shook on the deal in 2009 " the increasing use of smartphones and other mobile devices will speed this development up , " he told deutsche welle .
" at any rate , such devices are a very clear step in the direction of mobile internet use in general . "
available to all passengers lufthansa 's ogursky said flynet is available " not just in the premium classes ; every passenger on board a -lrb- transatlantic -rrb- long-distance flight will be able to use this service . "
the fee is 10.95 euros for one hour and 19.95 euros for 24 hours .
ogursky also said the company 's decision not to permit internet telephony was based on customer surveys that indicated many would not be in favor of the move .
by comparison , deutsche bahn , which offers internet access currently in 72 high-speed ice trains , permits mobile phone conversations on board .
analyst heymann , however , sides with lufthansa .
" in business travel , some people enjoy that they are n't available for a while , " he said .
" it 's sort of the last mobile-phone-free zone . "
flynet is offered through panasonic avionics corporation and uses the payment system of deutsche telekom .
the deutsche telekom payment system can be used with a network of 8,000 hotspots throughout germany .

available to all passengers lufthansa 's ogursky said flynet is available " not just in the premium classes ; every passenger on board a -lrb- transatlantic -rrb- long-distance flight will be able to use this service . "
the fee is 10.95 euros for one hour and 19.95 euros for 24 hours .
ogursky also said the company 's decision not to permit internet telephony was based on customer surveys that indicated many would not be in favor of the move .
by comparison , deutsche bahn , which offers internet access currently in 72 high-speed ice trains , permits mobile phone conversations on board .
analyst heymann , however , sides with lufthansa .
" in business travel , some people enjoy that they are n't available for a while , " he said .
" it 's sort of the last mobile-phone-free zone . "
flynet is offered through panasonic avionics corporation and uses the payment system of deutsche telekom .
the deutsche telekom payment system can be used with a network of 8,000 hotspots throughout germany .

the lawyer heading up the investigation , marion westpfahl , said at a press conference on friday that the available records pointed to huge gaps in the documentation between 1945 and 2009 .
she added this hinted strongly at a " systematic system of cover-up , " in which few abuse cases were criminally prosecuted .
" only 26 priests were convicted for sexual offences , " westpfahl explained to reporters , saying she found 365 files containing evidence that " acts of abuse had taken place in an almost commonplace manner . "
" we have to assume that there is a large unknown number -lsb- of abuse cases -rsb- , " she said .
" we are dealing with the extensive destruction of files . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich and freising archdiocese was run by the current pope in his younger days the incriminating evidence westpfahl found among 13,200 available files implicated 159 priests , 15 deacons , 96 religion teachers and six pastoral employees , with rural areas particularly affected .
the victims ' suffering often remained a mystery , she said , as the reports usually discussed abuse in coy euphemisms .
details sketchy on papal era westpfahl also said that the period of 1977 to 1982 , when pope benedikt xvi - then archbishop josef ratzinger - headed up the archdiocese , was particularly poorly documented .
in this timeframe , she only found one document , regarding an abuse case .
ratzinger had dealt with the case himself , ordering that an abusive priest be removed from his parish , she said .
westpfahl praised the church for giving her free reign in her research , a task to which she was assigned by current archbishop reinhard marx .
" for me , these were surely the worst months of my life , " marx told reporters on friday .
" i felt shame , grief and dismay .
as a church , we ask forgiveness for those things done by our church employees . "
the archdiocese of munich and freising was one of the worst hit in germany during the wave of abuse accusations that swept across much of europe in 2009 , and westpfahl 's report was commissioned in response to the allegations .

the first half of their match on friday against fellow promoted side kaiserslautern was marked by a lack of highlights from the evenly matched teams .
both teams struggled on the slippery , snowy pitch in hamburg , however when they had chances , they failed to capitalize .
shortly after the break , st. pauli got on the board when kaiserslautern 's christian tiffert inadvertently headed the ball into his own team 's goal .
the score provided the impetus for both clubs to open up the game more , but st. pauli held off the visitors to grab three important points .
both teams now have 17 points , but still remain near the bottom of the table .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.12.2010 free democrat politician demands us ambassador 's recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp says no confidential information was leaked a member of parliament has called for the us ambassador to be recalled in connection with the release of wikileaks cables .
the demand came a day after a member of the fdp was identified as the source of leaks to the us . a scandal involving the publication of diplomatic cables by wikileaks and germany 's free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- has prompted an fdp politician to demand the recall of the us ambassador in berlin , phillip murphy .
hans-michael goldmann told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that murphy has " failed " in his handling of the affair and that " if this conduct were displayed by a german ambassador he would be recalled home . "
goldmann said murphy had yet to apologize for the embarrassing comments made by us officials regarding high-ranking german politicians , which were brought to light by the wikileaks publication .
he also criticized statements by murphy surrounding allegations of a german informant who leaked information to the us during coalition talks between the fdp and angela merkel 's christian democrats last year .
leak identified the chief of staff for vice chancellor guido westerwelle - who is also the head of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was exposed on thursday as the source of leaks to the us that have embarrassed washington and threatened to strain its relations with berlin .
helmut metzner was relieved of his duties on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murphy has been in the post since last year " the staff member of the fdp 's federal headquarters , who has admitted his contacts with the us embassy in berlin , has been relieved of his duties as chief of staff for the fdp chairman by mutual agreement , " party spokesman wulf oehme said in a brief statement .
the diplomatic cables showed that an fdp insider had given regular updates to a us embassy contact from closed-door coalition talks between the fdp and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- following last year 's election .
murphy described metzner as a " fly on the wall , a young , up-and-coming party loyalist who was taking notes during the marathon talks . "
' that 's no mole ' meanwhile , german development minister , dirk niebel , who is a leading member of the fdp , has rejected the notion that metzner leaked any confidential information to the us during the october 2009 talks .
" that 's no mole , " niebel told german public television on friday morning , adding that the 41-year-old metzner 's " informant role " to the us embassy in berlin was " completely normal political business . "
" what he ' leaked ' to the us , for instance , was that one of our party 's intentions was to have all nuclear weapons stored by the us in germany removed once and for all : this is not secret information .
you could have also read it in our election platform , " niebel said .
nevertheless , the fdp said on thursday that metzner would take on another role at the party , which has struggled in opinion polls in the country since achieving record results in last september 's general election .
recent polls suggest support of the fdp is below five percent - under the level required to enter parliament .
this compares with nearly 15 percent at the september 2009 elections , which helped angela merkel secure a second term as chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .

most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

who is the man behind the wikileaks ?
i was an american sailor and i am an american citizen .
i support the man behind the wikileaks for bringing this information out .
they are right for putting the truth out for the world to know .
hopefully this kind of open government can catch on and it will mean more peace through communication and understanding . - bruce , us we will never know who is really behind julian assange .
we live in the times of such disinformation that this is an enigmatic affair of our global village . - agatha , canada he should be as afraid of the us as when somebody blows the whistle on a drug baron or a mafia boss . - alberto , great britain my opinion is that wikileaks is making a very constructive effort in promoting government by and for the people . - peter , us this is obviously a sick man with a need to feel special and garner attention .
he is probably paid off by russia or china to make the us look bad , because we finally have an intelligent president , and these countries ca n't stand it .
bush did n't need wikileaks ... he screwed up on his own .
assange is easy to diffuse - just create 10 carbon copy wikileaks sites with fake data .
nobody will know who to believe , and -lsb- assange -rsb- will not have as much interest in causing trouble anymore , because he will not feel special . - dan , us julian assange is a hero and putting his life at risk for mankind and the survival of the species by way of information and awareness correction like a correction in the stock markets .
unfortunately he has awakened a giant bear , and it 's coming after him , and his life will never be the same .
he is a real warrior , not a faceless creature hiding behind created authority . - lien , germany in my opinion , julian assange should not be the target of any legal action .
what is amazing is that interpol has many real threats to humanity such as dictators like fidel , raul castro and others .
please support a person who combats wrongdoing whatever the government affected . - liborio , cuba us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts should the us prosecute julian assange ?
no , assange was only trying to show how much hypocrisy is in the world of diplomacy and military blunder .
he should be praised for his courage . - g. , canada a lot of americans have worked hard to repair relations with germany after the iraq war .
i have reviewed the laws with several lawyers and it seems near impossible to prosecute julian assange at this time .
he really set our collective efforts back several years .
it 's very disparaging to read the german newspapers lately , and my heart sinks how far these leaks have set our relations back .
it 's a sad day here in america to see my friends in germany so upset . - stephen , us why ?
he did n't spy and he did n't steal .
the information was passed on to wikileaks by an american citizen , and assange accepted it .
the us was caught with its pants down , and now it 'll try every dirty trick in the book to find fault somewhere else ... except with itself . - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

who is the man behind the wikileaks ?
i was an american sailor and i am an american citizen .
i support the man behind the wikileaks for bringing this information out .
they are right for putting the truth out for the world to know .
hopefully this kind of open government can catch on and it will mean more peace through communication and understanding . - bruce , us we will never know who is really behind julian assange .
we live in the times of such disinformation that this is an enigmatic affair of our global village . - agatha , canada he should be as afraid of the us as when somebody blows the whistle on a drug baron or a mafia boss . - alberto , great britain my opinion is that wikileaks is making a very constructive effort in promoting government by and for the people . - peter , us this is obviously a sick man with a need to feel special and garner attention .
he is probably paid off by russia or china to make the us look bad , because we finally have an intelligent president , and these countries ca n't stand it .
bush did n't need wikileaks ... he screwed up on his own .
assange is easy to diffuse - just create 10 carbon copy wikileaks sites with fake data .
nobody will know who to believe , and -lsb- assange -rsb- will not have as much interest in causing trouble anymore , because he will not feel special . - dan , us julian assange is a hero and putting his life at risk for mankind and the survival of the species by way of information and awareness correction like a correction in the stock markets .
unfortunately he has awakened a giant bear , and it 's coming after him , and his life will never be the same .
he is a real warrior , not a faceless creature hiding behind created authority . - lien , germany in my opinion , julian assange should not be the target of any legal action .
what is amazing is that interpol has many real threats to humanity such as dictators like fidel , raul castro and others .
please support a person who combats wrongdoing whatever the government affected . - liborio , cuba us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts should the us prosecute julian assange ?
no , assange was only trying to show how much hypocrisy is in the world of diplomacy and military blunder .
he should be praised for his courage . - g. , canada a lot of americans have worked hard to repair relations with germany after the iraq war .
i have reviewed the laws with several lawyers and it seems near impossible to prosecute julian assange at this time .
he really set our collective efforts back several years .
it 's very disparaging to read the german newspapers lately , and my heart sinks how far these leaks have set our relations back .
it 's a sad day here in america to see my friends in germany so upset . - stephen , us why ?
he did n't spy and he did n't steal .
the information was passed on to wikileaks by an american citizen , and assange accepted it .
the us was caught with its pants down , and now it 'll try every dirty trick in the book to find fault somewhere else ... except with itself . - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 03.12.2010 lufthansa offers broadband internet again on transatlantic flights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa 's transatlantic passengers can send emails to those on the ground lufthansa 's transatlantic passengers with laptops and smartphones can now surf the internet in midair .
voice chats are n't permitted , but there 's no telling what sites passengers might visit . passengers on board transatlantic lufthansa flights , flying high in the sky , can now stay connected to the rest of the world via wireless broadband internet connections .
the airline began offering its flynet service on dec .
1 , with connections fast enough to watch videos and play online games .
although internet telephony services such as skype are not blocked , their use wo n't be permitted .
in the spring of 2011 , the company will also make mobile phone technology available for text messaging and wireless data transfer via smart phones .
lufthansa had offered the same service through connexion by boeing in 2003 but stopped in 2006 when boeing discontinued the service .
at the time , the service was used by some 30,000 passengers per month .
lufthansa press speaker boris ogursky said boeing apparently did not see the service as economically viable at the time .
" we found that to be very unfortunate , " he told deutsche welle .
" but at the time , it was clear to us – and it was clear fairly quickly – that we wanted to find a way to offer a similar service .
from our perspective , the experience was positive . "
more internet-capable devices than ever ogursky said lufthansa decided to offer the flynet service because of the benefit to customers - and to the airline .
" the fact that we offer -lrb- broadband -rrb- internet access sets us apart ... and we hope that we will be able to increase demand this way , " he said , adding that " now significantly more customers have a device capable of connecting to a wireless lan . "
according deutsche bank research analyst eric heymann , the proliferation of smartphones makes the economics of in-flight internet more viable than it was in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panasonic 's margis and lufthansa 's mayrhuber shook on the deal in 2009 " the increasing use of smartphones and other mobile devices will speed this development up , " he told deutsche welle .
" at any rate , such devices are a very clear step in the direction of mobile internet use in general . "
available to all passengers lufthansa 's ogursky said flynet is available " not just in the premium classes ; every passenger on board a -lrb- transatlantic -rrb- long-distance flight will be able to use this service . "
the fee is 10.95 euros for one hour and 19.95 euros for 24 hours .
ogursky also said the company 's decision not to permit internet telephony was based on customer surveys that indicated many would not be in favor of the move .
by comparison , deutsche bahn , which offers internet access currently in 72 high-speed ice trains , permits mobile phone conversations on board .
analyst heymann , however , sides with lufthansa .
" in business travel , some people enjoy that they are n't available for a while , " he said .
" it 's sort of the last mobile-phone-free zone . "
flynet is offered through panasonic avionics corporation and uses the payment system of deutsche telekom .
the deutsche telekom payment system can be used with a network of 8,000 hotspots throughout germany .

voice chats are n't permitted , but there 's no telling what sites passengers might visit . passengers on board transatlantic lufthansa flights , flying high in the sky , can now stay connected to the rest of the world via wireless broadband internet connections .
the airline began offering its flynet service on dec .
1 , with connections fast enough to watch videos and play online games .
although internet telephony services such as skype are not blocked , their use wo n't be permitted .
in the spring of 2011 , the company will also make mobile phone technology available for text messaging and wireless data transfer via smart phones .
lufthansa had offered the same service through connexion by boeing in 2003 but stopped in 2006 when boeing discontinued the service .
at the time , the service was used by some 30,000 passengers per month .
lufthansa press speaker boris ogursky said boeing apparently did not see the service as economically viable at the time .
" we found that to be very unfortunate , " he told deutsche welle .
" but at the time , it was clear to us – and it was clear fairly quickly – that we wanted to find a way to offer a similar service .
from our perspective , the experience was positive . "
more internet-capable devices than ever ogursky said lufthansa decided to offer the flynet service because of the benefit to customers - and to the airline .
" the fact that we offer -lrb- broadband -rrb- internet access sets us apart ... and we hope that we will be able to increase demand this way , " he said , adding that " now significantly more customers have a device capable of connecting to a wireless lan . "
according deutsche bank research analyst eric heymann , the proliferation of smartphones makes the economics of in-flight internet more viable than it was in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panasonic 's margis and lufthansa 's mayrhuber shook on the deal in 2009 " the increasing use of smartphones and other mobile devices will speed this development up , " he told deutsche welle .
" at any rate , such devices are a very clear step in the direction of mobile internet use in general . "
available to all passengers lufthansa 's ogursky said flynet is available " not just in the premium classes ; every passenger on board a -lrb- transatlantic -rrb- long-distance flight will be able to use this service . "
the fee is 10.95 euros for one hour and 19.95 euros for 24 hours .
ogursky also said the company 's decision not to permit internet telephony was based on customer surveys that indicated many would not be in favor of the move .
by comparison , deutsche bahn , which offers internet access currently in 72 high-speed ice trains , permits mobile phone conversations on board .
analyst heymann , however , sides with lufthansa .
" in business travel , some people enjoy that they are n't available for a while , " he said .
" it 's sort of the last mobile-phone-free zone . "
flynet is offered through panasonic avionics corporation and uses the payment system of deutsche telekom .
the deutsche telekom payment system can be used with a network of 8,000 hotspots throughout germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 03.12.2010 us diplomats saw german inexperience in bruno the bear 's tale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us consul general in munich read a lot into bruno 's story ' nature is good , as long as it is controlled , channeled and subdued . '
that was the us assessment of attitudes in germany and bavaria after an undocumented immigrant , a brown bear named bruno , briefly sought a new home . in one of the lighter diplomatic cables unveiled by wikileaks , it seems the us consulate in munich took considerable interest in one of bavaria 's most ill-fated immigrants - a brown bear given the name bruno .
bruno was part of a scheme to reintroduce wild bears from slovenia into the alps .
via italy and austria , he made his way to germany and was first sighted on may 20 , 2006 .
his stay was a short but eventful one , before he died at the barrel of a gun .
" as the first wild bear seen in germany since 1835 , bruno was initially extended a warm public welcome by -lsb- then -rsb- bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf , " the rather light-hearted missive to washington , signed by the former us consul general to munich , matthew rooney , recalled .
" after all , bruno could prove a boon for bavaria 's image just as visitors from around the world arrived for the world cup . "
the state premier at the time , edmund stoiber , also quickly welcomed bruno to the country , but even this gesture of friendship carried an underlying threat .
" a bear that behaves normally lives in the woods , never leaves , and snatches perhaps one or two sheep each year , " stoiber said , trying to reassure people that bruno posed no threat .
" however , as -lsb- then -rsb- bavarian interior minister -lsb- guenther -rsb- beckstein has often emphasized , foreigners are only welcome in bavaria provided they are willing to adapt to german culture and traditions , " the diplomatic message to washington cautioned with the benefit of hindsight .
' the problem bear ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno 's appetite for livestock and bold behavior made him ' ursus non grata ' bruno proved smarter than stoiber 's average bear - or rather , more troublesome .
before long , he was spied raiding stables , killing sheep , chickens , and even a child 's pet rabbit , and the us diplomat recalled how he quickly became " ursus non grata . "
" vexed by bruno 's unchecked roaming across bavaria - he was even seen sitting on the steps of a police station eating a guinea pig - -lsb- state premier -rsb- edmund stoiber took to referring to him as ' the problem bear . " '
after weeks of being germany 's new poster boy , suddenly bruno was wanted , dead or alive .
but the government 's shoot-to-kill order met considerable resistance from the public ; letters poured in to the environment minister from children around the country calling for him to spare bruno .
seeking to avoid a public outcry , the bavarian government spent at least 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 165,000 -rrb- to fly in a special bear trap from the us and trained hunters with dogs from finland .
yet these efforts did not bear fruit , and on june 26 hunting season was declared open once again .
bruno was shot dead before lunchtime .
consul general rooney notes that spiegel online likened bruno 's death with that of elvis , marilyn monroe , jimi hendrix , john lennon , and princess diana .
the online portal of der spiegel magazine , which cooperated with wikileaks in releasing the cables , was also the first to publish rooney 's comments on bruno in germany .
' modern germany … coexists uneasily with untamed nature ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' bruno the bear - shot dead by dastardly murderers on june 26 , 2006 , ' the memorial reads the initial backlash to bruno 's demise was fierce , with death threats leveled against then environment minister schnappauf and the hunter who shot the brown bear .
despite this , the us consul general in munich told his bosses in washington to expect any fallout to be " relatively fleeting , " also noting in a humorously understated manner that radical animal rights activists who make death threats are n't exactly considered the base of the christian , conservative csu party ruling the state .
" perhaps the greatest insight from the whole bruno affair might be that despite the veneer of ' greenness ' extolled by german society , modern germany in fact coexists rather uneasily with untamed nature , " rooney posited .
" true wilderness , even in mountainous bavaria , has n't really existed in germany for generations - nature is good , as long as it is controlled , channeled , subdued . "
bruno was the last known brown bear to enter the german alps .
the message to washington - which was coordinated with the us embassy in berlin - concluded that any endeavor to repopulate the region with wild creatures would probably be pointless .
" if the saga of bavaria 's ' problem bear ' is any indicator , the strategy of reintroducing wild bears to the alps , at least the german alps , may be doomed to failure - that is , unless the bears are willing to cooperate by not being too wild . "

there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

the lawyer heading up the investigation , marion westpfahl , said at a press conference on friday that the available records pointed to huge gaps in the documentation between 1945 and 2009 .
she added this hinted strongly at a " systematic system of cover-up , " in which few abuse cases were criminally prosecuted .
" only 26 priests were convicted for sexual offences , " westpfahl explained to reporters , saying she found 365 files containing evidence that " acts of abuse had taken place in an almost commonplace manner . "
" we have to assume that there is a large unknown number -lsb- of abuse cases -rsb- , " she said .
" we are dealing with the extensive destruction of files . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich and freising archdiocese was run by the current pope in his younger days the incriminating evidence westpfahl found among 13,200 available files implicated 159 priests , 15 deacons , 96 religion teachers and six pastoral employees , with rural areas particularly affected .
the victims ' suffering often remained a mystery , she said , as the reports usually discussed abuse in coy euphemisms .
details sketchy on papal era westpfahl also said that the period of 1977 to 1982 , when pope benedikt xvi - then archbishop josef ratzinger - headed up the archdiocese , was particularly poorly documented .
in this timeframe , she only found one document , regarding an abuse case .
ratzinger had dealt with the case himself , ordering that an abusive priest be removed from his parish , she said .
westpfahl praised the church for giving her free reign in her research , a task to which she was assigned by current archbishop reinhard marx .
" for me , these were surely the worst months of my life , " marx told reporters on friday .
" i felt shame , grief and dismay .
as a church , we ask forgiveness for those things done by our church employees . "
the archdiocese of munich and freising was one of the worst hit in germany during the wave of abuse accusations that swept across much of europe in 2009 , and westpfahl 's report was commissioned in response to the allegations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 03.12.2010 no euphoria in russia over most expensive soccer championship ever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many russian people have their eyes on the bill , not the ball russian soccer fans have welcomed fifa 's decision to give the 2018 world cup to russia .
but many russians fear that the financial burden may be too high . in the streets of moscow and elsewhere in russia there were no signs of euphoria following fifa 's decision to grant the 2018 world cup to russia .
the public reaction appeared to be rather subdued compared to the outpouring of joy three years ago , when russia secured the 2014 winter olympics .
even though soccer is one of russia 's most popular sports , many russians say they never really cared whether the championship would take place in russia or elsewhere .
part of this wariness may be explained by worries over the actual cost of the event for russian taxpayers .
as experience with the preparations of the winter games in sochi has shown , the ultimate expenses may well be far higher than originally planned . more than three years before the curtain-raiser , it is already clear the games in sochi will be the most expensive ever .
the same was true for the eurovision song contest held last year in moscow .
and many observers are already convinced that the 2018 world cup will be the most costly in history .
with the short-lived euphoria over fifa 's decision over , reality has sunk in quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir putin -lrb- r . -rrb- says people are exaggerating the potential costs prime minister vladimir putin denied the costs would be too high during his press conference in zurich late on thursday , hours after fifa had announced its decision .
" according to preliminary calculations , the construction of stadiums and adjacent infrastructure will cost us around $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.6 million euros -rrb- , comparable to what was spent on the championship in south africa , " he said .
besides , he argued , part of the work was already underway and would be financed by large companies like russia 's gas monopoly gazprom , the oil company lukoil , and others .
also , he joked , russian billionaire and chelsea owner roman abramovich " has a lot of money " and will certainly want to help out financially .
all that , said putin , means that the ultimate cost might even be lower than current estimates .
on the heels of that statement , finance minister aleksei kudrin was quick to announce that the cost of the soccer championship would likely be lower than that of the winter olympics in sochi , without mentioning figures .
but critics in russia question the official calculations and point out that total investments must be well higher , given that russia not only needs to build 13 brand new stadiums in the coming seven years , but also create a huge infrastructure that does not exist today .
dozens of large and hundreds of small hotels must be erected in moscow and elsewhere to house the hundreds of thousands of football fans during the tournament .
for the hotels alone an estimated $ 11 billion will be required .
almost 10,000 kilometers -lrb- 6,200 miles -rrb- of new roads will have to be built , costing over $ 35 billion .
many railway stations and airports need to be completely renovated .
all this represents a truly daunting task for any country , but it 's a unique challenge in today 's russia , where all this work must be carried out alongside the ongoing preparations for the winter games in sochi .
one-off costs , long-term gains ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia must now prepare for two major global sports competitions the russian government emphasizes that many of the impending infrastructural projects " would have been carried out anyway , " only at a later stage .
the world cup will simply speed things up , they argue , presenting the extra costs connected with the football tournament as a long-term investment in the development of the country as a whole .
" russia is rising , " said putin in zurich .
" and in 2018 it will be even stronger . "
corruption may be another problem .
traditionally in russia large building projects , be it roads or football stadiums , are often much more expensive from the onset than similar projects in other countries .
this is usually because large amounts of money are siphoned off by state officials involved in the project .
the kremlin is well aware of the problem , judging by the apt exclamation on twitter of presidential aide arkady dvorkovich : " let 's do it without kickbacks . "
this was more likely a serious appeal than a humorous " tweet " in a country where corruption is rampant and still on the rise , according to the anti-corruption watchdog transparency international .

aid groups are opposed to the idea .
is there room for compromise ? military and civilian organizations , on the ground together in crisis regions around the world , should learn to work together more closely , said german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting earlier this week in berlin .
guttenberg told a parliamentary party congress of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , that both nonprofit aid organizations and the military needed to create a " culture of mutual trust " and cooperation , and show a more unified face to the outside world .
a question of integrity yet this type of cooperation is highly controversial .
while proponents say it puts a more unified and decisive face on german activities abroad , those opposed - such as many humanitarian aid groups who are present on the ground - say it could easily compromise their integrity and independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers have close contact to the afghan population the berlin panel , including guttenberg , discussed in depth the complex topic based on the recommendations of a cdu / csu position paper , " civil-military cooperation - an alliance for the future ? "
guttenberg acknowledged that there were prejudices on both sides of the issue .
yet he said the question was not whether , but how , the military and civic groups should work together .
umbrella group is strictly opposed according to guttenberg , the main ingredient missing for better cooperation is nerve .
his party needs to be more forceful in getting its message across , he said .
" sometimes we are afraid of our own shadow , because we think there could be unpleasant realities tied to our actions , " guttenberg said .
suzana lipovac , head of international programs at the german aid organization kinderberg international , said there were pros and cons to such cooperation .
on the one hand , years of experience had taught her the importance of being pragmatic about the use of resources .
on the other hand , she questioned the wisdom of working closely together with the military in places where that might be seen as detrimental - for example , in afghanistan .
meeting with the taliban there , her organization takes part in large public meetings that may also be attended by enemies of allied troops .
her project could not exist without these meetings , where afghan village elders , imams - and also , sometimes , taliban - meet , lipovac said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr was part of eufor troops in bosnia and herzegovina but since the aim of her humanitarian work was to help reach the millennium development goals - namely , to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates - the most important thing was getting help , wherever it could be found , she said .
however , lipovac said she has benefited from the help of german soldiers in bosnia , where the german army , or bundeswehr , was not seen as an occupying force .
lipovac said a study showed refugees in bosnian camps ranked physical security ahead of food , medical aid , or even a bottle of water .
the military can provide what aid groups can not yet safety was something that aid groups in crisis regions could n't provide , she noted .
soldiers were often needed to create a situation where humanitarian aid could be applied .
" and then we could provide that aid , " lipovac said .
but venro , an umbrella group for german development ngos , rejects out of hand the idea of working together with troops - be they german or from other countries .
robert lindner , venro 's afghanistan spokesman , warned against such cooperation , whether it be in regions with heavy or light fighting , or even where there are few projects , such as day kundi , afghanistan .
putting aid workers in danger military rebuilding specialists - so called provincial reconstruction teams , or prts - do not belong there at all , lindner said .
bringing them there would only endanger the lives of civilian aid workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is working on plans to restructure the german military " in day kundi , there are local authorities who have said ' please no projects by prts .
we know that it 's harmful to us ' and i think we should listen to the wishes of the local people in afghanistan . "
brigadier general frank leidenberger , who has had many years of experience in afghanistan , admitted that the bundeswehr had done things wrong in the past and said the connection between humanitarian and military work had yet to be made clear .
yet he acknowledged that no one has really been put in charge of connecting the two parties .
" we have definitely made mistakes , " leidenberger told the berlin panel .
" we have done operations because the civil-humanitarian situation , and the connection to development agencies , was n't clear enough .
i have to assume that , i ca n't say so exactly , because there was no one to talk to me about it . "
collateral security concept with the concept of so-called collateral security , the north atlantic treaty organization has learned what it believes are necessary lessons for further afghanistan engagement .
a broad array of instruments are necessary for conflict and crisis management , defense minister guttenberg said : diplomatic , political , economic , developmental , policing - and sometimes even military .
a change in strategy from purely putting down uprisings to offering more protection for populations was " very , very late in coming , " the minister said .
precious time had been lost , yet germany had " at least come a little bit farther " in its role as a security ally , he said .
as to guttenberg 's concept of civilian-military cooperation , brigadier general leidenberger said there was " no alternative . "

national fire chief shimon romach said on friday that teams were " far from bringing it under control . "
international planes and helicopters swooped over the israeli woodland , dumping seawater on the flames as israel 's fire service was overwhelmed by the blazes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 03.12.2010 opinion : 2018 world cup will force russia to modernize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is widespread in russia and the country is not a democracy based on the rule of law , but that does n't mean the country is a bad choice for the world cup , says deutsche welle 's ingo mannteufel . the 2018 fifa world cup is set to be held in russia .
being chosen as the host country is the crowning achievement of a consistent strategy coming out of moscow .
by campaigning for major international sporting events , the russian leadership - particularly the powerful prime minister vladimir putin - is hoping to improve the image of russia abroad .
in 2007 putin snagged the 2014 winter olympics for sochi on the russian black sea coast .
and just a few weeks ago he got the go-ahead for a russian formula 1 grand prix event - also in sochi - beginning in 2014 .
and now it 's been chosen to host the world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel , head of dw 's russian service that prime minister putin will spare no money or trouble to better his country 's image in the world must be seen critically .
the russia of today that he has created is far from a democratic state .
and there 's a real danger that much of money provided for these megaprojects could disappear into corrupt companies and government bodies .
and of course 13 of the 16 planned match stadiums will have to be built new or completely remodeled .
it will also be a tremendous effort to improve the tourism infrastructure to accommodate the thousands of fans and manage the logistics of the long distances between the venues .
the question of how much the environment will be taken into account also remains open .
the experience with the construction work in sochi would suggest we should n't get our hopes up .
nevertheless the decision by fifa to hold the world cup , for the first time in its history , in eastern europe is a good one .
the world cup is a massive celebration of sports fans in a " global village . "
it 's not just the opportunity for cultural exchange .
rather it actually forces the host nation and its international guests to get to know each other .
hundreds of thousands of fans will stream into eastern europe and especially russia in the next decade to discover this part of europe for themselves .
in 2012 the european championship is to be held in poland and ukraine ; in 2014 the winter olympics are in sochi and now in 2018 the world cup will be held in 13 russian cities that most people in europe have never heard of .
who in western europe has heard of saransk or yaroslavl ?
this will put a lot of pressure on the russian government to really modernize and europeanize russia , so that visitors take a positive impression of the country back with them when they return home .
being chosen as the host for the world cup is good for a country 's image at least until the first whistle blows and the tournament begins .
then the host nation will have to deliver on its promises if it does n't want to lose its credibility in the eyes of thousands of guests and the rest of the world .
russia will have to change in the next several years , perhaps more than putin and the other ruling elite would like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 03.12.2010 lufthansa offers broadband internet again on transatlantic flights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa 's transatlantic passengers can send emails to those on the ground lufthansa 's transatlantic passengers with laptops and smartphones can now surf the internet in midair .
voice chats are n't permitted , but there 's no telling what sites passengers might visit . passengers on board transatlantic lufthansa flights , flying high in the sky , can now stay connected to the rest of the world via wireless broadband internet connections .
the airline began offering its flynet service on dec .
1 , with connections fast enough to watch videos and play online games .
although internet telephony services such as skype are not blocked , their use wo n't be permitted .
in the spring of 2011 , the company will also make mobile phone technology available for text messaging and wireless data transfer via smart phones .
lufthansa had offered the same service through connexion by boeing in 2003 but stopped in 2006 when boeing discontinued the service .
at the time , the service was used by some 30,000 passengers per month .
lufthansa press speaker boris ogursky said boeing apparently did not see the service as economically viable at the time .
" we found that to be very unfortunate , " he told deutsche welle .
" but at the time , it was clear to us – and it was clear fairly quickly – that we wanted to find a way to offer a similar service .
from our perspective , the experience was positive . "
more internet-capable devices than ever ogursky said lufthansa decided to offer the flynet service because of the benefit to customers - and to the airline .
" the fact that we offer -lrb- broadband -rrb- internet access sets us apart ... and we hope that we will be able to increase demand this way , " he said , adding that " now significantly more customers have a device capable of connecting to a wireless lan . "
according deutsche bank research analyst eric heymann , the proliferation of smartphones makes the economics of in-flight internet more viable than it was in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panasonic 's margis and lufthansa 's mayrhuber shook on the deal in 2009 " the increasing use of smartphones and other mobile devices will speed this development up , " he told deutsche welle .
" at any rate , such devices are a very clear step in the direction of mobile internet use in general . "
available to all passengers lufthansa 's ogursky said flynet is available " not just in the premium classes ; every passenger on board a -lrb- transatlantic -rrb- long-distance flight will be able to use this service . "
the fee is 10.95 euros for one hour and 19.95 euros for 24 hours .
ogursky also said the company 's decision not to permit internet telephony was based on customer surveys that indicated many would not be in favor of the move .
by comparison , deutsche bahn , which offers internet access currently in 72 high-speed ice trains , permits mobile phone conversations on board .
analyst heymann , however , sides with lufthansa .
" in business travel , some people enjoy that they are n't available for a while , " he said .
" it 's sort of the last mobile-phone-free zone . "
flynet is offered through panasonic avionics corporation and uses the payment system of deutsche telekom .
the deutsche telekom payment system can be used with a network of 8,000 hotspots throughout germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

i support the man behind the wikileaks for bringing this information out .
they are right for putting the truth out for the world to know .
hopefully this kind of open government can catch on and it will mean more peace through communication and understanding . - bruce , us we will never know who is really behind julian assange .
we live in the times of such disinformation that this is an enigmatic affair of our global village . - agatha , canada he should be as afraid of the us as when somebody blows the whistle on a drug baron or a mafia boss . - alberto , great britain my opinion is that wikileaks is making a very constructive effort in promoting government by and for the people . - peter , us this is obviously a sick man with a need to feel special and garner attention .
he is probably paid off by russia or china to make the us look bad , because we finally have an intelligent president , and these countries ca n't stand it .
bush did n't need wikileaks ... he screwed up on his own .
assange is easy to diffuse - just create 10 carbon copy wikileaks sites with fake data .
nobody will know who to believe , and -lsb- assange -rsb- will not have as much interest in causing trouble anymore , because he will not feel special . - dan , us julian assange is a hero and putting his life at risk for mankind and the survival of the species by way of information and awareness correction like a correction in the stock markets .
unfortunately he has awakened a giant bear , and it 's coming after him , and his life will never be the same .
he is a real warrior , not a faceless creature hiding behind created authority . - lien , germany in my opinion , julian assange should not be the target of any legal action .
what is amazing is that interpol has many real threats to humanity such as dictators like fidel , raul castro and others .
please support a person who combats wrongdoing whatever the government affected . - liborio , cuba us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts should the us prosecute julian assange ?
no , assange was only trying to show how much hypocrisy is in the world of diplomacy and military blunder .
he should be praised for his courage . - g. , canada a lot of americans have worked hard to repair relations with germany after the iraq war .
i have reviewed the laws with several lawyers and it seems near impossible to prosecute julian assange at this time .
he really set our collective efforts back several years .
it 's very disparaging to read the german newspapers lately , and my heart sinks how far these leaks have set our relations back .
it 's a sad day here in america to see my friends in germany so upset . - stephen , us why ?
he did n't spy and he did n't steal .
the information was passed on to wikileaks by an american citizen , and assange accepted it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 03.12.2010 german boardrooms remain a man 's domain - for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are underrepresented in german top management the green party has received a mixed response from all sides for its aim of setting a legal quota for top management posts .
there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

ngos and activists recently met in berlin to assess the situation as winter sets in . muhammad idrees kamal has fought poverty for many years and is currently the executive director of an ngo based in peshawar called citizens rights and sustainable development . his home village was hit at the end of july and he has been working relentlessly to help those affected by the floods ever since .
he thinks a different approach to administering aid is necessary . " some countries are providing food and other relief goods but this is not enough to solve the problem , " he said in berlin . houses need to be reconstructed and people 's livelihoods need to be restored , " otherwise the crisis after the crisis will emerge , " he pointed out . threat of islamism the pakistani military is the only institution which so far has really been able to work on a large scale and in a systematic manner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most pressing problems is reconstruction some observers say that generals have been cooperating with islamist militants , who were the first to provide unofficial help when the floods began .
there was some concern in the west that the islamists could make political gains as a result . ayesha siddiqa , a journalist based in pakistan 's capital islamabad , shares the concern to some extent .
" because of the combination of poverty and the militants ’ better media management there is a potential threat of people falling victim to them . " reassessing people 's needs siddiqa added that people ’ s needs had to be reassessed .
" there are threats , which pakistan 's civil society must address , but there are other things , which it can only solve with the help of the international community , " she explained . another reason for the international community 's dilemma concerning how to help pakistan ’ s flood victims has been the general fear that aid money could end up in the pockets of corrupt politicians . siddiqa argued that the west should have a more pragmatic approach .
" corruption and inefficiency do not make us happy but they are problems which will be reduced once democratic governments realize they have to take responsibility for their actions . " " it is important to understand that these democratic forces are our only hope .
we have to create monitoring and evaluation methods to keep an eye on them , " she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are still millions of people living in camps for displaced persons strengthening civil society thomas gebauer , the executive director of the german relief organization , medico international , supported this line of thought and said that civil society in pakistan had to be strengthened . " these people are not only important because they can implement aid programs and administer emergency aid but because they have a monitoring function when it comes to larger projects , " he said . as winter sets in and life gets even tougher for many of the flood victims , ngos and experts have called for a coordinated approach to administering aid . author : cem sey editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no crisis for the euro as a currency , " trichet said friday in a radio interview on france 's rtl radio network .
" we have problems of financial instability that are the result of budget crises in certain european countries . "
essential for investor confidence trichet added that the central bank has the " same message " for all countries - namely , to " take all measures to make next year 's fiscal objectives credible . "
he said such action is essential for investor confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 03.12.2010 us diplomats saw german inexperience in bruno the bear 's tale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us consul general in munich read a lot into bruno 's story ' nature is good , as long as it is controlled , channeled and subdued . '
that was the us assessment of attitudes in germany and bavaria after an undocumented immigrant , a brown bear named bruno , briefly sought a new home . in one of the lighter diplomatic cables unveiled by wikileaks , it seems the us consulate in munich took considerable interest in one of bavaria 's most ill-fated immigrants - a brown bear given the name bruno .
bruno was part of a scheme to reintroduce wild bears from slovenia into the alps .
via italy and austria , he made his way to germany and was first sighted on may 20 , 2006 .
his stay was a short but eventful one , before he died at the barrel of a gun .
" as the first wild bear seen in germany since 1835 , bruno was initially extended a warm public welcome by -lsb- then -rsb- bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf , " the rather light-hearted missive to washington , signed by the former us consul general to munich , matthew rooney , recalled .
" after all , bruno could prove a boon for bavaria 's image just as visitors from around the world arrived for the world cup . "
the state premier at the time , edmund stoiber , also quickly welcomed bruno to the country , but even this gesture of friendship carried an underlying threat .
" a bear that behaves normally lives in the woods , never leaves , and snatches perhaps one or two sheep each year , " stoiber said , trying to reassure people that bruno posed no threat .
" however , as -lsb- then -rsb- bavarian interior minister -lsb- guenther -rsb- beckstein has often emphasized , foreigners are only welcome in bavaria provided they are willing to adapt to german culture and traditions , " the diplomatic message to washington cautioned with the benefit of hindsight .
' the problem bear ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno 's appetite for livestock and bold behavior made him ' ursus non grata ' bruno proved smarter than stoiber 's average bear - or rather , more troublesome .
before long , he was spied raiding stables , killing sheep , chickens , and even a child 's pet rabbit , and the us diplomat recalled how he quickly became " ursus non grata . "
" vexed by bruno 's unchecked roaming across bavaria - he was even seen sitting on the steps of a police station eating a guinea pig - -lsb- state premier -rsb- edmund stoiber took to referring to him as ' the problem bear . " '
after weeks of being germany 's new poster boy , suddenly bruno was wanted , dead or alive .
but the government 's shoot-to-kill order met considerable resistance from the public ; letters poured in to the environment minister from children around the country calling for him to spare bruno .
seeking to avoid a public outcry , the bavarian government spent at least 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 165,000 -rrb- to fly in a special bear trap from the us and trained hunters with dogs from finland .
yet these efforts did not bear fruit , and on june 26 hunting season was declared open once again .
bruno was shot dead before lunchtime .
consul general rooney notes that spiegel online likened bruno 's death with that of elvis , marilyn monroe , jimi hendrix , john lennon , and princess diana .
the online portal of der spiegel magazine , which cooperated with wikileaks in releasing the cables , was also the first to publish rooney 's comments on bruno in germany .
' modern germany … coexists uneasily with untamed nature ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' bruno the bear - shot dead by dastardly murderers on june 26 , 2006 , ' the memorial reads the initial backlash to bruno 's demise was fierce , with death threats leveled against then environment minister schnappauf and the hunter who shot the brown bear .
despite this , the us consul general in munich told his bosses in washington to expect any fallout to be " relatively fleeting , " also noting in a humorously understated manner that radical animal rights activists who make death threats are n't exactly considered the base of the christian , conservative csu party ruling the state .
" perhaps the greatest insight from the whole bruno affair might be that despite the veneer of ' greenness ' extolled by german society , modern germany in fact coexists rather uneasily with untamed nature , " rooney posited .
" true wilderness , even in mountainous bavaria , has n't really existed in germany for generations - nature is good , as long as it is controlled , channeled , subdued . "
bruno was the last known brown bear to enter the german alps .
the message to washington - which was coordinated with the us embassy in berlin - concluded that any endeavor to repopulate the region with wild creatures would probably be pointless .
" if the saga of bavaria 's ' problem bear ' is any indicator , the strategy of reintroducing wild bears to the alps , at least the german alps , may be doomed to failure - that is , unless the bears are willing to cooperate by not being too wild . "

the first half of their match on friday against fellow promoted side kaiserslautern was marked by a lack of highlights from the evenly matched teams .
both teams struggled on the slippery , snowy pitch in hamburg , however when they had chances , they failed to capitalize .
shortly after the break , st. pauli got on the board when kaiserslautern 's christian tiffert inadvertently headed the ball into his own team 's goal .
the score provided the impetus for both clubs to open up the game more , but st. pauli held off the visitors to grab three important points .
both teams now have 17 points , but still remain near the bottom of the table .

it caps off a record-warm decade that is a new indication of the man-made climate change that delegates at the cancun climate change conference hope to curb , according to the un weather and climate body behind the report , the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- .
" the trend is of very significant warming , " wmo secretary-general michel jarraud told a news conference on the cancun conference sidelines .
he said 2010 so far was slightly warmer than both 1998 and 2005 , the previous two hottest years , but could slip once november and december records are included .
global temperature records show this year has been half a degree warmer than a 1961-1990 annual average of 14 degrees celsius .
" there is a significant possibility that 2010 could be the warmest year , " jarraud said .
a final ranking for 2010 is due to be published early in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early snowfall this year has wreaked havoc across germany and europe winter comes early in europe the report coincided with a cold snap across northern europe , where snowfall has caused travel chaos .
in germany , berlin woke up on friday to nine centimeters of snow and temperatures of -6 degrees celsius , with even deeper snow in other parts of the country .
" generally germany does fit the -lrb- wmo-reported -rrb- trend if we look at the past 100 years or so , but this year it did not .
so far germany has experienced its coolest year since 1996 , " gerhard mueller-westermeier , an expert from the german meteorological service , told deutsche welle .
on average , mueller-westermeier said , 2010 has so far been a cold year across central europe , though he pointed out that the region represents only a small proportion of global land and sea surface temperatures and records here do not invalidate the wmo report .
sign of things to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiators at the un climate conference in cancun are hoping for success wmo head michel jarraud said the changes reflected in his organization 's report were new evidence that human emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels were warming the climate , and that he hoped the findings would guide negotiators at the cancun conference .
" if nothing is done ... -lrb- temperatures -rrb- will go up and up , " he said .
" this is yet another warning from the planet that it is feeling the heat , " said greenpeace international climate policy director wendel trio .
" will governments take this warning and take the opportunity to act ? or will they continue to delay action and accept more warming , year after year ? "
the cancun conference continues until december 10 .

it caps off a record-warm decade that is a new indication of the man-made climate change that delegates at the cancun climate change conference hope to curb , according to the un weather and climate body behind the report , the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- .
" the trend is of very significant warming , " wmo secretary-general michel jarraud told a news conference on the cancun conference sidelines .
he said 2010 so far was slightly warmer than both 1998 and 2005 , the previous two hottest years , but could slip once november and december records are included .
global temperature records show this year has been half a degree warmer than a 1961-1990 annual average of 14 degrees celsius .
" there is a significant possibility that 2010 could be the warmest year , " jarraud said .
a final ranking for 2010 is due to be published early in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early snowfall this year has wreaked havoc across germany and europe winter comes early in europe the report coincided with a cold snap across northern europe , where snowfall has caused travel chaos .
in germany , berlin woke up on friday to nine centimeters of snow and temperatures of -6 degrees celsius , with even deeper snow in other parts of the country .
" generally germany does fit the -lrb- wmo-reported -rrb- trend if we look at the past 100 years or so , but this year it did not .
so far germany has experienced its coolest year since 1996 , " gerhard mueller-westermeier , an expert from the german meteorological service , told deutsche welle .
on average , mueller-westermeier said , 2010 has so far been a cold year across central europe , though he pointed out that the region represents only a small proportion of global land and sea surface temperatures and records here do not invalidate the wmo report .
sign of things to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiators at the un climate conference in cancun are hoping for success wmo head michel jarraud said the changes reflected in his organization 's report were new evidence that human emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels were warming the climate , and that he hoped the findings would guide negotiators at the cancun conference .
" if nothing is done ... -lrb- temperatures -rrb- will go up and up , " he said .
" this is yet another warning from the planet that it is feeling the heat , " said greenpeace international climate policy director wendel trio .
" will governments take this warning and take the opportunity to act ? or will they continue to delay action and accept more warming , year after year ? "
the cancun conference continues until december 10 .

the lawyer heading up the investigation , marion westpfahl , said at a press conference on friday that the available records pointed to huge gaps in the documentation between 1945 and 2009 .
she added this hinted strongly at a " systematic system of cover-up , " in which few abuse cases were criminally prosecuted .
" only 26 priests were convicted for sexual offences , " westpfahl explained to reporters , saying she found 365 files containing evidence that " acts of abuse had taken place in an almost commonplace manner . "
" we have to assume that there is a large unknown number -lsb- of abuse cases -rsb- , " she said .
" we are dealing with the extensive destruction of files . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich and freising archdiocese was run by the current pope in his younger days the incriminating evidence westpfahl found among 13,200 available files implicated 159 priests , 15 deacons , 96 religion teachers and six pastoral employees , with rural areas particularly affected .
the victims ' suffering often remained a mystery , she said , as the reports usually discussed abuse in coy euphemisms .
details sketchy on papal era westpfahl also said that the period of 1977 to 1982 , when pope benedikt xvi - then archbishop josef ratzinger - headed up the archdiocese , was particularly poorly documented .
in this timeframe , she only found one document , regarding an abuse case .
ratzinger had dealt with the case himself , ordering that an abusive priest be removed from his parish , she said .
westpfahl praised the church for giving her free reign in her research , a task to which she was assigned by current archbishop reinhard marx .
" for me , these were surely the worst months of my life , " marx told reporters on friday .
" i felt shame , grief and dismay .
as a church , we ask forgiveness for those things done by our church employees . "
the archdiocese of munich and freising was one of the worst hit in germany during the wave of abuse accusations that swept across much of europe in 2009 , and westpfahl 's report was commissioned in response to the allegations .

there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

" there is no crisis for the euro as a currency , " trichet said friday in a radio interview on france 's rtl radio network .
" we have problems of financial instability that are the result of budget crises in certain european countries . "
essential for investor confidence trichet added that the central bank has the " same message " for all countries - namely , to " take all measures to make next year 's fiscal objectives credible . "
he said such action is essential for investor confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

unfortunately he has awakened a giant bear , and it 's coming after him , and his life will never be the same .
he is a real warrior , not a faceless creature hiding behind created authority . - lien , germany in my opinion , julian assange should not be the target of any legal action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 03.12.2010 german boardrooms remain a man 's domain - for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are underrepresented in german top management the green party has received a mixed response from all sides for its aim of setting a legal quota for top management posts .
there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

" there is no crisis for the euro as a currency , " trichet said friday in a radio interview on france 's rtl radio network .
" we have problems of financial instability that are the result of budget crises in certain european countries . "
essential for investor confidence trichet added that the central bank has the " same message " for all countries - namely , to " take all measures to make next year 's fiscal objectives credible . "
he said such action is essential for investor confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 03.12.2010 dating berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the people i know in berlin are no berliners .
and that 's not because i dislike the locals , but because it 's rather difficult to find them .
my city is the city of everyone . it was one of those perfect early weekend mornings , when you get out of the club and can smell the fresh air again .
i opted to walk home , even though it took an eternity , instead of calling a cab or waiting for the subway .
that was the moment when i started dating my city . berlin is mean .
every encounter is a new experience and , once trapped , you never want to leave again .
i did n't find a crumbling colosseum on my way that morning , neither did i see an eiffel tower , or anything else that impresses at first glance .
instead , the smell of the cafes still open at 5 am , tired ravers ordering the famous after-party berliner currywurst at a corner stand , bizarre pieces of art in gallery windows , remains of the berlin wall turned into a canvas for graffiti - block after block , it slowly got under my skin .
it was a feeling that outdid any paris or rome . it happens to all the people i know : they move here and inevitably fall in love with the city . it 's the imperfection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't find anything like this in berlin after visiting berlin , a friend of mine decided to sell his flat in the us and move here .
he had no plans , no apartment , and no job .
but he had berlin and that was enough .
a swedish friend of mine got a great job in london after spending a few years in berlin .
she earns much more than she did here , but is still desperately looking for any reason to come back to live in her old neighborhood again . another woman i know moved here from west germany , right after the fall of the berlin wall .
" it 's the imperfection of this city that i love - the chaos that makes it so special , " she told me .
and to quote some famous berlin fans , the guys from depeche mode , one could describe this madness as " no strings attached , just free love . " berlin makes you become someone else every day , just to adapt to its myriad facets .
a journey from nonconformist prenzlauer berg , where you have to stand out to fit in , along the extravagant-trashy mitte district , and ending in fancy charlottenburg is like a trip around the world - a very inexpensive one . one minute , berlin is so german and the next minute it 's everything else : russian , french , american , british , turkish , polish .
and sooner or later it turns german again . the best part is , here you can be anything , without being judged for it .
i once heard someone on the local radio saying that berlin is the place where you do n't know if something is a piece of art or a piece of garbage . flexibility required and you have to be an artist , indeed , to appreciate thousands of paradoxes that make up this city .
here , you can spend an evening at the opera and later go to a sassy fashion show , organized in a church .
you can have a drink in one of the bars housed in the rundown tacheles building -lrb- now one of the hottest spots in berlin -rrb- and then have dinner at a restaurant just a few meters away , where the brand of your scarf will suspiciously be eyed for authenticity . leave on holiday for two weeks and your beloved bakery will turn into a shoe shop , your apartment building will start getting refurbished and the metro you usually take to work wo n't be running for the next five months , due to construction work . i had an italian colleague at the university in berlin who could n't speak a word of german -lrb- we studied in english -rrb- .
well , just one word , actually : he could perfectly pronounce the tongue-twister schienenersatzverkehr .
it means that some alternative means of transport are substituting the metro you had been counting on because the rails are currently under construction .
it also means your morning commute will be a nightmare .
i guarantee it will be one of the first words you learn when you move to berlin . bildunterschrift : berlin kept the street lights that were used in communist east germany love affair with the past berlin is someone else 's past meeting your future .
and the best place to witness that is at the flea markets .
everything related to the socialist regime is more than trendy here : plastic kitchen utensils , empty boxes of washing powder , even worn-out 30-year-old shoes .
in berlin , gdr sells . nevertheless , berlin is not entirely monogamous in its love affair with the past : there 's a market for new ideas , too .
in berlin you can even make money selling paper eyeglasses made of recycled cardboard - which have no lenses and , basically , no practical use whatsoever .
a few months ago , a young berliner started wearing them at parties , just for fun , and soon they created near hysteria in the city 's hottest clubs .
now , his so-called " pappbrille " are a viable business . sometimes , this city is such a jumbled concoction that it can overwhelm .
a local photographer once said , " i have to take berlin in small doses , so i can digest it " . but i 'm still grabbing any opportunity to date my city .
i 'm ready for its imperfection and its nasty moods ; i 'm even ready for schienenersatzverkehr and construction sites , as long as i have this beautifully arranged chaos , where garbage is art and vice versa . it 's been a few years now and i 'm far from getting bored . author : lavinia pitu editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 03.12.2010 integrating students with disabilities in german schools still a battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's mother fought for him to attend an integrated school for german children with disabilities it 's always been difficult to get regular schools to allow them to attend .
now , however , things must change because of a un convention requiring schools to accept all children . when marcel was old enough to start school , his mother picked out one of the public elementary schools in their neighborhood for him .
the school , however , said he could n't attend .
why ?
they said they were n't set up to deal with a kid in a wheelchair .
for decades that 's the way it was in germany .
children with disabilities were sent to separate schools , each one specialized for a different disability .
that is all set to change now that germany has ratified a united nations resolution that says that all children with disabilities have a right to be educated at a regular school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's teacher says he 's totally integrated in his class it 's set to be a long process .
currently the majority of german children with disabilities do n't go to regular schools .
so far the city-state of bremen is the only german state to open all its schools to everyone .
in north rhine-westphalia , where marcel lives , that could be a long way off , although he did eventually find a spot in what is called an integrated or inclusive school .
" we had a hard struggle with the administration , " his mother told deutsche welle , " because i did n't want him to go to those special schools for the handicapped .
i wanted him to go to a normal school with all his friends from the neighborhood and i did n't want him to be separated from real life . "
marcel 's mother said she 's convinced that if she had n't put up such a fight and even threatened to take the school district to court he would never have been given a spot in one of the few schools in the area that teaches the disabled and the non-disabled together .
still not an option at many schools the elementary school that refused to accept marcel years ago still does n't take kids with disabilities , saying on its website that " because this is not an integration school , we can not support children with disabilities and therefore we can not accept them . "
the school is an old , brick building in a bonn neighborhood peppered with half-timber cottages with green shutters .
inside the school , a wide staircase winds its way up four flights of stairs .
at the very top the school principal , jutta fremerey , has her office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old buildings are just one hurdle to integration in germany " we ca n't take kids in wheelchairs , just because of the building , " said fremerey .
" and there are lots of buildings in germany where it would n't be possible .
at least not yet . "
fremerey was not the principal when marcel tried to attend .
she said she supports the idea of having children with disabilities in the same classroom as children without disabilities in theory , but that a lot needs to change before that would be feasible nationwide .
she would need at least two teachers per class , she said , and one of them would have to be specially trained for teaching disabled children .
she said she 'd need small extra rooms where kids could get more personal attention and all of the lessons would have to be adapted for each of the children with disabilities .
" because there are lots and lots of totally different types of disabilities and everyone needs something different , " fremerey said .
" the blind child needs something completely different from the child who ca n't hear .
the mentally disabled child needs completely different conditions than a child with emotional or social problems .
those different requirements need to be addressed . "
according to anne waldschmidt , a professor of disability studies at the university of cologne , that kind of differentiation should be expected of a teacher .
" integration or inclusion means more personalized ways of teaching … to differentiate the subjects and the topics and to give every child the chance to learn according to personality and to individual interests and at their own pace , " she said .
" so that means the whole atmosphere is more individualized and that there is n't a standard approach . "
three adults in the classroom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in marcel 's class there are three adults to help students marcel 's school , which is also in bonn , has the manpower to do just that .
in addition to the various subject-matter teachers that teach his class math , german , english or history , a special education teacher is also present all day long .
bringing the number of adults in the classroom to three is marcel 's attendant , who only occasionally has to get marcel a book he needs but can spend the rest of the time helping other kids in the class one-on-one .
marcel is totally integrated into his class , his special education teacher daniel mays said , as are the five students with learning disabilities .
" being with the other kids , it gives you the feeling of just being normal , " marcel said .
his classmate may said she does n't forget that marcel is in a wheelchair , but that it does n't make much of a difference in their friendship .
" i think it 's like with anybody else , " she said .
" when i 'm with other guys i act the same way . "
despite these successes only two of six classes in each grade at the school are integrated and it is not required to take on more disabled children .
slow progress germany may officially be on board with bringing differently abled children together , but it still has a relatively low rate of integration .
according to the european agency for development in special needs education , only about 15 percent of children with disabilities are educated in a regular classroom in germany .
in neighboring france and poland , for example , it 's about 31 percent and 46 percent , respectively .
according to mays , who has done his own statistical analysis for the state of north rhine-westphalia , any recent increase to germany 's level of integration is undone by the fact that more and more children who already attend regular schools are being identified as having a disability , usually a learning or emotional disability .
at the same time germans are having fewer children than in the past and the number of pupils drops each year .
" now we have the un convention for the rights of people with disabilities and germany ratified it a year ago .
we have to change our system into an inclusive system , " marcel 's mother said .
" but no one is willing , really willing to do it .
there are several examples like this school here .
they 've been doing it for many years .
but it 's just two classes per grade level that do integration .
why is n't it all of them ? "

we have to change our system into an inclusive system , " marcel 's mother said .
" but no one is willing , really willing to do it .
there are several examples like this school here .
they 've been doing it for many years .
but it 's just two classes per grade level that do integration .
why is n't it all of them ? "

the lawyer heading up the investigation , marion westpfahl , said at a press conference on friday that the available records pointed to huge gaps in the documentation between 1945 and 2009 .
she added this hinted strongly at a " systematic system of cover-up , " in which few abuse cases were criminally prosecuted .
" only 26 priests were convicted for sexual offences , " westpfahl explained to reporters , saying she found 365 files containing evidence that " acts of abuse had taken place in an almost commonplace manner . "
" we have to assume that there is a large unknown number -lsb- of abuse cases -rsb- , " she said .
" we are dealing with the extensive destruction of files . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich and freising archdiocese was run by the current pope in his younger days the incriminating evidence westpfahl found among 13,200 available files implicated 159 priests , 15 deacons , 96 religion teachers and six pastoral employees , with rural areas particularly affected .
the victims ' suffering often remained a mystery , she said , as the reports usually discussed abuse in coy euphemisms .
details sketchy on papal era westpfahl also said that the period of 1977 to 1982 , when pope benedikt xvi - then archbishop josef ratzinger - headed up the archdiocese , was particularly poorly documented .
in this timeframe , she only found one document , regarding an abuse case .
ratzinger had dealt with the case himself , ordering that an abusive priest be removed from his parish , she said .
westpfahl praised the church for giving her free reign in her research , a task to which she was assigned by current archbishop reinhard marx .
" for me , these were surely the worst months of my life , " marx told reporters on friday .
" i felt shame , grief and dismay .
as a church , we ask forgiveness for those things done by our church employees . "
the archdiocese of munich and freising was one of the worst hit in germany during the wave of abuse accusations that swept across much of europe in 2009 , and westpfahl 's report was commissioned in response to the allegations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

but many russians fear that the financial burden may be too high . in the streets of moscow and elsewhere in russia there were no signs of euphoria following fifa 's decision to grant the 2018 world cup to russia .
the public reaction appeared to be rather subdued compared to the outpouring of joy three years ago , when russia secured the 2014 winter olympics .
even though soccer is one of russia 's most popular sports , many russians say they never really cared whether the championship would take place in russia or elsewhere .
part of this wariness may be explained by worries over the actual cost of the event for russian taxpayers .
as experience with the preparations of the winter games in sochi has shown , the ultimate expenses may well be far higher than originally planned . more than three years before the curtain-raiser , it is already clear the games in sochi will be the most expensive ever .
the same was true for the eurovision song contest held last year in moscow .
and many observers are already convinced that the 2018 world cup will be the most costly in history .
with the short-lived euphoria over fifa 's decision over , reality has sunk in quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir putin -lrb- r . -rrb- says people are exaggerating the potential costs prime minister vladimir putin denied the costs would be too high during his press conference in zurich late on thursday , hours after fifa had announced its decision .
" according to preliminary calculations , the construction of stadiums and adjacent infrastructure will cost us around $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.6 million euros -rrb- , comparable to what was spent on the championship in south africa , " he said .
besides , he argued , part of the work was already underway and would be financed by large companies like russia 's gas monopoly gazprom , the oil company lukoil , and others .
also , he joked , russian billionaire and chelsea owner roman abramovich " has a lot of money " and will certainly want to help out financially .
all that , said putin , means that the ultimate cost might even be lower than current estimates .
on the heels of that statement , finance minister aleksei kudrin was quick to announce that the cost of the soccer championship would likely be lower than that of the winter olympics in sochi , without mentioning figures .
but critics in russia question the official calculations and point out that total investments must be well higher , given that russia not only needs to build 13 brand new stadiums in the coming seven years , but also create a huge infrastructure that does not exist today .
dozens of large and hundreds of small hotels must be erected in moscow and elsewhere to house the hundreds of thousands of football fans during the tournament .
for the hotels alone an estimated $ 11 billion will be required .
almost 10,000 kilometers -lrb- 6,200 miles -rrb- of new roads will have to be built , costing over $ 35 billion .
many railway stations and airports need to be completely renovated .
all this represents a truly daunting task for any country , but it 's a unique challenge in today 's russia , where all this work must be carried out alongside the ongoing preparations for the winter games in sochi .
one-off costs , long-term gains ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia must now prepare for two major global sports competitions the russian government emphasizes that many of the impending infrastructural projects " would have been carried out anyway , " only at a later stage .
the world cup will simply speed things up , they argue , presenting the extra costs connected with the football tournament as a long-term investment in the development of the country as a whole .
" russia is rising , " said putin in zurich .
" and in 2018 it will be even stronger . "
corruption may be another problem .
traditionally in russia large building projects , be it roads or football stadiums , are often much more expensive from the onset than similar projects in other countries .
this is usually because large amounts of money are siphoned off by state officials involved in the project .
the kremlin is well aware of the problem , judging by the apt exclamation on twitter of presidential aide arkady dvorkovich : " let 's do it without kickbacks . "
this was more likely a serious appeal than a humorous " tweet " in a country where corruption is rampant and still on the rise , according to the anti-corruption watchdog transparency international .

aid groups are opposed to the idea .
is there room for compromise ? military and civilian organizations , on the ground together in crisis regions around the world , should learn to work together more closely , said german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting earlier this week in berlin .
guttenberg told a parliamentary party congress of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , that both nonprofit aid organizations and the military needed to create a " culture of mutual trust " and cooperation , and show a more unified face to the outside world .
a question of integrity yet this type of cooperation is highly controversial .
while proponents say it puts a more unified and decisive face on german activities abroad , those opposed - such as many humanitarian aid groups who are present on the ground - say it could easily compromise their integrity and independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers have close contact to the afghan population the berlin panel , including guttenberg , discussed in depth the complex topic based on the recommendations of a cdu / csu position paper , " civil-military cooperation - an alliance for the future ? "
guttenberg acknowledged that there were prejudices on both sides of the issue .
yet he said the question was not whether , but how , the military and civic groups should work together .
umbrella group is strictly opposed according to guttenberg , the main ingredient missing for better cooperation is nerve .
his party needs to be more forceful in getting its message across , he said .
" sometimes we are afraid of our own shadow , because we think there could be unpleasant realities tied to our actions , " guttenberg said .
suzana lipovac , head of international programs at the german aid organization kinderberg international , said there were pros and cons to such cooperation .
on the one hand , years of experience had taught her the importance of being pragmatic about the use of resources .
on the other hand , she questioned the wisdom of working closely together with the military in places where that might be seen as detrimental - for example , in afghanistan .
meeting with the taliban there , her organization takes part in large public meetings that may also be attended by enemies of allied troops .
her project could not exist without these meetings , where afghan village elders , imams - and also , sometimes , taliban - meet , lipovac said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr was part of eufor troops in bosnia and herzegovina but since the aim of her humanitarian work was to help reach the millennium development goals - namely , to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates - the most important thing was getting help , wherever it could be found , she said .
however , lipovac said she has benefited from the help of german soldiers in bosnia , where the german army , or bundeswehr , was not seen as an occupying force .
lipovac said a study showed refugees in bosnian camps ranked physical security ahead of food , medical aid , or even a bottle of water .
the military can provide what aid groups can not yet safety was something that aid groups in crisis regions could n't provide , she noted .
soldiers were often needed to create a situation where humanitarian aid could be applied .
" and then we could provide that aid , " lipovac said .
but venro , an umbrella group for german development ngos , rejects out of hand the idea of working together with troops - be they german or from other countries .
robert lindner , venro 's afghanistan spokesman , warned against such cooperation , whether it be in regions with heavy or light fighting , or even where there are few projects , such as day kundi , afghanistan .
putting aid workers in danger military rebuilding specialists - so called provincial reconstruction teams , or prts - do not belong there at all , lindner said .
bringing them there would only endanger the lives of civilian aid workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is working on plans to restructure the german military " in day kundi , there are local authorities who have said ' please no projects by prts .
we know that it 's harmful to us ' and i think we should listen to the wishes of the local people in afghanistan . "
brigadier general frank leidenberger , who has had many years of experience in afghanistan , admitted that the bundeswehr had done things wrong in the past and said the connection between humanitarian and military work had yet to be made clear .
yet he acknowledged that no one has really been put in charge of connecting the two parties .
" we have definitely made mistakes , " leidenberger told the berlin panel .
" we have done operations because the civil-humanitarian situation , and the connection to development agencies , was n't clear enough .
i have to assume that , i ca n't say so exactly , because there was no one to talk to me about it . "
collateral security concept with the concept of so-called collateral security , the north atlantic treaty organization has learned what it believes are necessary lessons for further afghanistan engagement .
a broad array of instruments are necessary for conflict and crisis management , defense minister guttenberg said : diplomatic , political , economic , developmental , policing - and sometimes even military .
a change in strategy from purely putting down uprisings to offering more protection for populations was " very , very late in coming , " the minister said .
precious time had been lost , yet germany had " at least come a little bit farther " in its role as a security ally , he said .
as to guttenberg 's concept of civilian-military cooperation , brigadier general leidenberger said there was " no alternative . "

the first half of their match on friday against fellow promoted side kaiserslautern was marked by a lack of highlights from the evenly matched teams .
both teams struggled on the slippery , snowy pitch in hamburg , however when they had chances , they failed to capitalize .
shortly after the break , st. pauli got on the board when kaiserslautern 's christian tiffert inadvertently headed the ball into his own team 's goal .
the score provided the impetus for both clubs to open up the game more , but st. pauli held off the visitors to grab three important points .
both teams now have 17 points , but still remain near the bottom of the table .

" there is no crisis for the euro as a currency , " trichet said friday in a radio interview on france 's rtl radio network .
" we have problems of financial instability that are the result of budget crises in certain european countries . "
essential for investor confidence trichet added that the central bank has the " same message " for all countries - namely , to " take all measures to make next year 's fiscal objectives credible . "
he said such action is essential for investor confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

"
the drug is available in 12 eu member states , and is often sold on the internet .
however , it has been linked to a number of deaths . the european union banned the ecstasy-like party-drug mephedrone , also known as " meow meow " on friday .
the action follows in the footsteps of 15 individual european countries which had moved to ban the substance of their own accord .
" it is good to see that eu governments are prepared to take swift action to ban this dangerous drug , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said .
" -lsb- mephedrone -rsb- is sold over the internet , often behind innocent names like plant food or bath salts .
young people should not be fooled .
these drugs are harmful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding said the drug was harmful the ban includes the manufacturing and marketing of mephedrone across the european union .
the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland alone .
britain banned the substance earlier this year .
deceptively harmful mephedrone hydrochloride salt , as the drug is scientifically known , is commercially available from chemical suppliers on the internet , or from street dealers .
generally , it sells for around 10 euros to 15 euros -lrb- $ 14 to $ 20 -rrb- per gram .
it can be obtained in powder , capsule or tablet form .
owing to the fact that it is still legal in a number of countries , many users mistakenly believe it is harmless .
however , a scientific risk assessment carried out by the lisbon-based european monitoring center on drugs and drug addition -lrb- emcdda -rrb- showed that mephedrone can cause acute health problems and lead to dependency .
in at least two cases in the eu it is believed to have been the sole cause of death of people who took it .
users reportedly experience " euphoria , general stimulation , enhanced music appreciation , elevated mood , decreased hostility , improved mental function and mild sexual stimulation . "
the center reported that it is predominantly used by young people , aged 15 to 24 , and that rates of drug use are higher in males than in females .
it is often taken in night clubs or dance events .
mephodrone , also known as " bubble or " neodave " has no medical value .
the ban will not affect legislation in germany , where mephedrone has been illegal for years .
it is also already banned in austria , belgium , britain , denmark , estonia , france , ireland , italy , latvia , luxembourg , malta , poland , romania and sweden .
countries such as spain , portugal , greece and the netherlands will now have to comply with the ruling and bring their laws in line with the rest of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

as usual , reader opinions fall on either side of the argument . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
who is the man behind the wikileaks ?
i was an american sailor and i am an american citizen .
i support the man behind the wikileaks for bringing this information out .
they are right for putting the truth out for the world to know .
hopefully this kind of open government can catch on and it will mean more peace through communication and understanding . - bruce , us we will never know who is really behind julian assange .
we live in the times of such disinformation that this is an enigmatic affair of our global village . - agatha , canada he should be as afraid of the us as when somebody blows the whistle on a drug baron or a mafia boss . - alberto , great britain my opinion is that wikileaks is making a very constructive effort in promoting government by and for the people . - peter , us this is obviously a sick man with a need to feel special and garner attention .
he is probably paid off by russia or china to make the us look bad , because we finally have an intelligent president , and these countries ca n't stand it .
bush did n't need wikileaks ... he screwed up on his own .
assange is easy to diffuse - just create 10 carbon copy wikileaks sites with fake data .
nobody will know who to believe , and -lsb- assange -rsb- will not have as much interest in causing trouble anymore , because he will not feel special . - dan , us julian assange is a hero and putting his life at risk for mankind and the survival of the species by way of information and awareness correction like a correction in the stock markets .
unfortunately he has awakened a giant bear , and it 's coming after him , and his life will never be the same .
he is a real warrior , not a faceless creature hiding behind created authority . - lien , germany in my opinion , julian assange should not be the target of any legal action .
what is amazing is that interpol has many real threats to humanity such as dictators like fidel , raul castro and others .
please support a person who combats wrongdoing whatever the government affected . - liborio , cuba us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts should the us prosecute julian assange ?
no , assange was only trying to show how much hypocrisy is in the world of diplomacy and military blunder .
he should be praised for his courage . - g. , canada a lot of americans have worked hard to repair relations with germany after the iraq war .
i have reviewed the laws with several lawyers and it seems near impossible to prosecute julian assange at this time .
he really set our collective efforts back several years .
it 's very disparaging to read the german newspapers lately , and my heart sinks how far these leaks have set our relations back .
it 's a sad day here in america to see my friends in germany so upset . - stephen , us why ?
he did n't spy and he did n't steal .
the information was passed on to wikileaks by an american citizen , and assange accepted it .
the us was caught with its pants down , and now it 'll try every dirty trick in the book to find fault somewhere else ... except with itself . - vera , germany compiled by stuart tiffen editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de who is the man behind the wikileaks ?
the website wikileaks has hit the headlines again for revealing diplomatic cables from us embassies around the world , and interpol has issued an arrest warrant for its founder .
but who is the man behind wikileaks ? -lrb- 01.12.2010 -rrb- us could prosecute assange for espionage , say legal experts the pressure on wikileaks founder julian assange is mounting .
not only has he been put on interpol 's wanted list for alleged sex crimes in sweden , but the us is mulling how to take legal action against him as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 03.12.2010 lufthansa offers broadband internet again on transatlantic flights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa 's transatlantic passengers can send emails to those on the ground lufthansa 's transatlantic passengers with laptops and smartphones can now surf the internet in midair .
voice chats are n't permitted , but there 's no telling what sites passengers might visit . passengers on board transatlantic lufthansa flights , flying high in the sky , can now stay connected to the rest of the world via wireless broadband internet connections .
the airline began offering its flynet service on dec .
1 , with connections fast enough to watch videos and play online games .
although internet telephony services such as skype are not blocked , their use wo n't be permitted .
in the spring of 2011 , the company will also make mobile phone technology available for text messaging and wireless data transfer via smart phones .
lufthansa had offered the same service through connexion by boeing in 2003 but stopped in 2006 when boeing discontinued the service .
at the time , the service was used by some 30,000 passengers per month .
lufthansa press speaker boris ogursky said boeing apparently did not see the service as economically viable at the time .
" we found that to be very unfortunate , " he told deutsche welle .
" but at the time , it was clear to us – and it was clear fairly quickly – that we wanted to find a way to offer a similar service .
from our perspective , the experience was positive . "
more internet-capable devices than ever ogursky said lufthansa decided to offer the flynet service because of the benefit to customers - and to the airline .
" the fact that we offer -lrb- broadband -rrb- internet access sets us apart ... and we hope that we will be able to increase demand this way , " he said , adding that " now significantly more customers have a device capable of connecting to a wireless lan . "
according deutsche bank research analyst eric heymann , the proliferation of smartphones makes the economics of in-flight internet more viable than it was in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panasonic 's margis and lufthansa 's mayrhuber shook on the deal in 2009 " the increasing use of smartphones and other mobile devices will speed this development up , " he told deutsche welle .
" at any rate , such devices are a very clear step in the direction of mobile internet use in general . "
available to all passengers lufthansa 's ogursky said flynet is available " not just in the premium classes ; every passenger on board a -lrb- transatlantic -rrb- long-distance flight will be able to use this service . "
the fee is 10.95 euros for one hour and 19.95 euros for 24 hours .
ogursky also said the company 's decision not to permit internet telephony was based on customer surveys that indicated many would not be in favor of the move .
by comparison , deutsche bahn , which offers internet access currently in 72 high-speed ice trains , permits mobile phone conversations on board .
analyst heymann , however , sides with lufthansa .
" in business travel , some people enjoy that they are n't available for a while , " he said .
" it 's sort of the last mobile-phone-free zone . "
flynet is offered through panasonic avionics corporation and uses the payment system of deutsche telekom .
the deutsche telekom payment system can be used with a network of 8,000 hotspots throughout germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 03.12.2010 us diplomats saw german inexperience in bruno the bear 's tale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us consul general in munich read a lot into bruno 's story ' nature is good , as long as it is controlled , channeled and subdued . '
that was the us assessment of attitudes in germany and bavaria after an undocumented immigrant , a brown bear named bruno , briefly sought a new home . in one of the lighter diplomatic cables unveiled by wikileaks , it seems the us consulate in munich took considerable interest in one of bavaria 's most ill-fated immigrants - a brown bear given the name bruno .
bruno was part of a scheme to reintroduce wild bears from slovenia into the alps .
via italy and austria , he made his way to germany and was first sighted on may 20 , 2006 .
his stay was a short but eventful one , before he died at the barrel of a gun .
" as the first wild bear seen in germany since 1835 , bruno was initially extended a warm public welcome by -lsb- then -rsb- bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf , " the rather light-hearted missive to washington , signed by the former us consul general to munich , matthew rooney , recalled .
" after all , bruno could prove a boon for bavaria 's image just as visitors from around the world arrived for the world cup . "
the state premier at the time , edmund stoiber , also quickly welcomed bruno to the country , but even this gesture of friendship carried an underlying threat .
" a bear that behaves normally lives in the woods , never leaves , and snatches perhaps one or two sheep each year , " stoiber said , trying to reassure people that bruno posed no threat .
" however , as -lsb- then -rsb- bavarian interior minister -lsb- guenther -rsb- beckstein has often emphasized , foreigners are only welcome in bavaria provided they are willing to adapt to german culture and traditions , " the diplomatic message to washington cautioned with the benefit of hindsight .
' the problem bear ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno 's appetite for livestock and bold behavior made him ' ursus non grata ' bruno proved smarter than stoiber 's average bear - or rather , more troublesome .
before long , he was spied raiding stables , killing sheep , chickens , and even a child 's pet rabbit , and the us diplomat recalled how he quickly became " ursus non grata . "
" vexed by bruno 's unchecked roaming across bavaria - he was even seen sitting on the steps of a police station eating a guinea pig - -lsb- state premier -rsb- edmund stoiber took to referring to him as ' the problem bear . " '
after weeks of being germany 's new poster boy , suddenly bruno was wanted , dead or alive .
but the government 's shoot-to-kill order met considerable resistance from the public ; letters poured in to the environment minister from children around the country calling for him to spare bruno .
seeking to avoid a public outcry , the bavarian government spent at least 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 165,000 -rrb- to fly in a special bear trap from the us and trained hunters with dogs from finland .
yet these efforts did not bear fruit , and on june 26 hunting season was declared open once again .
bruno was shot dead before lunchtime .
consul general rooney notes that spiegel online likened bruno 's death with that of elvis , marilyn monroe , jimi hendrix , john lennon , and princess diana .
the online portal of der spiegel magazine , which cooperated with wikileaks in releasing the cables , was also the first to publish rooney 's comments on bruno in germany .
' modern germany … coexists uneasily with untamed nature ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' bruno the bear - shot dead by dastardly murderers on june 26 , 2006 , ' the memorial reads the initial backlash to bruno 's demise was fierce , with death threats leveled against then environment minister schnappauf and the hunter who shot the brown bear .
despite this , the us consul general in munich told his bosses in washington to expect any fallout to be " relatively fleeting , " also noting in a humorously understated manner that radical animal rights activists who make death threats are n't exactly considered the base of the christian , conservative csu party ruling the state .
" perhaps the greatest insight from the whole bruno affair might be that despite the veneer of ' greenness ' extolled by german society , modern germany in fact coexists rather uneasily with untamed nature , " rooney posited .
" true wilderness , even in mountainous bavaria , has n't really existed in germany for generations - nature is good , as long as it is controlled , channeled , subdued . "
bruno was the last known brown bear to enter the german alps .
the message to washington - which was coordinated with the us embassy in berlin - concluded that any endeavor to repopulate the region with wild creatures would probably be pointless .
" if the saga of bavaria 's ' problem bear ' is any indicator , the strategy of reintroducing wild bears to the alps , at least the german alps , may be doomed to failure - that is , unless the bears are willing to cooperate by not being too wild . "

and that 's not because i dislike the locals , but because it 's rather difficult to find them .
my city is the city of everyone . it was one of those perfect early weekend mornings , when you get out of the club and can smell the fresh air again .
i opted to walk home , even though it took an eternity , instead of calling a cab or waiting for the subway .
that was the moment when i started dating my city . berlin is mean .
every encounter is a new experience and , once trapped , you never want to leave again .
i did n't find a crumbling colosseum on my way that morning , neither did i see an eiffel tower , or anything else that impresses at first glance .
instead , the smell of the cafes still open at 5 am , tired ravers ordering the famous after-party berliner currywurst at a corner stand , bizarre pieces of art in gallery windows , remains of the berlin wall turned into a canvas for graffiti - block after block , it slowly got under my skin .
it was a feeling that outdid any paris or rome . it happens to all the people i know : they move here and inevitably fall in love with the city . it 's the imperfection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't find anything like this in berlin after visiting berlin , a friend of mine decided to sell his flat in the us and move here .
he had no plans , no apartment , and no job .
but he had berlin and that was enough .
a swedish friend of mine got a great job in london after spending a few years in berlin .
she earns much more than she did here , but is still desperately looking for any reason to come back to live in her old neighborhood again . another woman i know moved here from west germany , right after the fall of the berlin wall .
" it 's the imperfection of this city that i love - the chaos that makes it so special , " she told me .
and to quote some famous berlin fans , the guys from depeche mode , one could describe this madness as " no strings attached , just free love . " berlin makes you become someone else every day , just to adapt to its myriad facets .
a journey from nonconformist prenzlauer berg , where you have to stand out to fit in , along the extravagant-trashy mitte district , and ending in fancy charlottenburg is like a trip around the world - a very inexpensive one . one minute , berlin is so german and the next minute it 's everything else : russian , french , american , british , turkish , polish .
and sooner or later it turns german again . the best part is , here you can be anything , without being judged for it .
i once heard someone on the local radio saying that berlin is the place where you do n't know if something is a piece of art or a piece of garbage . flexibility required and you have to be an artist , indeed , to appreciate thousands of paradoxes that make up this city .
here , you can spend an evening at the opera and later go to a sassy fashion show , organized in a church .
you can have a drink in one of the bars housed in the rundown tacheles building -lrb- now one of the hottest spots in berlin -rrb- and then have dinner at a restaurant just a few meters away , where the brand of your scarf will suspiciously be eyed for authenticity . leave on holiday for two weeks and your beloved bakery will turn into a shoe shop , your apartment building will start getting refurbished and the metro you usually take to work wo n't be running for the next five months , due to construction work . i had an italian colleague at the university in berlin who could n't speak a word of german -lrb- we studied in english -rrb- .
well , just one word , actually : he could perfectly pronounce the tongue-twister schienenersatzverkehr .
it means that some alternative means of transport are substituting the metro you had been counting on because the rails are currently under construction .
it also means your morning commute will be a nightmare .
i guarantee it will be one of the first words you learn when you move to berlin . bildunterschrift : berlin kept the street lights that were used in communist east germany love affair with the past berlin is someone else 's past meeting your future .
and the best place to witness that is at the flea markets .
everything related to the socialist regime is more than trendy here : plastic kitchen utensils , empty boxes of washing powder , even worn-out 30-year-old shoes .
in berlin , gdr sells . nevertheless , berlin is not entirely monogamous in its love affair with the past : there 's a market for new ideas , too .
in berlin you can even make money selling paper eyeglasses made of recycled cardboard - which have no lenses and , basically , no practical use whatsoever .
a few months ago , a young berliner started wearing them at parties , just for fun , and soon they created near hysteria in the city 's hottest clubs .
now , his so-called " pappbrille " are a viable business . sometimes , this city is such a jumbled concoction that it can overwhelm .
a local photographer once said , " i have to take berlin in small doses , so i can digest it " . but i 'm still grabbing any opportunity to date my city .
i 'm ready for its imperfection and its nasty moods ; i 'm even ready for schienenersatzverkehr and construction sites , as long as i have this beautifully arranged chaos , where garbage is art and vice versa . it 's been a few years now and i 'm far from getting bored . author : lavinia pitu editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.12.2010 wikileaks finds online refuge in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , wikileaks re-opened at wikileaks.ch as the organization faces swift pressure from american government authorities , europe welcomes it .
three american companies have denied service to wikileaks after pressure from a us senator . early friday morning in europe , wikileaks ' domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- provider based in the united states , everydns.net , pulled the virtual plug on the controversial site wikileaks.org , meaning that it is no longer reachable at that web address .
several hours later , wikileaks announced on twitter that it was setting up shop in switzerland at wikileaks.ch , a domain name that is currently held by the president of the pirate party of switzerland .
dns is a key part of the web , which translates internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses - strings of numbers - into an actual domain name , like wikileaks.org.
" everydns.net provided domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- services to the wikileaks.org domain name until 10 pm est , december 2 , 2010 , when such services were terminated , " everydns wrote in a statement on its website .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wikileaks.ch domain name is owned by the president of the pirate party of switzerland " as with other users of the everydns.net network , this service was provided for free .
the termination of services was effected pursuant to , and in accordance with , the everydns.net acceptable use policy . "
us government pressure on the technological side of wikileaks has meant that the organization has been driven further into the arms of european online service providers and web hosts .
wikileaks also is accepting international online donations via datacell.com , a web hosting company based in iceland and switzerland , and the site provides bank details for a german and an icelandic bank to send donations .
on wednesday , following the ouster from amazon , wikileaks sent out this message on twitter : " wikileaks servers at amazon ousted .
free speech the land of the free - fine our $ are now spent to employ people in europe . "
american online support of wikileaks under government pressure everydns.net is now the third such us-based company that has pulled the virtual rug out from wikileaks in recent days after increased pressure from the us government , especially senator joe lieberman , a conservative independent from the northeastern state of connecticut .
earlier in the week , the seattle-based data visualization company tableau , which had previously provided graphs and other services to wikileaks , removed its data after a public request from lieberman .
most notably , on wednesday , amazon.com also removed wikileaks ' data from its online hosting services under pressure from lieberman , saying that wikileaks ' presence violated its terms of service .
on thursday , lieberman and two other us senators introduced a new bill , calling it the securing human intelligence and enforcing lawful dissemination -lrb- shield -rrb- act .
the bill would amend the american espionage act , which already forbids publishing classified information on wiretapping or american cryptography secrets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sen. joe lieberman has been the main force behind getting us firms to distance themselves from wikileaks the new law would extend this ban to human intelligence as well , " concerning the human intelligence activities of the united states or any foreign government . "
however , if the bill passes , it would not apply to all documents that wikileaks has released up until its passage as the american constitution explicitly forbids ex post facto laws .
further , on wednesday , december 8 , osama bedier , the vice president of the american online payment firm paypal , admitted at a paris tech conference that his company had blocked wikileaks ' paypal account based on a letter from a united states department of state legal advisor to wikileaks .
this letter , which was published by reuters on november 28 , states that wikileaks ' publication of the american diplomatic cables were " in violation of u.s. law . "
swedish company provides anonymous hosting as of friday , wikileaks ' website was being physically hosted in sweden at prq , in stockholm .
on thursday , wikileaks had been using ovh , a french host , and bahnhof , another host in sweden .
" you know how they work , they move around a lot , " said mikael viborg , the ceo of prq , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they do n't want to get caught in one place . "
viborg added that his company prides itself on providing hosting with " 100 percent anonymity . "
" it means that i do n't want to know who you are and you might want to know who i am , but when the authorities comes to us , we have no way of knowing , " he said , adding that wikileaks told his company who it was and that the organization , through an intermediary in sweden , recently paid $ 11,000 for three months of hosting service .
a second french host , octopuce , based in paris , was also a wikileaks host for about six weeks up until this week , when the wikileaks site sustained a decent-sized cyberattack of 10 gigabits per second .
" we are no longer hosting as of wednesday since they had a great number increasing distributed denial of service attacks , and the latest one was too much for our infrastructure and we were forced to ask them to find another safe haven for their machines , " said benjamin sontag , the head of octopuce , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he said wikileaks came to octopuce , adding that his company currently hosts a number of high-profile french sites , including the highly respected journal le monde diplomatique .
" one of our current customers knew them and they asked us to give -lsb- wikileaks -rsb- some hosting and some infrastructure advice , " he said , declining to elaborate on how much wikileaks paid , nor what specific services they paid for .
wikileaks continues to evade however , wikileaks seems to be in a position where it knows that its speech is protected under the us constitution .
so , for now , it may be nearly impossible to stop what wikileaks is doing , according to one american tech law expert .
" a company like amazon has a right to decide who it wants to do business with - amazon is within its rights to decide that it 's not going to work with certain customers , " said marcia hoffman , a senior staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation in san francisco , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the distributed nature of the internet means that wikileaks can be accessed and hosted from anywhere " if the us government were to have issued some sort of official legal threat or attempted to go to the courts to get the courts to issue an order to shut down wikileaks , that would pretty clearly be a prior restraint of speech .
and that would n't be constitutionally allowed .
it 's unfortunate to see this situation where you have a united states senator putting pressure on a private company to revoke services because this is something that the government could n't do itself . "
further , because us jurisdiction does not extend to european web hosts , wikileaks can continue to evade american legal action for now .
" if the us wants to do whatever it can to stop wikileaks ' speech , the fact that these servers are hosted in other countries makes it even harder , because the united states does n't have any leverage there , " she added .
" they can certainly ask other countries to be cooperative to try to do something , but the fact that the speech is hosted in other countries makes it harder for them to actually do anything about it . "
but hoffman also pointed out that the internet itself may be the us government 's problem .
" this is one reason why it 's pretty fruitless to try to stop wikileaks by any sort of legal tactic .
because as a purely technical matter , the horse is out of the barn here , " she concluded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the precise whereabouts of julian assange , wikileaks ' leader , are unknown " the data is out there .
the data is in a form where it can be hosted in multiple places by multiple people and if somehow some government managed to stop wikileaks tomorrow , that does n't stop the speech at all .
and that 's just the reality of the internet . "
however , not all tech policy observers agree that wikileaks can hide forever in europe 's digital infrastructure .
" to a great extent , the ' legalities ' of the locations of the servers are becoming less important , " said joe mcnamee of the european digital rights initiative , a brussels-based advocacy organization , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" the us and eu and every available international organization are both working hard on reaching deals with internet providers to take extrajudicial actions against organizations accused of illegal activities - including taking action against resources abroad using control of key internet infrastructure . "
tech-savvy europeans continue support still , another one of wikileaks ' hosts , jon karlung , chairman of bahnhof in sweden , agreed with hoffman , saying that his company was treating wikileaks as any other customer .
while he declined to say exactly what wikileaks paid for , he did say that its level of hosting and bandwidth would ordinarily cost 500 to 1,000 euros per month .
" we do not shut down clients unless there are solid legal claims to do so from the appropriate authorities and in sweden that would be the swedish authorities and not american authorities , and not an american senator , " karlung said , adding that his company has had no contact with a law enforcement agency concerning wikileaks thus far .
karlung added that he has had no contact with julian assange , the elusive head of wikileaks , except for when they spoke on the phone initially to activate wikileaks ' service " a few months ago . "
in the end , even if american authorities are somehow able to shut down wikileaks on its european servers , the organization already has significant support amongst many tech-savvy people worldwide , which continues to be able to thwart the best efforts of all governments .
" i believe the public has a right to all information , in order to make the right decisions , " added mikael viborg , the chief executive of the swedish host , prq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 03.12.2010 lufthansa offers broadband internet again on transatlantic flights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa 's transatlantic passengers can send emails to those on the ground lufthansa 's transatlantic passengers with laptops and smartphones can now surf the internet in midair .
voice chats are n't permitted , but there 's no telling what sites passengers might visit . passengers on board transatlantic lufthansa flights , flying high in the sky , can now stay connected to the rest of the world via wireless broadband internet connections .
the airline began offering its flynet service on dec .
1 , with connections fast enough to watch videos and play online games .
although internet telephony services such as skype are not blocked , their use wo n't be permitted .
in the spring of 2011 , the company will also make mobile phone technology available for text messaging and wireless data transfer via smart phones .
lufthansa had offered the same service through connexion by boeing in 2003 but stopped in 2006 when boeing discontinued the service .
at the time , the service was used by some 30,000 passengers per month .
lufthansa press speaker boris ogursky said boeing apparently did not see the service as economically viable at the time .
" we found that to be very unfortunate , " he told deutsche welle .
" but at the time , it was clear to us – and it was clear fairly quickly – that we wanted to find a way to offer a similar service .
from our perspective , the experience was positive . "
more internet-capable devices than ever ogursky said lufthansa decided to offer the flynet service because of the benefit to customers - and to the airline .
" the fact that we offer -lrb- broadband -rrb- internet access sets us apart ... and we hope that we will be able to increase demand this way , " he said , adding that " now significantly more customers have a device capable of connecting to a wireless lan . "
according deutsche bank research analyst eric heymann , the proliferation of smartphones makes the economics of in-flight internet more viable than it was in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panasonic 's margis and lufthansa 's mayrhuber shook on the deal in 2009 " the increasing use of smartphones and other mobile devices will speed this development up , " he told deutsche welle .
" at any rate , such devices are a very clear step in the direction of mobile internet use in general . "
available to all passengers lufthansa 's ogursky said flynet is available " not just in the premium classes ; every passenger on board a -lrb- transatlantic -rrb- long-distance flight will be able to use this service . "
the fee is 10.95 euros for one hour and 19.95 euros for 24 hours .
ogursky also said the company 's decision not to permit internet telephony was based on customer surveys that indicated many would not be in favor of the move .
by comparison , deutsche bahn , which offers internet access currently in 72 high-speed ice trains , permits mobile phone conversations on board .
analyst heymann , however , sides with lufthansa .
" in business travel , some people enjoy that they are n't available for a while , " he said .
" it 's sort of the last mobile-phone-free zone . "
flynet is offered through panasonic avionics corporation and uses the payment system of deutsche telekom .
the deutsche telekom payment system can be used with a network of 8,000 hotspots throughout germany .

"
the drug is available in 12 eu member states , and is often sold on the internet .
however , it has been linked to a number of deaths . the european union banned the ecstasy-like party-drug mephedrone , also known as " meow meow " on friday .
the action follows in the footsteps of 15 individual european countries which had moved to ban the substance of their own accord .
" it is good to see that eu governments are prepared to take swift action to ban this dangerous drug , " eu justice commissioner viviane reding said .
" -lsb- mephedrone -rsb- is sold over the internet , often behind innocent names like plant food or bath salts .
young people should not be fooled .
these drugs are harmful . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding said the drug was harmful the ban includes the manufacturing and marketing of mephedrone across the european union .
the drug has been linked to 37 deaths in britain and ireland alone .
britain banned the substance earlier this year .
deceptively harmful mephedrone hydrochloride salt , as the drug is scientifically known , is commercially available from chemical suppliers on the internet , or from street dealers .
generally , it sells for around 10 euros to 15 euros -lrb- $ 14 to $ 20 -rrb- per gram .
it can be obtained in powder , capsule or tablet form .
owing to the fact that it is still legal in a number of countries , many users mistakenly believe it is harmless .
however , a scientific risk assessment carried out by the lisbon-based european monitoring center on drugs and drug addition -lrb- emcdda -rrb- showed that mephedrone can cause acute health problems and lead to dependency .
in at least two cases in the eu it is believed to have been the sole cause of death of people who took it .
users reportedly experience " euphoria , general stimulation , enhanced music appreciation , elevated mood , decreased hostility , improved mental function and mild sexual stimulation . "
the center reported that it is predominantly used by young people , aged 15 to 24 , and that rates of drug use are higher in males than in females .
it is often taken in night clubs or dance events .
mephodrone , also known as " bubble or " neodave " has no medical value .
the ban will not affect legislation in germany , where mephedrone has been illegal for years .
it is also already banned in austria , belgium , britain , denmark , estonia , france , ireland , italy , latvia , luxembourg , malta , poland , romania and sweden .
countries such as spain , portugal , greece and the netherlands will now have to comply with the ruling and bring their laws in line with the rest of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 03.12.2010 german boardrooms remain a man 's domain - for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are underrepresented in german top management the green party has received a mixed response from all sides for its aim of setting a legal quota for top management posts .
there 's hardly any consensus on the issue - whether in the world of politics or of business . germany 's green party wants 40 percent of positions on executive and supervisory boards to be filled by women .
but politicians and businesspeople alike are far from consensus when it comes to introducing a legal quota .
" germany is a late starter , " said green party leader renate kuenast during a parliamentary debate on the subject on friday .
" employers have n't moved into the 21st century yet .
if women are better educated than men , why do we keep employing the worse candidates ? "
women only make up 10 percent of advisory boards in germany .
in norway , where such a quota was introduced in 2006 , one-third of supervisory board members are women .
in terms of management boards , germany fares even worse - only 2 percent include women .
sweden ranks at the top of the list for women on managerial boards .
there , 17 percent of company executives are female .
the us and great britain are close behind , with 14 percent .
those in favor of a quota say it 's the only way to increase the number of women in german boardrooms .
lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuenast says germany is lagging behind " for almost 10 years , german industry has had an obligation to bring more women into management positions and to achieve a certain amount of parity , " petra ledendecker , the president of the association for german businesswomen , told deutsche welle .
" nothing has happened in these 10 years , so we think that without a quota , we ca n't achieve this . "
german society has been slow to break away from stereotypical gender roles .
until 1977 women had to have their husbands ' permission to go to work .
what needs to be changed is the culture , ledendecker said .
but companies do n't want to change , and bringing more women into top management is low on their priority list , she added .
" my experience in germany 's biggest companies is that men show the biggest resistance , and there are alliances who say no way , " she said .
fear of stigmatization but such men are not alone .
marie-christine ostermann , chairwoman of the german association of young entrepreneurs , think quotas could do more harm than good , by stigmatizing women .
" i would never want to be reduced to a quota , " she said .
" i would want to get a job because of my qualifications , not because of my sex . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ostermann would be mortified to be chosen on the basis of her sex other opponents , such as the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , say that a quota for women in management would lead to more bureaucracy and would be too restrictive .
they also argue that quotas do n't actually address the underlying reasons why few women can be found in top management .
" we think that it 's fundamental that we make having a family and a career more compatible , because only in this way can we ensure that women are able to work without long interruptions , after having a child , " said anne zimmermann , head of the dihk 's social security , healthcare and family life unit .
the dihk introduced family-friendly flexible working hours four years ago , but that has n't changed the situation on its managerial board .
only one of its 14 top management and departmental head positions is held by a woman .
zimmermann said another problem was that women chose to study the wrong subjects .
" women make very narrow career choices , " she said .
" they tend to go for service sector jobs and careers that have less to do with -lsb- science and technology -rsb- .
so they choose career paths that do n't take them into the big companies and therefore do n't lead to the top jobs on executive and supervisory boards . "
as in the outside world , the debate in parliament elicited mixed reactions on friday , with the opposition greens , social democrats and left party largely in favor of a quota system , and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats against one .

international help has begun pouring in . more than 30 square kilometers -lrb- 12 square miles -rrb- of land and at least 1.5 million trees have been scorched in forest fires in northern israel , the country 's nature and parks authority said on friday .
the fires started on thursday , close to the port of haifa and strong winds were pushing the flames closer to the city .
national fire chief shimon romach said on friday that teams were " far from bringing it under control . "
international planes and helicopters swooped over the israeli woodland , dumping seawater on the flames as israel 's fire service was overwhelmed by the blazes .
dry ground caused by drought helped the fire spread quickly , sending up huge columns of smoke throughout the area .
national police commissioner david cohen said on friday evening that some 17,000 people had been evacuated from the area .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes from all over europe have joined to fight the fires the cause of the fire remained unclear on friday .
police commissioner cohen said the fire had one ignition point and special investigators were looking into whether the fire was caused by deliberate arson or negligence .
turkey pledges support international firefighting planes and tons of equipment arrived in israel on friday as more than a dozen countries joined efforts to extinguish the fires .
there are only 1,500 firefighters operating across israel , a number widely accepted as woefully inadequate for a country of 7.6 million people .
the fire service has no firefighting planes at its disposal , which prompted an urgent appeal for international help from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
in response , offers of assistance came pouring in , and , by friday morning , five greek aircraft had landed in israel , alongside a plane and a police helicopter from cyprus , a bulgarian plane carrying 100 firefighters and a british chopper .
the foreign ministry said it had also received pledges of help from azerbaijan , croatia , egypt , france , jordan , romania , russia , spain and turkey .
despite lingering diplomatic tensions between israel and turkey , ankara said it would send two firefighting planes in a gesture personally ordered by prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
prime minister netanyahu took time out to thank erdogan for sending help - believed to be the first time the pair have spoken since netanyahu took office 18 months ago .

" there is no crisis for the euro as a currency , " trichet said friday in a radio interview on france 's rtl radio network .
" we have problems of financial instability that are the result of budget crises in certain european countries . "
essential for investor confidence trichet added that the central bank has the " same message " for all countries - namely , to " take all measures to make next year 's fiscal objectives credible . "
he said such action is essential for investor confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

the lawyer heading up the investigation , marion westpfahl , said at a press conference on friday that the available records pointed to huge gaps in the documentation between 1945 and 2009 .
she added this hinted strongly at a " systematic system of cover-up , " in which few abuse cases were criminally prosecuted .
" only 26 priests were convicted for sexual offences , " westpfahl explained to reporters , saying she found 365 files containing evidence that " acts of abuse had taken place in an almost commonplace manner . "
" we have to assume that there is a large unknown number -lsb- of abuse cases -rsb- , " she said .
" we are dealing with the extensive destruction of files . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich and freising archdiocese was run by the current pope in his younger days the incriminating evidence westpfahl found among 13,200 available files implicated 159 priests , 15 deacons , 96 religion teachers and six pastoral employees , with rural areas particularly affected .
the victims ' suffering often remained a mystery , she said , as the reports usually discussed abuse in coy euphemisms .
details sketchy on papal era westpfahl also said that the period of 1977 to 1982 , when pope benedikt xvi - then archbishop josef ratzinger - headed up the archdiocese , was particularly poorly documented .
in this timeframe , she only found one document , regarding an abuse case .
ratzinger had dealt with the case himself , ordering that an abusive priest be removed from his parish , she said .
westpfahl praised the church for giving her free reign in her research , a task to which she was assigned by current archbishop reinhard marx .
" for me , these were surely the worst months of my life , " marx told reporters on friday .
" i felt shame , grief and dismay .
as a church , we ask forgiveness for those things done by our church employees . "
the archdiocese of munich and freising was one of the worst hit in germany during the wave of abuse accusations that swept across much of europe in 2009 , and westpfahl 's report was commissioned in response to the allegations .

aid groups are opposed to the idea .
is there room for compromise ? military and civilian organizations , on the ground together in crisis regions around the world , should learn to work together more closely , said german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg at a meeting earlier this week in berlin .
guttenberg told a parliamentary party congress of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , that both nonprofit aid organizations and the military needed to create a " culture of mutual trust " and cooperation , and show a more unified face to the outside world .
a question of integrity yet this type of cooperation is highly controversial .
while proponents say it puts a more unified and decisive face on german activities abroad , those opposed - such as many humanitarian aid groups who are present on the ground - say it could easily compromise their integrity and independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers have close contact to the afghan population the berlin panel , including guttenberg , discussed in depth the complex topic based on the recommendations of a cdu / csu position paper , " civil-military cooperation - an alliance for the future ? "
guttenberg acknowledged that there were prejudices on both sides of the issue .
yet he said the question was not whether , but how , the military and civic groups should work together .
umbrella group is strictly opposed according to guttenberg , the main ingredient missing for better cooperation is nerve .
his party needs to be more forceful in getting its message across , he said .
" sometimes we are afraid of our own shadow , because we think there could be unpleasant realities tied to our actions , " guttenberg said .
suzana lipovac , head of international programs at the german aid organization kinderberg international , said there were pros and cons to such cooperation .
on the one hand , years of experience had taught her the importance of being pragmatic about the use of resources .
on the other hand , she questioned the wisdom of working closely together with the military in places where that might be seen as detrimental - for example , in afghanistan .
meeting with the taliban there , her organization takes part in large public meetings that may also be attended by enemies of allied troops .
her project could not exist without these meetings , where afghan village elders , imams - and also , sometimes , taliban - meet , lipovac said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr was part of eufor troops in bosnia and herzegovina but since the aim of her humanitarian work was to help reach the millennium development goals - namely , to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates - the most important thing was getting help , wherever it could be found , she said .
however , lipovac said she has benefited from the help of german soldiers in bosnia , where the german army , or bundeswehr , was not seen as an occupying force .
lipovac said a study showed refugees in bosnian camps ranked physical security ahead of food , medical aid , or even a bottle of water .
the military can provide what aid groups can not yet safety was something that aid groups in crisis regions could n't provide , she noted .
soldiers were often needed to create a situation where humanitarian aid could be applied .
" and then we could provide that aid , " lipovac said .
but venro , an umbrella group for german development ngos , rejects out of hand the idea of working together with troops - be they german or from other countries .
robert lindner , venro 's afghanistan spokesman , warned against such cooperation , whether it be in regions with heavy or light fighting , or even where there are few projects , such as day kundi , afghanistan .
putting aid workers in danger military rebuilding specialists - so called provincial reconstruction teams , or prts - do not belong there at all , lindner said .
bringing them there would only endanger the lives of civilian aid workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is working on plans to restructure the german military " in day kundi , there are local authorities who have said ' please no projects by prts .
we know that it 's harmful to us ' and i think we should listen to the wishes of the local people in afghanistan . "
brigadier general frank leidenberger , who has had many years of experience in afghanistan , admitted that the bundeswehr had done things wrong in the past and said the connection between humanitarian and military work had yet to be made clear .
yet he acknowledged that no one has really been put in charge of connecting the two parties .
" we have definitely made mistakes , " leidenberger told the berlin panel .
" we have done operations because the civil-humanitarian situation , and the connection to development agencies , was n't clear enough .
i have to assume that , i ca n't say so exactly , because there was no one to talk to me about it . "
collateral security concept with the concept of so-called collateral security , the north atlantic treaty organization has learned what it believes are necessary lessons for further afghanistan engagement .
a broad array of instruments are necessary for conflict and crisis management , defense minister guttenberg said : diplomatic , political , economic , developmental , policing - and sometimes even military .
a change in strategy from purely putting down uprisings to offering more protection for populations was " very , very late in coming , " the minister said .
precious time had been lost , yet germany had " at least come a little bit farther " in its role as a security ally , he said .
as to guttenberg 's concept of civilian-military cooperation , brigadier general leidenberger said there was " no alternative . "

" there is no crisis for the euro as a currency , " trichet said friday in a radio interview on france 's rtl radio network .
" we have problems of financial instability that are the result of budget crises in certain european countries . "
essential for investor confidence trichet added that the central bank has the " same message " for all countries - namely , to " take all measures to make next year 's fiscal objectives credible . "
he said such action is essential for investor confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank is n't budging on interest rates the ecb also left its key interest rate at a record low 1.0 percent .
trichet said the decision to leave the rate unchanged was necessary to continue providing " price stability . "
the rate was set in may 2009 .
asked whether the shift to fiscal consolidation could push eurozone countries into a recession , trichet replied : " i do n't think so . "
aggressive action on thursday , the ecb conceded emergency support to troubled eurozone countries was still needed .
the announcement came just months after the central bank indicated it would wind down the program .
but it stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis , which has already engulfed greece and ireland .
financial markets had hoped to see a significant increase in the bond-buying emergency program .
trichet must balance a number of opposing forces , such as economic growth .
growth in germany , for instance , has been better than expected , contrasting sharply with results in weaker countries .

the first half of their match on friday against fellow promoted side kaiserslautern was marked by a lack of highlights from the evenly matched teams .
both teams struggled on the slippery , snowy pitch in hamburg , however when they had chances , they failed to capitalize .
shortly after the break , st. pauli got on the board when kaiserslautern 's christian tiffert inadvertently headed the ball into his own team 's goal .
the score provided the impetus for both clubs to open up the game more , but st. pauli held off the visitors to grab three important points .
both teams now have 17 points , but still remain near the bottom of the table .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 03.12.2010 integrating students with disabilities in german schools still a battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's mother fought for him to attend an integrated school for german children with disabilities it 's always been difficult to get regular schools to allow them to attend .
now , however , things must change because of a un convention requiring schools to accept all children . when marcel was old enough to start school , his mother picked out one of the public elementary schools in their neighborhood for him .
the school , however , said he could n't attend .
why ?
they said they were n't set up to deal with a kid in a wheelchair .
for decades that 's the way it was in germany .
children with disabilities were sent to separate schools , each one specialized for a different disability .
that is all set to change now that germany has ratified a united nations resolution that says that all children with disabilities have a right to be educated at a regular school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's teacher says he 's totally integrated in his class it 's set to be a long process .
currently the majority of german children with disabilities do n't go to regular schools .
so far the city-state of bremen is the only german state to open all its schools to everyone .
in north rhine-westphalia , where marcel lives , that could be a long way off , although he did eventually find a spot in what is called an integrated or inclusive school .
" we had a hard struggle with the administration , " his mother told deutsche welle , " because i did n't want him to go to those special schools for the handicapped .
i wanted him to go to a normal school with all his friends from the neighborhood and i did n't want him to be separated from real life . "
marcel 's mother said she 's convinced that if she had n't put up such a fight and even threatened to take the school district to court he would never have been given a spot in one of the few schools in the area that teaches the disabled and the non-disabled together .
still not an option at many schools the elementary school that refused to accept marcel years ago still does n't take kids with disabilities , saying on its website that " because this is not an integration school , we can not support children with disabilities and therefore we can not accept them . "
the school is an old , brick building in a bonn neighborhood peppered with half-timber cottages with green shutters .
inside the school , a wide staircase winds its way up four flights of stairs .
at the very top the school principal , jutta fremerey , has her office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old buildings are just one hurdle to integration in germany " we ca n't take kids in wheelchairs , just because of the building , " said fremerey .
" and there are lots of buildings in germany where it would n't be possible .
at least not yet . "
fremerey was not the principal when marcel tried to attend .
she said she supports the idea of having children with disabilities in the same classroom as children without disabilities in theory , but that a lot needs to change before that would be feasible nationwide .
she would need at least two teachers per class , she said , and one of them would have to be specially trained for teaching disabled children .
she said she 'd need small extra rooms where kids could get more personal attention and all of the lessons would have to be adapted for each of the children with disabilities .
" because there are lots and lots of totally different types of disabilities and everyone needs something different , " fremerey said .
" the blind child needs something completely different from the child who ca n't hear .
the mentally disabled child needs completely different conditions than a child with emotional or social problems .
those different requirements need to be addressed . "
according to anne waldschmidt , a professor of disability studies at the university of cologne , that kind of differentiation should be expected of a teacher .
" integration or inclusion means more personalized ways of teaching … to differentiate the subjects and the topics and to give every child the chance to learn according to personality and to individual interests and at their own pace , " she said .
" so that means the whole atmosphere is more individualized and that there is n't a standard approach . "
three adults in the classroom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in marcel 's class there are three adults to help students marcel 's school , which is also in bonn , has the manpower to do just that .
in addition to the various subject-matter teachers that teach his class math , german , english or history , a special education teacher is also present all day long .
bringing the number of adults in the classroom to three is marcel 's attendant , who only occasionally has to get marcel a book he needs but can spend the rest of the time helping other kids in the class one-on-one .
marcel is totally integrated into his class , his special education teacher daniel mays said , as are the five students with learning disabilities .
" being with the other kids , it gives you the feeling of just being normal , " marcel said .
his classmate may said she does n't forget that marcel is in a wheelchair , but that it does n't make much of a difference in their friendship .
" i think it 's like with anybody else , " she said .
" when i 'm with other guys i act the same way . "
despite these successes only two of six classes in each grade at the school are integrated and it is not required to take on more disabled children .
slow progress germany may officially be on board with bringing differently abled children together , but it still has a relatively low rate of integration .
according to the european agency for development in special needs education , only about 15 percent of children with disabilities are educated in a regular classroom in germany .
in neighboring france and poland , for example , it 's about 31 percent and 46 percent , respectively .
according to mays , who has done his own statistical analysis for the state of north rhine-westphalia , any recent increase to germany 's level of integration is undone by the fact that more and more children who already attend regular schools are being identified as having a disability , usually a learning or emotional disability .
at the same time germans are having fewer children than in the past and the number of pupils drops each year .
" now we have the un convention for the rights of people with disabilities and germany ratified it a year ago .
we have to change our system into an inclusive system , " marcel 's mother said .
" but no one is willing , really willing to do it .
there are several examples like this school here .
they 've been doing it for many years .
but it 's just two classes per grade level that do integration .
why is n't it all of them ? "

now , however , things must change because of a un convention requiring schools to accept all children . when marcel was old enough to start school , his mother picked out one of the public elementary schools in their neighborhood for him .
the school , however , said he could n't attend .
why ?
they said they were n't set up to deal with a kid in a wheelchair .
for decades that 's the way it was in germany .
children with disabilities were sent to separate schools , each one specialized for a different disability .
that is all set to change now that germany has ratified a united nations resolution that says that all children with disabilities have a right to be educated at a regular school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's teacher says he 's totally integrated in his class it 's set to be a long process .
currently the majority of german children with disabilities do n't go to regular schools .
so far the city-state of bremen is the only german state to open all its schools to everyone .
in north rhine-westphalia , where marcel lives , that could be a long way off , although he did eventually find a spot in what is called an integrated or inclusive school .
" we had a hard struggle with the administration , " his mother told deutsche welle , " because i did n't want him to go to those special schools for the handicapped .
i wanted him to go to a normal school with all his friends from the neighborhood and i did n't want him to be separated from real life . "
marcel 's mother said she 's convinced that if she had n't put up such a fight and even threatened to take the school district to court he would never have been given a spot in one of the few schools in the area that teaches the disabled and the non-disabled together .
still not an option at many schools the elementary school that refused to accept marcel years ago still does n't take kids with disabilities , saying on its website that " because this is not an integration school , we can not support children with disabilities and therefore we can not accept them . "
the school is an old , brick building in a bonn neighborhood peppered with half-timber cottages with green shutters .
inside the school , a wide staircase winds its way up four flights of stairs .
at the very top the school principal , jutta fremerey , has her office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old buildings are just one hurdle to integration in germany " we ca n't take kids in wheelchairs , just because of the building , " said fremerey .
" and there are lots of buildings in germany where it would n't be possible .
at least not yet . "
fremerey was not the principal when marcel tried to attend .
she said she supports the idea of having children with disabilities in the same classroom as children without disabilities in theory , but that a lot needs to change before that would be feasible nationwide .
she would need at least two teachers per class , she said , and one of them would have to be specially trained for teaching disabled children .
she said she 'd need small extra rooms where kids could get more personal attention and all of the lessons would have to be adapted for each of the children with disabilities .
" because there are lots and lots of totally different types of disabilities and everyone needs something different , " fremerey said .
" the blind child needs something completely different from the child who ca n't hear .
the mentally disabled child needs completely different conditions than a child with emotional or social problems .
those different requirements need to be addressed . "
according to anne waldschmidt , a professor of disability studies at the university of cologne , that kind of differentiation should be expected of a teacher .
" integration or inclusion means more personalized ways of teaching … to differentiate the subjects and the topics and to give every child the chance to learn according to personality and to individual interests and at their own pace , " she said .
" so that means the whole atmosphere is more individualized and that there is n't a standard approach . "
three adults in the classroom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in marcel 's class there are three adults to help students marcel 's school , which is also in bonn , has the manpower to do just that .
in addition to the various subject-matter teachers that teach his class math , german , english or history , a special education teacher is also present all day long .
bringing the number of adults in the classroom to three is marcel 's attendant , who only occasionally has to get marcel a book he needs but can spend the rest of the time helping other kids in the class one-on-one .
marcel is totally integrated into his class , his special education teacher daniel mays said , as are the five students with learning disabilities .
" being with the other kids , it gives you the feeling of just being normal , " marcel said .
his classmate may said she does n't forget that marcel is in a wheelchair , but that it does n't make much of a difference in their friendship .
" i think it 's like with anybody else , " she said .
" when i 'm with other guys i act the same way . "
despite these successes only two of six classes in each grade at the school are integrated and it is not required to take on more disabled children .
slow progress germany may officially be on board with bringing differently abled children together , but it still has a relatively low rate of integration .
according to the european agency for development in special needs education , only about 15 percent of children with disabilities are educated in a regular classroom in germany .
in neighboring france and poland , for example , it 's about 31 percent and 46 percent , respectively .
according to mays , who has done his own statistical analysis for the state of north rhine-westphalia , any recent increase to germany 's level of integration is undone by the fact that more and more children who already attend regular schools are being identified as having a disability , usually a learning or emotional disability .
at the same time germans are having fewer children than in the past and the number of pupils drops each year .
" now we have the un convention for the rights of people with disabilities and germany ratified it a year ago .
we have to change our system into an inclusive system , " marcel 's mother said .
" but no one is willing , really willing to do it .
there are several examples like this school here .
they 've been doing it for many years .
but it 's just two classes per grade level that do integration .
why is n't it all of them ? "

now , however , things must change because of a un convention requiring schools to accept all children . when marcel was old enough to start school , his mother picked out one of the public elementary schools in their neighborhood for him .
the school , however , said he could n't attend .
why ?
they said they were n't set up to deal with a kid in a wheelchair .
for decades that 's the way it was in germany .
children with disabilities were sent to separate schools , each one specialized for a different disability .
that is all set to change now that germany has ratified a united nations resolution that says that all children with disabilities have a right to be educated at a regular school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's teacher says he 's totally integrated in his class it 's set to be a long process .
currently the majority of german children with disabilities do n't go to regular schools .
so far the city-state of bremen is the only german state to open all its schools to everyone .
in north rhine-westphalia , where marcel lives , that could be a long way off , although he did eventually find a spot in what is called an integrated or inclusive school .
" we had a hard struggle with the administration , " his mother told deutsche welle , " because i did n't want him to go to those special schools for the handicapped .
i wanted him to go to a normal school with all his friends from the neighborhood and i did n't want him to be separated from real life . "
marcel 's mother said she 's convinced that if she had n't put up such a fight and even threatened to take the school district to court he would never have been given a spot in one of the few schools in the area that teaches the disabled and the non-disabled together .
still not an option at many schools the elementary school that refused to accept marcel years ago still does n't take kids with disabilities , saying on its website that " because this is not an integration school , we can not support children with disabilities and therefore we can not accept them . "
the school is an old , brick building in a bonn neighborhood peppered with half-timber cottages with green shutters .
inside the school , a wide staircase winds its way up four flights of stairs .
at the very top the school principal , jutta fremerey , has her office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old buildings are just one hurdle to integration in germany " we ca n't take kids in wheelchairs , just because of the building , " said fremerey .
" and there are lots of buildings in germany where it would n't be possible .
at least not yet . "
fremerey was not the principal when marcel tried to attend .
she said she supports the idea of having children with disabilities in the same classroom as children without disabilities in theory , but that a lot needs to change before that would be feasible nationwide .
she would need at least two teachers per class , she said , and one of them would have to be specially trained for teaching disabled children .
she said she 'd need small extra rooms where kids could get more personal attention and all of the lessons would have to be adapted for each of the children with disabilities .
" because there are lots and lots of totally different types of disabilities and everyone needs something different , " fremerey said .
" the blind child needs something completely different from the child who ca n't hear .
the mentally disabled child needs completely different conditions than a child with emotional or social problems .
those different requirements need to be addressed . "
according to anne waldschmidt , a professor of disability studies at the university of cologne , that kind of differentiation should be expected of a teacher .
" integration or inclusion means more personalized ways of teaching … to differentiate the subjects and the topics and to give every child the chance to learn according to personality and to individual interests and at their own pace , " she said .
" so that means the whole atmosphere is more individualized and that there is n't a standard approach . "
three adults in the classroom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in marcel 's class there are three adults to help students marcel 's school , which is also in bonn , has the manpower to do just that .
in addition to the various subject-matter teachers that teach his class math , german , english or history , a special education teacher is also present all day long .
bringing the number of adults in the classroom to three is marcel 's attendant , who only occasionally has to get marcel a book he needs but can spend the rest of the time helping other kids in the class one-on-one .
marcel is totally integrated into his class , his special education teacher daniel mays said , as are the five students with learning disabilities .
" being with the other kids , it gives you the feeling of just being normal , " marcel said .
his classmate may said she does n't forget that marcel is in a wheelchair , but that it does n't make much of a difference in their friendship .
" i think it 's like with anybody else , " she said .
" when i 'm with other guys i act the same way . "
despite these successes only two of six classes in each grade at the school are integrated and it is not required to take on more disabled children .
slow progress germany may officially be on board with bringing differently abled children together , but it still has a relatively low rate of integration .
according to the european agency for development in special needs education , only about 15 percent of children with disabilities are educated in a regular classroom in germany .
in neighboring france and poland , for example , it 's about 31 percent and 46 percent , respectively .
according to mays , who has done his own statistical analysis for the state of north rhine-westphalia , any recent increase to germany 's level of integration is undone by the fact that more and more children who already attend regular schools are being identified as having a disability , usually a learning or emotional disability .
at the same time germans are having fewer children than in the past and the number of pupils drops each year .
" now we have the un convention for the rights of people with disabilities and germany ratified it a year ago .
we have to change our system into an inclusive system , " marcel 's mother said .
" but no one is willing , really willing to do it .
there are several examples like this school here .
they 've been doing it for many years .
but it 's just two classes per grade level that do integration .
why is n't it all of them ? "

i wanted him to go to a normal school with all his friends from the neighborhood and i did n't want him to be separated from real life . "
marcel 's mother said she 's convinced that if she had n't put up such a fight and even threatened to take the school district to court he would never have been given a spot in one of the few schools in the area that teaches the disabled and the non-disabled together .
still not an option at many schools the elementary school that refused to accept marcel years ago still does n't take kids with disabilities , saying on its website that " because this is not an integration school , we can not support children with disabilities and therefore we can not accept them . "
the school is an old , brick building in a bonn neighborhood peppered with half-timber cottages with green shutters .
inside the school , a wide staircase winds its way up four flights of stairs .
at the very top the school principal , jutta fremerey , has her office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old buildings are just one hurdle to integration in germany " we ca n't take kids in wheelchairs , just because of the building , " said fremerey .
" and there are lots of buildings in germany where it would n't be possible .
at least not yet . "
fremerey was not the principal when marcel tried to attend .
she said she supports the idea of having children with disabilities in the same classroom as children without disabilities in theory , but that a lot needs to change before that would be feasible nationwide .
she would need at least two teachers per class , she said , and one of them would have to be specially trained for teaching disabled children .
she said she 'd need small extra rooms where kids could get more personal attention and all of the lessons would have to be adapted for each of the children with disabilities .
" because there are lots and lots of totally different types of disabilities and everyone needs something different , " fremerey said .
" the blind child needs something completely different from the child who ca n't hear .
the mentally disabled child needs completely different conditions than a child with emotional or social problems .
those different requirements need to be addressed . "
according to anne waldschmidt , a professor of disability studies at the university of cologne , that kind of differentiation should be expected of a teacher .
" integration or inclusion means more personalized ways of teaching … to differentiate the subjects and the topics and to give every child the chance to learn according to personality and to individual interests and at their own pace , " she said .
" so that means the whole atmosphere is more individualized and that there is n't a standard approach . "
three adults in the classroom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in marcel 's class there are three adults to help students marcel 's school , which is also in bonn , has the manpower to do just that .
in addition to the various subject-matter teachers that teach his class math , german , english or history , a special education teacher is also present all day long .
bringing the number of adults in the classroom to three is marcel 's attendant , who only occasionally has to get marcel a book he needs but can spend the rest of the time helping other kids in the class one-on-one .
marcel is totally integrated into his class , his special education teacher daniel mays said , as are the five students with learning disabilities .
" being with the other kids , it gives you the feeling of just being normal , " marcel said .
his classmate may said she does n't forget that marcel is in a wheelchair , but that it does n't make much of a difference in their friendship .
" i think it 's like with anybody else , " she said .
" when i 'm with other guys i act the same way . "
despite these successes only two of six classes in each grade at the school are integrated and it is not required to take on more disabled children .
slow progress germany may officially be on board with bringing differently abled children together , but it still has a relatively low rate of integration .
according to the european agency for development in special needs education , only about 15 percent of children with disabilities are educated in a regular classroom in germany .
in neighboring france and poland , for example , it 's about 31 percent and 46 percent , respectively .
according to mays , who has done his own statistical analysis for the state of north rhine-westphalia , any recent increase to germany 's level of integration is undone by the fact that more and more children who already attend regular schools are being identified as having a disability , usually a learning or emotional disability .
at the same time germans are having fewer children than in the past and the number of pupils drops each year .
" now we have the un convention for the rights of people with disabilities and germany ratified it a year ago .
we have to change our system into an inclusive system , " marcel 's mother said .
" but no one is willing , really willing to do it .
there are several examples like this school here .
they 've been doing it for many years .
but it 's just two classes per grade level that do integration .
why is n't it all of them ? "

now , however , things must change because of a un convention requiring schools to accept all children . when marcel was old enough to start school , his mother picked out one of the public elementary schools in their neighborhood for him .
the school , however , said he could n't attend .
why ?
they said they were n't set up to deal with a kid in a wheelchair .
for decades that 's the way it was in germany .
children with disabilities were sent to separate schools , each one specialized for a different disability .
that is all set to change now that germany has ratified a united nations resolution that says that all children with disabilities have a right to be educated at a regular school .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel 's teacher says he 's totally integrated in his class it 's set to be a long process .
currently the majority of german children with disabilities do n't go to regular schools .
so far the city-state of bremen is the only german state to open all its schools to everyone .
in north rhine-westphalia , where marcel lives , that could be a long way off , although he did eventually find a spot in what is called an integrated or inclusive school .
" we had a hard struggle with the administration , " his mother told deutsche welle , " because i did n't want him to go to those special schools for the handicapped .

and that 's not because i dislike the locals , but because it 's rather difficult to find them .
my city is the city of everyone . it was one of those perfect early weekend mornings , when you get out of the club and can smell the fresh air again .
i opted to walk home , even though it took an eternity , instead of calling a cab or waiting for the subway .
that was the moment when i started dating my city . berlin is mean .
every encounter is a new experience and , once trapped , you never want to leave again .
i did n't find a crumbling colosseum on my way that morning , neither did i see an eiffel tower , or anything else that impresses at first glance .
instead , the smell of the cafes still open at 5 am , tired ravers ordering the famous after-party berliner currywurst at a corner stand , bizarre pieces of art in gallery windows , remains of the berlin wall turned into a canvas for graffiti - block after block , it slowly got under my skin .
it was a feeling that outdid any paris or rome . it happens to all the people i know : they move here and inevitably fall in love with the city . it 's the imperfection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't find anything like this in berlin after visiting berlin , a friend of mine decided to sell his flat in the us and move here .
he had no plans , no apartment , and no job .
but he had berlin and that was enough .
a swedish friend of mine got a great job in london after spending a few years in berlin .
she earns much more than she did here , but is still desperately looking for any reason to come back to live in her old neighborhood again . another woman i know moved here from west germany , right after the fall of the berlin wall .
" it 's the imperfection of this city that i love - the chaos that makes it so special , " she told me .
and to quote some famous berlin fans , the guys from depeche mode , one could describe this madness as " no strings attached , just free love . " berlin makes you become someone else every day , just to adapt to its myriad facets .
a journey from nonconformist prenzlauer berg , where you have to stand out to fit in , along the extravagant-trashy mitte district , and ending in fancy charlottenburg is like a trip around the world - a very inexpensive one . one minute , berlin is so german and the next minute it 's everything else : russian , french , american , british , turkish , polish .
and sooner or later it turns german again . the best part is , here you can be anything , without being judged for it .
i once heard someone on the local radio saying that berlin is the place where you do n't know if something is a piece of art or a piece of garbage . flexibility required and you have to be an artist , indeed , to appreciate thousands of paradoxes that make up this city .
here , you can spend an evening at the opera and later go to a sassy fashion show , organized in a church .
you can have a drink in one of the bars housed in the rundown tacheles building -lrb- now one of the hottest spots in berlin -rrb- and then have dinner at a restaurant just a few meters away , where the brand of your scarf will suspiciously be eyed for authenticity . leave on holiday for two weeks and your beloved bakery will turn into a shoe shop , your apartment building will start getting refurbished and the metro you usually take to work wo n't be running for the next five months , due to construction work . i had an italian colleague at the university in berlin who could n't speak a word of german -lrb- we studied in english -rrb- .
well , just one word , actually : he could perfectly pronounce the tongue-twister schienenersatzverkehr .
it means that some alternative means of transport are substituting the metro you had been counting on because the rails are currently under construction .
it also means your morning commute will be a nightmare .
i guarantee it will be one of the first words you learn when you move to berlin . bildunterschrift : berlin kept the street lights that were used in communist east germany love affair with the past berlin is someone else 's past meeting your future .
and the best place to witness that is at the flea markets .
everything related to the socialist regime is more than trendy here : plastic kitchen utensils , empty boxes of washing powder , even worn-out 30-year-old shoes .
in berlin , gdr sells . nevertheless , berlin is not entirely monogamous in its love affair with the past : there 's a market for new ideas , too .
in berlin you can even make money selling paper eyeglasses made of recycled cardboard - which have no lenses and , basically , no practical use whatsoever .
a few months ago , a young berliner started wearing them at parties , just for fun , and soon they created near hysteria in the city 's hottest clubs .
now , his so-called " pappbrille " are a viable business . sometimes , this city is such a jumbled concoction that it can overwhelm .
a local photographer once said , " i have to take berlin in small doses , so i can digest it " . but i 'm still grabbing any opportunity to date my city .
i 'm ready for its imperfection and its nasty moods ; i 'm even ready for schienenersatzverkehr and construction sites , as long as i have this beautifully arranged chaos , where garbage is art and vice versa . it 's been a few years now and i 'm far from getting bored . author : lavinia pitu editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there 's a whole other petanque culture to be found on autumn evenings along berlin 's canal banks .
