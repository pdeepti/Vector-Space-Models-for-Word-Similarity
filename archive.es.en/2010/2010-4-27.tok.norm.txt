it would reduce their bandwidth or even deny them web access .
british users and isps have begun protesting the act . britain 's digital economy bill has sparked protest and debate since its passage on april 8 .
the legislation introduces a host of new measures for the digital realm including updated videogame classifications , modified licensing procedures for broadcasters and new copyright regulations .
the bill 's provisions on downloads of copyrighted material have drawn the most public attention .
the digital economy bill requires internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to track users downloading copyrighted files and notify them of their infringement .
if users do not stop illegally downloading files after three notifications , the bill authorizes the secretary of state to impose limits on the violators ' bandwidth or to cut off their internet access entirely .
the government intends the new law to make britain more attractive to artists and others affected by copyright infringement .
fergal sharkey , who heads the group uk music , supports the bill .
" about 94 percent of song writers and composers get less than five thousand pounds a year , and 80 percent of musicians make less than fifteen thousands pounds a year .
they want a normal life , " sharkey said .
" if we want to enjoy the quality of music we have , at some point we have to start paying for it . "
false accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british parliament passed the legislation just before may 's general elections however , opponents have raised two major objections to the digital economy bill .
they view its punishments as too harsh , and , moreover , they argue that many people will be falsely accused under the new law .
for instance , those who are tech-savvy enough to be heavily involved in file sharing may just hide their activities by using other people 's internet connections , said mark mclaren of the consumer watchdog group which .
the bill includes measures that would " only identify the internet connection and provider but not identify the file sharer , " said mclaren .
british isp talk agrees and has stated it will refuse to disconnect any user 's internet service on the basis of the new act .
critics also claim the digital economy bill does not adequately address the complicated issues that go beyond file sharers hacking into other users ' connections to download .
opponents like florian leppla point to situations including on-campus computer networks or wireless hubs in libraries and cafes , where it becomes difficult to identify who downloaded what .
" the threat is that a whole library is disconnected , " said leppla of the open rights group , which opposes the legislation .
" no one can believe it , but there is no exception for libraries or universities .
this means they ca n't do their jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open rights group wants its visitors to vote against the bill 's supporters " clear and effective " appeals the bill 's authors hoped to address objections like these by specifically including what they deem a " clear and effective " appeals procedure in the legislation .
the appeals body would be independent of the isps and rights holders .
the bill 's language also makes it clear that persistent copyright violators are the target of the new law .
but leppla still worries about the ambiguity of several elements included in the digital economy .
" the period of disconnection is not defined .
whether it 's a day a week , or a year is not clear , and that 's a draconian measure for downloading a couple of songs whose market value would be ten or twenty pounds , " he said .
as for the appeals procedure , it may be tested soon .
around 200 citizens have contacted which after receiving copyright infringement letters directly from copyright holders that they say were in error .
although copyright holders will now be encouraged to work within the new legal framework , the bill does not prevent them from continuing to take private action against suspected downloaders and file sharers .

but while he applauds change , he says turbo-powered digital society needs a more human approach . with several international hits behind him and requests to perform in japan , israel , and even surinam , german performer gentleman is one of the nation 's foremost reggae artists .
he 's also grown roots of respect in the genre 's cradle , jamaica , a place he calls his second home .
born tillman otto , he sings in fluent patois .
in april , gentleman released his fifth studio album , which shot to number one .
its title , " diversity , " befits not only the variety of songs on it as gentleman branches out musically , but also how germany 's most jamaican-at-heart musician views the genre of reggae as a whole .
deutsche welle caught up with the award-winning artist who divides his time between family life in cologne and his caribbean island of choice .
click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring reggae musician gentleman .
deutsche welle : why is your new studio album , " diversity , " so different from your previous record , " another intensity , " released in 2007 ?
gentleman : when i 'm in jamaica and turn the radio on , i hear what 's getting airplay .
it has become incredibly diverse .
there are now europop / dancefloor numbers , classic roots sounds , of course , music with a hip-hop touch , elements of dub , ballads , r & b. and it 's all reggae !
naturally , you raise your standards with every album you release , but at the same time , you grow and mature .
you become more relaxed , calmer , and do n't care so much about the reggae " police . "
you have to in order to progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentleman : ' i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics ' over the past several years , reggae has become more widespread and is no longer solely popular among diehard fans .
what is better about it now ?
i ca n't say whether reggae has become better or worse .
for me , it has always been in flux .
since the days of bob marley , it has been in a constant process of change and progress .
sometimes it 's more traditional , goes back to the roots .
sometimes it 's totally modern .
it has always had that rich diversity .
in my opinion , you ca n't find that to such an extreme in any other genre of music .
why did you choose to use more electronic elements on your new album ?
for the previous albums , the band and i predominantly recorded what we played in the studio live .
there were only rare exceptions .
this time , it was different .
parts of it we recorded from playing live , but most of it was produced electronically .
you 've switched record companies and are now signed to island records , bob marley 's old label .
you have said you want to tap the american and japanese markets .
why is that so important ?
it 's a logical step .
i 've been performing for almost 20 years .
at festival gigs in america , i 've noticed there 's an intense interest in me and the music .
but that 's been under-utilized .
there 's still potential in terms of releases .
my records are n't really in many of the shops and played on the radio there .
i can sense the appetite for it and want to check it out .
you 've changed your studio approach , record company , even the band has a new lineup … .
it 'd be terrible if things did n't change .
when people say " hey , you have n't changed a bit , " i consider it more of an insult than a compliment .
life is full of change and after so many years , it 's perfectly natural .
it 's not always easy , but new beginnings often feel good .
and the time lends itself to that : a new decade , a new record label , a new band name .
musically , it 's also taking a different direction compared to the past - without neglecting the roots of course .
the record has its share of classic roots songs on it .
bildunterschrift : not every song has to have a deep message , says gentleman some people say your lyrics now contain more social critique than on earlier records .
do you agree ?
my music has often been called so positive .
i never saw it that way .
i do n't know why people thought that .
" hunky-dory , sunshine , blue skies - barefoot reggae people seeing everything through rose-colored glasses saying ' everything 's cool . " '
i 've always found the music to be political , radical and socio-critical .
i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics .
at the same time , not every song has to have a deep message ; music is primarily entertainment .
you can have the most poignant lyrics in the world , but if you do n't have the melody , no one will listen .
i am critical of the direction society is taking .
web 2.0 , for example , and interpersonal relationships .
as an artist i think you have to address such things .
they become much more bearable the moment you start talking about them - instead of pretending we 're all happy in this society preoccupied with the pursuit of pleasure , when actually there 's a much different vibe .
you just have to be honest , talk about it .
or in my case , sing about it .
why are you critical about web 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of reggae bob marley in kingston , jamaica , in 1978 it 's both a blessing and a curse .
i use it too , but i 'm not on facebook or twittering about what i do all day .
it works really well to have various musicians sending files back and forth to each other .
but the background is that you already know each other personally .
you meet face-to-face and afterwards say , " you send me your saxophone part , and you send me your guitar bit , i 'll sing over that and then you send me the final mix . "
or skyping with my kids when i 'm in jamaica … that 's exciting and cool .
what bothers me is the unbelievable divulgence of information .
we all complain about it , but we 're the ones doing it .
i 'm careful about what i post about myself .
the moment people know everything about us - our religious views , sexual preferences - we become predictable , calculable .
then we become more controllable .
the big question of the naughts is : who is controlling whom ?
it 's a bit orwellian , but we 're doing it ourselves . kids today are digital natives and have a very different relationship to the internet .
besides , there 's no stopping that development you describe … .
no , but you can show them alternatives .
there 's an incredible amount of data racing towards us , even more so to our children , and we have to filter that information .
in the old days , three tv channels were enough .
i make sure to take my son outdoors , go into the woods to build a tree house , for example .
there 's less interest in an online war game if you have other prospects and are familiar with other activities .
german r & b singer cassandra steen appears on your new record , as does african german reggae artist patrice .
how did those collaborations come about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r & b singer cassandra steen appears on gentleman 's album i first met cassandra when she was 16 , back in the days of freundeskreis -lsb- a german hip-hop group , with whom steen has sung -rsb- .
i 've always found her voice fascinating and have watched her development as a musician .
when i wrote this r & b ballad , i heard her voice in my head .
with patrice , it 'd been a typical " i 'll call you " -thing between musicians .
for ten years , we 'd been saying " let 's do a song together , " but it never panned out .
so i was in kingston , a city of millions , sitting in the back of a car stopped in rush-hour traffic .
most of the cars have tinted windows and as i rolled down my tinted window , a tinted window to the right of me rolled down at the very same moment .
who was sitting in the back of the car ?
patrice !
it was such an incredible moment .
that feeling i always have that there are no coincidences , only strokes of fate , was confirmed thousand-fold .
he was on vacation ; i was recording my album .
two days , later we were in the studio together .
the song is called " along the way . "
it all fit .
it was a very spiritual moment .
what 's the story behind the unusual eurodance track you recorded with christopher martin , a well-known musician in jamaica , but a virtual unknown in germany ?
the story is to be open to the kind of music that 's popular in jamaica right now .
that 's part of it .
i like the mix of continuous bass drum with soulful elements .
at first , i was also critical : " oh no , that typical europop sound . "
but that 's hot there right now and the song has amazing bounce .
i was in -lsb- jamaican-american reggae singer -rsb- shaggy 's studio and martin 's producers were there and thay said they wanted both of us on it .
we recorded the song and i thought it sounded so cool and fresh , i wanted to put it on my album , too .
how do you explain your affinity to kingston and jamaica , a country torn between beauty and violence ?
i think jamaica is close to life , that dichotomy is the key .
those paradoxes are what make it interesting .
just like in life .
that may sound a little overblown , but that 's how it is .
in jamaica , you feel life with a different intensity .
of course , it 's no picnic there .
sometimes it 's hard to cope with the two extremes - utter love , openness and creativity on the one hand and the unbelievably high murder rate and human ignorance on the other .
but you find good and bad everywhere in the world .
in jamaica , it 's extreme , but that 's also part of the appeal .

bildunterschrift : not every song has to have a deep message , says gentleman some people say your lyrics now contain more social critique than on earlier records .
do you agree ?
my music has often been called so positive .
i never saw it that way .
i do n't know why people thought that .
" hunky-dory , sunshine , blue skies - barefoot reggae people seeing everything through rose-colored glasses saying ' everything 's cool . " '
i 've always found the music to be political , radical and socio-critical .
i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics .
at the same time , not every song has to have a deep message ; music is primarily entertainment .
you can have the most poignant lyrics in the world , but if you do n't have the melody , no one will listen .
i am critical of the direction society is taking .
web 2.0 , for example , and interpersonal relationships .
as an artist i think you have to address such things .
they become much more bearable the moment you start talking about them - instead of pretending we 're all happy in this society preoccupied with the pursuit of pleasure , when actually there 's a much different vibe .
you just have to be honest , talk about it .
or in my case , sing about it .
why are you critical about web 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of reggae bob marley in kingston , jamaica , in 1978 it 's both a blessing and a curse .
i use it too , but i 'm not on facebook or twittering about what i do all day .
it works really well to have various musicians sending files back and forth to each other .
but the background is that you already know each other personally .
you meet face-to-face and afterwards say , " you send me your saxophone part , and you send me your guitar bit , i 'll sing over that and then you send me the final mix . "
or skyping with my kids when i 'm in jamaica … that 's exciting and cool .
what bothers me is the unbelievable divulgence of information .
we all complain about it , but we 're the ones doing it .
i 'm careful about what i post about myself .
the moment people know everything about us - our religious views , sexual preferences - we become predictable , calculable .
then we become more controllable .
the big question of the naughts is : who is controlling whom ?
it 's a bit orwellian , but we 're doing it ourselves . kids today are digital natives and have a very different relationship to the internet .
besides , there 's no stopping that development you describe … .
no , but you can show them alternatives .
there 's an incredible amount of data racing towards us , even more so to our children , and we have to filter that information .
in the old days , three tv channels were enough .
i make sure to take my son outdoors , go into the woods to build a tree house , for example .
there 's less interest in an online war game if you have other prospects and are familiar with other activities .
german r & b singer cassandra steen appears on your new record , as does african german reggae artist patrice .
how did those collaborations come about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r & b singer cassandra steen appears on gentleman 's album i first met cassandra when she was 16 , back in the days of freundeskreis -lsb- a german hip-hop group , with whom steen has sung -rsb- .
i 've always found her voice fascinating and have watched her development as a musician .
when i wrote this r & b ballad , i heard her voice in my head .
with patrice , it 'd been a typical " i 'll call you " -thing between musicians .
for ten years , we 'd been saying " let 's do a song together , " but it never panned out .
so i was in kingston , a city of millions , sitting in the back of a car stopped in rush-hour traffic .
most of the cars have tinted windows and as i rolled down my tinted window , a tinted window to the right of me rolled down at the very same moment .
who was sitting in the back of the car ?
patrice !
it was such an incredible moment .
that feeling i always have that there are no coincidences , only strokes of fate , was confirmed thousand-fold .
he was on vacation ; i was recording my album .
two days , later we were in the studio together .
the song is called " along the way . "
it all fit .
it was a very spiritual moment .
what 's the story behind the unusual eurodance track you recorded with christopher martin , a well-known musician in jamaica , but a virtual unknown in germany ?
the story is to be open to the kind of music that 's popular in jamaica right now .
that 's part of it .
i like the mix of continuous bass drum with soulful elements .
at first , i was also critical : " oh no , that typical europop sound . "
but that 's hot there right now and the song has amazing bounce .
i was in -lsb- jamaican-american reggae singer -rsb- shaggy 's studio and martin 's producers were there and thay said they wanted both of us on it .
we recorded the song and i thought it sounded so cool and fresh , i wanted to put it on my album , too .
how do you explain your affinity to kingston and jamaica , a country torn between beauty and violence ?
i think jamaica is close to life , that dichotomy is the key .
those paradoxes are what make it interesting .
just like in life .
that may sound a little overblown , but that 's how it is .
in jamaica , you feel life with a different intensity .
of course , it 's no picnic there .
sometimes it 's hard to cope with the two extremes - utter love , openness and creativity on the one hand and the unbelievably high murder rate and human ignorance on the other .
but you find good and bad everywhere in the world .
in jamaica , it 's extreme , but that 's also part of the appeal .

the devaluation of the country 's currency at the end of last year has even worsened the food supply for the people . mobile phones are no longer novelty items in pyongyang .
there are around 100,000 mobile phone users in the north korean capital alone .
and on the streets , there are more than just old busses – now there are mercedes , bmws , audis and even porsches .
but these status symbols are only meant for the political elite .
in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .
" i am going to be honest , " jin says . " we made this change because inflation was far too high by the end of last year .
we want to protect our national currency and that is the reason we did it .
and then it turned out some of the experts had made mistakes .
so it was a bit chaotic but we could also see there was a tremendous amount of support for general kim jong il . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il posing for photos with the new chinese ambassador in march apparently the government official who was responsible for the chaos was put to death in march .
still , not much business has returned to tongil market in the north korean capital .
but just beyond the city limits , there are the occasional street merchants with folding tables and a few goods .
trying to woo investors people can buy nearly everything in pyongyang for money , but the prices are sky-high .
the country is in an extremely tight economic situation , which is why its leaders are putting more effort into attracting international investors .
" we have recently emphasized our wish to welcome investors here . "
as general secretary of the german-korean friendship association , jin myong o is especially interested in attracting investors from germany , with which north korea has had diplomatic relations now for almost a decade .
" in these almost 10 years , we have come very far with germany and we would say that our relationship with germany is a good example for other european countries . "
north korean officials are reluctant to talk about politics such as atomic bomb testing or the south korean patrol boat that sank near the border just recently .
but regarding the possible succession to kim jong il , officials say that a special postage stamp honoring his youngest son kim jong un , is being planned .
according to rumors , the 28-year-old is slated to succeed the self-styled great general , who has been experiencing health problems .

it would reduce their bandwidth or even deny them web access .
british users and isps have begun protesting the act . britain 's digital economy bill has sparked protest and debate since its passage on april 8 .
the legislation introduces a host of new measures for the digital realm including updated videogame classifications , modified licensing procedures for broadcasters and new copyright regulations .
the bill 's provisions on downloads of copyrighted material have drawn the most public attention .
the digital economy bill requires internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to track users downloading copyrighted files and notify them of their infringement .
if users do not stop illegally downloading files after three notifications , the bill authorizes the secretary of state to impose limits on the violators ' bandwidth or to cut off their internet access entirely .
the government intends the new law to make britain more attractive to artists and others affected by copyright infringement .
fergal sharkey , who heads the group uk music , supports the bill .
" about 94 percent of song writers and composers get less than five thousand pounds a year , and 80 percent of musicians make less than fifteen thousands pounds a year .
they want a normal life , " sharkey said .
" if we want to enjoy the quality of music we have , at some point we have to start paying for it . "
false accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british parliament passed the legislation just before may 's general elections however , opponents have raised two major objections to the digital economy bill .
they view its punishments as too harsh , and , moreover , they argue that many people will be falsely accused under the new law .
for instance , those who are tech-savvy enough to be heavily involved in file sharing may just hide their activities by using other people 's internet connections , said mark mclaren of the consumer watchdog group which .
the bill includes measures that would " only identify the internet connection and provider but not identify the file sharer , " said mclaren .
british isp talk agrees and has stated it will refuse to disconnect any user 's internet service on the basis of the new act .
critics also claim the digital economy bill does not adequately address the complicated issues that go beyond file sharers hacking into other users ' connections to download .
opponents like florian leppla point to situations including on-campus computer networks or wireless hubs in libraries and cafes , where it becomes difficult to identify who downloaded what .
" the threat is that a whole library is disconnected , " said leppla of the open rights group , which opposes the legislation .
" no one can believe it , but there is no exception for libraries or universities .
this means they ca n't do their jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open rights group wants its visitors to vote against the bill 's supporters " clear and effective " appeals the bill 's authors hoped to address objections like these by specifically including what they deem a " clear and effective " appeals procedure in the legislation .
the appeals body would be independent of the isps and rights holders .
the bill 's language also makes it clear that persistent copyright violators are the target of the new law .
but leppla still worries about the ambiguity of several elements included in the digital economy .
" the period of disconnection is not defined .
whether it 's a day a week , or a year is not clear , and that 's a draconian measure for downloading a couple of songs whose market value would be ten or twenty pounds , " he said .
as for the appeals procedure , it may be tested soon .
around 200 citizens have contacted which after receiving copyright infringement letters directly from copyright holders that they say were in error .
although copyright holders will now be encouraged to work within the new legal framework , the bill does not prevent them from continuing to take private action against suspected downloaders and file sharers .

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democrats say the crucifixes in public schools are there to stay the response from the cdu was quick and clear .
" when it comes to religious neutrality , i have a fundamentally different view , " said armin laschet , the integration minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" i 'll say it very clearly : we 're keeping the crosses up in the schools of north rhine-westphalia . "
oezkan later apologized to her colleagues in hanover for the friction her comments had caused .
" ms. oezkan accepts that in lower saxony the crucifix is both welcome and desired in schools , " wulff said .
" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .
" she had to take it back , but i think she was right , " kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany .
integration in action but wulff , kolat , laschet and other cdu members agree that oezkan 's appointment is a good sign for germany .
saarland 's state premier peter mueller , told the newspaper the saarbruecker zeitung that he thought oezkan was a good choice .
" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .
a cabinet shakeup oezkan and three other ministers were appointed last week by wulff in a cabinet reshuffle .
all are expected to be approved by the state parliament where a coalition majority of cdu and the free democrats rules .
oezkan was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants and is a trained lawyer .
she has been the cdu 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg. hf / apn / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "

" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democrats say the crucifixes in public schools are there to stay the response from the cdu was quick and clear .

" i 'll say it very clearly : we 're keeping the crosses up in the schools of north rhine-westphalia . "
oezkan later apologized to her colleagues in hanover for the friction her comments had caused .
" ms. oezkan accepts that in lower saxony the crucifix is both welcome and desired in schools , " wulff said .
" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .

injury-hit bayern travel to lyon with a 1-0 advantage for the second leg of the champions league semi-final on tuesday hoping to book a place in the final of europe 's most prestigious tournament . bayern munich coach louis van gaal played down the injury problems facing his team ahead of tuesday 's champions league semi-final second leg in lyon .
van gaal told a news conference he did not know if injured defenders martin demichelis , daniel van buyten and diego contento would recover in time for tuesday 's crunch match .
" i 've come here with 17 players and i can only field 11 so if i miss the three others , i 'll still have 14 available players , " van gaal said .
bayern will also be without franck ribery , who was sent off in the first leg match at the allianz arena in munich .
bayern may be on course for another bundesliga title this season , but only managed a draw against lowly borussia monchengladbach on saturday . however , a similar result on tuesday would book their place in the champions league final on may 22 in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach van gaal says bayern is strong-willed " we are not the kind of team whose aim is just to avoid conceding goals when we enter the field .
i 've never told my players to play like that since the beginning of the season and i wo n't start now , " van gaalsaid .
fellow dutchman mark van bommel was also optimistic about his team 's chances of reaching the final .
" we have often conceded goals in away games this season but that 's not a problem because even if we concede six goals tomorrow and we score five , we 're through , " the bayern captain said .
keeping a clean sheet would be enough to see bayern through to the final , the team said on its website , but van gaal is looking for an away goal : “ we don ’ t have the team to play for a clean sheet .
we ’ ve not tried that all season , and we won ’ t try it tomorrow . ”

the alpha ventus wind park , germany 's first project of this type built offshore , is located 45 kilometers north of the german island of borkum in the north sea .

alpha ventus is a collaborative effort by german energy giants e.on and ewe and swedish firm vattenfall .
the project was delayed as a result of bad weather and technical difficulties .
according to germany 's office of sea navigation and hydrography , up to 25 off-shore wind farms involving more than 1,650 turbines have been approved for construction in the north sea and baltic sea .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .
so we 're grateful that the americans are helping us to compensate for this . " it is planned that the us soldiers will also train the local police and enable them to hold an area after the anti-insurgency operation is over .
the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .
so we 're grateful that the americans are helping us to compensate for this . " it is planned that the us soldiers will also train the local police and enable them to hold an area after the anti-insurgency operation is over .
the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 27.04.2010 deutsche bahn heads down transparency track großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all-aboard for compliance : deutsche bahn moves ahead europe 's biggest railway company , deutsche bahn , has called in auditors to investigate bribery allegations at its international consulting arm .
compliance experts say the move is part of a positive management trend . under its new management team , deutsche bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market . the state-owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , deutsche bahn international , by hiring professional services group kpmg to conduct a special audit .
new evidence uncovered the unit , which offers consultancy services worldwide to governments and other bodies planning and building railways , has been under investigation since 2005 for allegedly bribing officials in algeria , greece and rwanda .
but new evidence uncovered by prosecutors in frankfurt and presented to deutsche bahn last week prompted a decision for " swift action , " company spokesman jens-oliver voss told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn spied on staff in a scandal that forced ceo mehdorn to resign voss said deutsche bahn has a fundamental interest in uncovering the truth about the transactions , noting that the company itself brought details of irregularities to the attention of prosecutors last year .
its new senior management team , he added , " has given compliance the highest possible priority . "
in march 2009 , hartmut mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of deutsche bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
his successor ruediger grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .
besides the new board position , grube has hired additional compliance staff and introduced training courses to " modernize compliance " and ensure that business practices across the company meet all legal requirements , according to peter von blomberg with transparency international , an organization that fights global corruption .
" over the past 12 months , deutsche bahn has done very much in the area of compliance , " he told deutsche welle .
" but it still needs to implement some steps . "
siemens scandal fallout numerous german companies with large international operations have given compliance and anti-corruption initiatives greater focus following the siemens scandal over bribes for international engineering contracts , according to von blomberg .
" this scandal created a lot of attention – negative attention – and resulted in numerous german companies taking a tougher stance on fighting corruption , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens scandal has prompted tough anti-corruption action deutsche bahn has ambitious international expansion plans .
on thursday , the railway company agreed to buy british train and bus operator arriva in a strategic push to expand in europe 's increasingly open rail markets .
and the company appears to be aware that as it grows abroad , so , too , do the opportunities for corruption .
earlier last week , deutsche bahn joined siemens , daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in russia .
both siemens and daimler have also been involved in large-scale bribery cases in russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

and eu defense minister agreed to meet regularly to discuss how to react more swiftly to conflicts or catastrophes . nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on monday urged members countries to pool their resources if the alliance was to successfully deal with threats of the 21st century .
the key to tackling the challenges of modern warfare was working together to build weapons and systems that are compatible and therefore cheaper in the long run , the nato chief told the belgian high institute for defense in brussels .
" we should work harder to find solutions to fundamental problems between the eu and nato , " he said .
in the past , eu defense ministers met on average just once every six months on the sidelines of eu foreign minister meetings .
spainish defense minister carme chacon , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said that there was general agreement on meeting more frequently , as stipulated in the lisbon treaty .
faced with a crippling economic recession , national governments have been under intense pressure to cut back on public expenditure and implement military spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : costing 100 million euros each the eurofighter is the biggest european arms project " i understand that there are strong national interests at work here , and in the current economic climate , there is a real danger of protectionism , " nato chief rasmussen said .
" but we must resist these temptations - purely national thinking is no longer affordable . " financial pool rasmussen said nato allies should give up on expensive national arms programs if it would make more economic sense to set up shared ones .
as part of a new strategy to abandon cold war structures and standardize costs , he also proposed setting up a joint financial pool to finance future military missions .
the failure to standardize equipment , from helicopters to combat vehicles was also adding to costs and putting lives at risk , rasmussen added .
" we must overhaul our defense industrial markets - particularly here in europe - to reduce the fragmentation and make them stronger , " he said .
" it makes no sense for europe to have 16 naval shipyards and 12 separate manufacturers of armored vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato members are protective of their national defence industries afghanistan policing the nato secretary general outlined concrete measures that included sharing tasks in afghanistan between the european union and the military alliance in training police .
rasmussen said he had proposed that the eu concentrate on the civilian aspects of policing in afghanistan like criminal investigation or justice reforms and for nato to focus on the more challenging aspects of the isaf mission .
costly lessons at a meeting of european defense ministers in luxembourg , eda chief alexander weis called for greater cooperation between eu member states in the development of unmanned drones .
weis , who used to be deputy national armanents director in the german ministry of defense , recalled how 25 years ago , six eu countries collaborated in the development of three fighter jets . he told the ministers that the development of eurofighter , rafale and viggen had cost around 25 billion euros .
the european union could have saved a lot of money and were now in a similar situation with the drones .
the european defense agency was established by the council of minister in 2004 to support the member states and the council in their effort to improve european defense capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the european security and defense policy. nrt / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democrats say the crucifixes in public schools are there to stay the response from the cdu was quick and clear .
" when it comes to religious neutrality , i have a fundamentally different view , " said armin laschet , the integration minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" i 'll say it very clearly : we 're keeping the crosses up in the schools of north rhine-westphalia . "
oezkan later apologized to her colleagues in hanover for the friction her comments had caused .
" ms. oezkan accepts that in lower saxony the crucifix is both welcome and desired in schools , " wulff said .
" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .
" she had to take it back , but i think she was right , " kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany .
integration in action but wulff , kolat , laschet and other cdu members agree that oezkan 's appointment is a good sign for germany .
saarland 's state premier peter mueller , told the newspaper the saarbruecker zeitung that he thought oezkan was a good choice .
" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .
a cabinet shakeup oezkan and three other ministers were appointed last week by wulff in a cabinet reshuffle .
all are expected to be approved by the state parliament where a coalition majority of cdu and the free democrats rules .
oezkan was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants and is a trained lawyer .
she has been the cdu 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg. hf / apn / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .
bicycle-friendly copenhagen large cities are ahead of the game particularly when it comes to transport policies .
one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .
for most people in the city , the next bus or train stop is n't more than 300 meters away .
two busses with diesel hybrid engines already ply the roads - eight more are planned .
bildunterschrift : hamburg has one of the best public transport systems " we 're now massively expanding our bicycle transportation network , " said volker duman , a spokesman from the city 's environment agency .
" and hamburg 's regional train network only runs on green energy from hydropower - the first german rail company to do so . "
the city is hoping to achieve an ambitious climate goal - it plans to slash carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
it 's already taken a first step toward that goal .
the city 's per-capita emission rate has already sunk 15 percent compared to 1990 levels .
" it 's a significant success for the city , " according to the eu commission .

but while he applauds change , he says turbo-powered digital society needs a more human approach . with several international hits behind him and requests to perform in japan , israel , and even surinam , german performer gentleman is one of the nation 's foremost reggae artists .
he 's also grown roots of respect in the genre 's cradle , jamaica , a place he calls his second home .
born tillman otto , he sings in fluent patois .
in april , gentleman released his fifth studio album , which shot to number one .
its title , " diversity , " befits not only the variety of songs on it as gentleman branches out musically , but also how germany 's most jamaican-at-heart musician views the genre of reggae as a whole .
deutsche welle caught up with the award-winning artist who divides his time between family life in cologne and his caribbean island of choice .
click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring reggae musician gentleman .
deutsche welle : why is your new studio album , " diversity , " so different from your previous record , " another intensity , " released in 2007 ?
gentleman : when i 'm in jamaica and turn the radio on , i hear what 's getting airplay .
it has become incredibly diverse .
there are now europop / dancefloor numbers , classic roots sounds , of course , music with a hip-hop touch , elements of dub , ballads , r & b. and it 's all reggae !
naturally , you raise your standards with every album you release , but at the same time , you grow and mature .
you become more relaxed , calmer , and do n't care so much about the reggae " police . "
you have to in order to progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentleman : ' i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics ' over the past several years , reggae has become more widespread and is no longer solely popular among diehard fans .
what is better about it now ?
i ca n't say whether reggae has become better or worse .
for me , it has always been in flux .
since the days of bob marley , it has been in a constant process of change and progress .
sometimes it 's more traditional , goes back to the roots .
sometimes it 's totally modern .
it has always had that rich diversity .
in my opinion , you ca n't find that to such an extreme in any other genre of music .
why did you choose to use more electronic elements on your new album ?
for the previous albums , the band and i predominantly recorded what we played in the studio live .
there were only rare exceptions .
this time , it was different .
parts of it we recorded from playing live , but most of it was produced electronically .
you 've switched record companies and are now signed to island records , bob marley 's old label .
you have said you want to tap the american and japanese markets .
why is that so important ?
it 's a logical step .
i 've been performing for almost 20 years .
at festival gigs in america , i 've noticed there 's an intense interest in me and the music .
but that 's been under-utilized .
there 's still potential in terms of releases .
my records are n't really in many of the shops and played on the radio there .
i can sense the appetite for it and want to check it out .
you 've changed your studio approach , record company , even the band has a new lineup … .
it 'd be terrible if things did n't change .
when people say " hey , you have n't changed a bit , " i consider it more of an insult than a compliment .
life is full of change and after so many years , it 's perfectly natural .
it 's not always easy , but new beginnings often feel good .
and the time lends itself to that : a new decade , a new record label , a new band name .
musically , it 's also taking a different direction compared to the past - without neglecting the roots of course .
the record has its share of classic roots songs on it .
bildunterschrift : not every song has to have a deep message , says gentleman some people say your lyrics now contain more social critique than on earlier records .
do you agree ?
my music has often been called so positive .
i never saw it that way .
i do n't know why people thought that .
" hunky-dory , sunshine , blue skies - barefoot reggae people seeing everything through rose-colored glasses saying ' everything 's cool . " '
i 've always found the music to be political , radical and socio-critical .
i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics .
at the same time , not every song has to have a deep message ; music is primarily entertainment .
you can have the most poignant lyrics in the world , but if you do n't have the melody , no one will listen .
i am critical of the direction society is taking .
web 2.0 , for example , and interpersonal relationships .
as an artist i think you have to address such things .
they become much more bearable the moment you start talking about them - instead of pretending we 're all happy in this society preoccupied with the pursuit of pleasure , when actually there 's a much different vibe .
you just have to be honest , talk about it .
or in my case , sing about it .
why are you critical about web 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of reggae bob marley in kingston , jamaica , in 1978 it 's both a blessing and a curse .
i use it too , but i 'm not on facebook or twittering about what i do all day .
it works really well to have various musicians sending files back and forth to each other .
but the background is that you already know each other personally .
you meet face-to-face and afterwards say , " you send me your saxophone part , and you send me your guitar bit , i 'll sing over that and then you send me the final mix . "
or skyping with my kids when i 'm in jamaica … that 's exciting and cool .
what bothers me is the unbelievable divulgence of information .
we all complain about it , but we 're the ones doing it .
i 'm careful about what i post about myself .
the moment people know everything about us - our religious views , sexual preferences - we become predictable , calculable .
then we become more controllable .
the big question of the naughts is : who is controlling whom ?
it 's a bit orwellian , but we 're doing it ourselves . kids today are digital natives and have a very different relationship to the internet .
besides , there 's no stopping that development you describe … .
no , but you can show them alternatives .
there 's an incredible amount of data racing towards us , even more so to our children , and we have to filter that information .
in the old days , three tv channels were enough .
i make sure to take my son outdoors , go into the woods to build a tree house , for example .
there 's less interest in an online war game if you have other prospects and are familiar with other activities .
german r & b singer cassandra steen appears on your new record , as does african german reggae artist patrice .
how did those collaborations come about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r & b singer cassandra steen appears on gentleman 's album i first met cassandra when she was 16 , back in the days of freundeskreis -lsb- a german hip-hop group , with whom steen has sung -rsb- .
i 've always found her voice fascinating and have watched her development as a musician .
when i wrote this r & b ballad , i heard her voice in my head .
with patrice , it 'd been a typical " i 'll call you " -thing between musicians .
for ten years , we 'd been saying " let 's do a song together , " but it never panned out .
so i was in kingston , a city of millions , sitting in the back of a car stopped in rush-hour traffic .
most of the cars have tinted windows and as i rolled down my tinted window , a tinted window to the right of me rolled down at the very same moment .
who was sitting in the back of the car ?
patrice !
it was such an incredible moment .
that feeling i always have that there are no coincidences , only strokes of fate , was confirmed thousand-fold .
he was on vacation ; i was recording my album .
two days , later we were in the studio together .
the song is called " along the way . "
it all fit .
it was a very spiritual moment .
what 's the story behind the unusual eurodance track you recorded with christopher martin , a well-known musician in jamaica , but a virtual unknown in germany ?
the story is to be open to the kind of music that 's popular in jamaica right now .
that 's part of it .
i like the mix of continuous bass drum with soulful elements .
at first , i was also critical : " oh no , that typical europop sound . "
but that 's hot there right now and the song has amazing bounce .
i was in -lsb- jamaican-american reggae singer -rsb- shaggy 's studio and martin 's producers were there and thay said they wanted both of us on it .
we recorded the song and i thought it sounded so cool and fresh , i wanted to put it on my album , too .
how do you explain your affinity to kingston and jamaica , a country torn between beauty and violence ?
i think jamaica is close to life , that dichotomy is the key .
those paradoxes are what make it interesting .
just like in life .
that may sound a little overblown , but that 's how it is .
in jamaica , you feel life with a different intensity .
of course , it 's no picnic there .
sometimes it 's hard to cope with the two extremes - utter love , openness and creativity on the one hand and the unbelievably high murder rate and human ignorance on the other .
but you find good and bad everywhere in the world .
in jamaica , it 's extreme , but that 's also part of the appeal .

the devaluation of the country 's currency at the end of last year has even worsened the food supply for the people . mobile phones are no longer novelty items in pyongyang .
there are around 100,000 mobile phone users in the north korean capital alone .
and on the streets , there are more than just old busses – now there are mercedes , bmws , audis and even porsches .
but these status symbols are only meant for the political elite .
in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .
" i am going to be honest , " jin says . " we made this change because inflation was far too high by the end of last year .
we want to protect our national currency and that is the reason we did it .
and then it turned out some of the experts had made mistakes .
so it was a bit chaotic but we could also see there was a tremendous amount of support for general kim jong il . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il posing for photos with the new chinese ambassador in march apparently the government official who was responsible for the chaos was put to death in march .
still , not much business has returned to tongil market in the north korean capital .
but just beyond the city limits , there are the occasional street merchants with folding tables and a few goods .
trying to woo investors people can buy nearly everything in pyongyang for money , but the prices are sky-high .
the country is in an extremely tight economic situation , which is why its leaders are putting more effort into attracting international investors .
" we have recently emphasized our wish to welcome investors here . "
as general secretary of the german-korean friendship association , jin myong o is especially interested in attracting investors from germany , with which north korea has had diplomatic relations now for almost a decade .
" in these almost 10 years , we have come very far with germany and we would say that our relationship with germany is a good example for other european countries . "
north korean officials are reluctant to talk about politics such as atomic bomb testing or the south korean patrol boat that sank near the border just recently .
but regarding the possible succession to kim jong il , officials say that a special postage stamp honoring his youngest son kim jong un , is being planned .
according to rumors , the 28-year-old is slated to succeed the self-styled great general , who has been experiencing health problems .

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democrats say the crucifixes in public schools are there to stay the response from the cdu was quick and clear .
" when it comes to religious neutrality , i have a fundamentally different view , " said armin laschet , the integration minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" i 'll say it very clearly : we 're keeping the crosses up in the schools of north rhine-westphalia . "
oezkan later apologized to her colleagues in hanover for the friction her comments had caused .
" ms. oezkan accepts that in lower saxony the crucifix is both welcome and desired in schools , " wulff said .
" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .
" she had to take it back , but i think she was right , " kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany .
integration in action but wulff , kolat , laschet and other cdu members agree that oezkan 's appointment is a good sign for germany .
saarland 's state premier peter mueller , told the newspaper the saarbruecker zeitung that he thought oezkan was a good choice .
" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .
a cabinet shakeup oezkan and three other ministers were appointed last week by wulff in a cabinet reshuffle .
all are expected to be approved by the state parliament where a coalition majority of cdu and the free democrats rules .
oezkan was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants and is a trained lawyer .
she has been the cdu 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg. hf / apn / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would reduce their bandwidth or even deny them web access .
british users and isps have begun protesting the act . britain 's digital economy bill has sparked protest and debate since its passage on april 8 .
the legislation introduces a host of new measures for the digital realm including updated videogame classifications , modified licensing procedures for broadcasters and new copyright regulations .
the bill 's provisions on downloads of copyrighted material have drawn the most public attention .
the digital economy bill requires internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to track users downloading copyrighted files and notify them of their infringement .
if users do not stop illegally downloading files after three notifications , the bill authorizes the secretary of state to impose limits on the violators ' bandwidth or to cut off their internet access entirely .
the government intends the new law to make britain more attractive to artists and others affected by copyright infringement .
fergal sharkey , who heads the group uk music , supports the bill .
" about 94 percent of song writers and composers get less than five thousand pounds a year , and 80 percent of musicians make less than fifteen thousands pounds a year .
they want a normal life , " sharkey said .
" if we want to enjoy the quality of music we have , at some point we have to start paying for it . "
false accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british parliament passed the legislation just before may 's general elections however , opponents have raised two major objections to the digital economy bill .
they view its punishments as too harsh , and , moreover , they argue that many people will be falsely accused under the new law .
for instance , those who are tech-savvy enough to be heavily involved in file sharing may just hide their activities by using other people 's internet connections , said mark mclaren of the consumer watchdog group which .
the bill includes measures that would " only identify the internet connection and provider but not identify the file sharer , " said mclaren .
british isp talk agrees and has stated it will refuse to disconnect any user 's internet service on the basis of the new act .
critics also claim the digital economy bill does not adequately address the complicated issues that go beyond file sharers hacking into other users ' connections to download .
opponents like florian leppla point to situations including on-campus computer networks or wireless hubs in libraries and cafes , where it becomes difficult to identify who downloaded what .
" the threat is that a whole library is disconnected , " said leppla of the open rights group , which opposes the legislation .
" no one can believe it , but there is no exception for libraries or universities .
this means they ca n't do their jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open rights group wants its visitors to vote against the bill 's supporters " clear and effective " appeals the bill 's authors hoped to address objections like these by specifically including what they deem a " clear and effective " appeals procedure in the legislation .
the appeals body would be independent of the isps and rights holders .
the bill 's language also makes it clear that persistent copyright violators are the target of the new law .
but leppla still worries about the ambiguity of several elements included in the digital economy .
" the period of disconnection is not defined .
whether it 's a day a week , or a year is not clear , and that 's a draconian measure for downloading a couple of songs whose market value would be ten or twenty pounds , " he said .
as for the appeals procedure , it may be tested soon .
around 200 citizens have contacted which after receiving copyright infringement letters directly from copyright holders that they say were in error .
although copyright holders will now be encouraged to work within the new legal framework , the bill does not prevent them from continuing to take private action against suspected downloaders and file sharers .

but while he applauds change , he says turbo-powered digital society needs a more human approach . with several international hits behind him and requests to perform in japan , israel , and even surinam , german performer gentleman is one of the nation 's foremost reggae artists .
he 's also grown roots of respect in the genre 's cradle , jamaica , a place he calls his second home .
born tillman otto , he sings in fluent patois .
in april , gentleman released his fifth studio album , which shot to number one .
its title , " diversity , " befits not only the variety of songs on it as gentleman branches out musically , but also how germany 's most jamaican-at-heart musician views the genre of reggae as a whole .
deutsche welle caught up with the award-winning artist who divides his time between family life in cologne and his caribbean island of choice .
click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring reggae musician gentleman .
deutsche welle : why is your new studio album , " diversity , " so different from your previous record , " another intensity , " released in 2007 ?
gentleman : when i 'm in jamaica and turn the radio on , i hear what 's getting airplay .
it has become incredibly diverse .
there are now europop / dancefloor numbers , classic roots sounds , of course , music with a hip-hop touch , elements of dub , ballads , r & b. and it 's all reggae !
naturally , you raise your standards with every album you release , but at the same time , you grow and mature .
you become more relaxed , calmer , and do n't care so much about the reggae " police . "
you have to in order to progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentleman : ' i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics ' over the past several years , reggae has become more widespread and is no longer solely popular among diehard fans .
what is better about it now ?
i ca n't say whether reggae has become better or worse .
for me , it has always been in flux .
since the days of bob marley , it has been in a constant process of change and progress .
sometimes it 's more traditional , goes back to the roots .
sometimes it 's totally modern .
it has always had that rich diversity .
in my opinion , you ca n't find that to such an extreme in any other genre of music .
why did you choose to use more electronic elements on your new album ?
for the previous albums , the band and i predominantly recorded what we played in the studio live .
there were only rare exceptions .
this time , it was different .
parts of it we recorded from playing live , but most of it was produced electronically .
you 've switched record companies and are now signed to island records , bob marley 's old label .
you have said you want to tap the american and japanese markets .
why is that so important ?
it 's a logical step .
i 've been performing for almost 20 years .
at festival gigs in america , i 've noticed there 's an intense interest in me and the music .
but that 's been under-utilized .
there 's still potential in terms of releases .
my records are n't really in many of the shops and played on the radio there .
i can sense the appetite for it and want to check it out .
you 've changed your studio approach , record company , even the band has a new lineup … .
it 'd be terrible if things did n't change .
when people say " hey , you have n't changed a bit , " i consider it more of an insult than a compliment .
life is full of change and after so many years , it 's perfectly natural .
it 's not always easy , but new beginnings often feel good .
and the time lends itself to that : a new decade , a new record label , a new band name .
musically , it 's also taking a different direction compared to the past - without neglecting the roots of course .
the record has its share of classic roots songs on it .
bildunterschrift : not every song has to have a deep message , says gentleman some people say your lyrics now contain more social critique than on earlier records .
do you agree ?
my music has often been called so positive .
i never saw it that way .
i do n't know why people thought that .
" hunky-dory , sunshine , blue skies - barefoot reggae people seeing everything through rose-colored glasses saying ' everything 's cool . " '
i 've always found the music to be political , radical and socio-critical .
i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics .
at the same time , not every song has to have a deep message ; music is primarily entertainment .
you can have the most poignant lyrics in the world , but if you do n't have the melody , no one will listen .
i am critical of the direction society is taking .
web 2.0 , for example , and interpersonal relationships .
as an artist i think you have to address such things .
they become much more bearable the moment you start talking about them - instead of pretending we 're all happy in this society preoccupied with the pursuit of pleasure , when actually there 's a much different vibe .
you just have to be honest , talk about it .
or in my case , sing about it .
why are you critical about web 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of reggae bob marley in kingston , jamaica , in 1978 it 's both a blessing and a curse .
i use it too , but i 'm not on facebook or twittering about what i do all day .
it works really well to have various musicians sending files back and forth to each other .
but the background is that you already know each other personally .
you meet face-to-face and afterwards say , " you send me your saxophone part , and you send me your guitar bit , i 'll sing over that and then you send me the final mix . "
or skyping with my kids when i 'm in jamaica … that 's exciting and cool .
what bothers me is the unbelievable divulgence of information .
we all complain about it , but we 're the ones doing it .
i 'm careful about what i post about myself .
the moment people know everything about us - our religious views , sexual preferences - we become predictable , calculable .
then we become more controllable .
the big question of the naughts is : who is controlling whom ?
it 's a bit orwellian , but we 're doing it ourselves . kids today are digital natives and have a very different relationship to the internet .
besides , there 's no stopping that development you describe … .
no , but you can show them alternatives .
there 's an incredible amount of data racing towards us , even more so to our children , and we have to filter that information .
in the old days , three tv channels were enough .
i make sure to take my son outdoors , go into the woods to build a tree house , for example .
there 's less interest in an online war game if you have other prospects and are familiar with other activities .
german r & b singer cassandra steen appears on your new record , as does african german reggae artist patrice .
how did those collaborations come about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r & b singer cassandra steen appears on gentleman 's album i first met cassandra when she was 16 , back in the days of freundeskreis -lsb- a german hip-hop group , with whom steen has sung -rsb- .
i 've always found her voice fascinating and have watched her development as a musician .
when i wrote this r & b ballad , i heard her voice in my head .
with patrice , it 'd been a typical " i 'll call you " -thing between musicians .
for ten years , we 'd been saying " let 's do a song together , " but it never panned out .
so i was in kingston , a city of millions , sitting in the back of a car stopped in rush-hour traffic .
most of the cars have tinted windows and as i rolled down my tinted window , a tinted window to the right of me rolled down at the very same moment .
who was sitting in the back of the car ?
patrice !
it was such an incredible moment .
that feeling i always have that there are no coincidences , only strokes of fate , was confirmed thousand-fold .
he was on vacation ; i was recording my album .
two days , later we were in the studio together .
the song is called " along the way . "
it all fit .
it was a very spiritual moment .
what 's the story behind the unusual eurodance track you recorded with christopher martin , a well-known musician in jamaica , but a virtual unknown in germany ?
the story is to be open to the kind of music that 's popular in jamaica right now .
that 's part of it .
i like the mix of continuous bass drum with soulful elements .
at first , i was also critical : " oh no , that typical europop sound . "
but that 's hot there right now and the song has amazing bounce .
i was in -lsb- jamaican-american reggae singer -rsb- shaggy 's studio and martin 's producers were there and thay said they wanted both of us on it .
we recorded the song and i thought it sounded so cool and fresh , i wanted to put it on my album , too .
how do you explain your affinity to kingston and jamaica , a country torn between beauty and violence ?
i think jamaica is close to life , that dichotomy is the key .
those paradoxes are what make it interesting .
just like in life .
that may sound a little overblown , but that 's how it is .
in jamaica , you feel life with a different intensity .
of course , it 's no picnic there .
sometimes it 's hard to cope with the two extremes - utter love , openness and creativity on the one hand and the unbelievably high murder rate and human ignorance on the other .
but you find good and bad everywhere in the world .
in jamaica , it 's extreme , but that 's also part of the appeal .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentleman : ' i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics ' over the past several years , reggae has become more widespread and is no longer solely popular among diehard fans .
what is better about it now ?
i ca n't say whether reggae has become better or worse .
for me , it has always been in flux .
since the days of bob marley , it has been in a constant process of change and progress .
sometimes it 's more traditional , goes back to the roots .
sometimes it 's totally modern .
it has always had that rich diversity .
in my opinion , you ca n't find that to such an extreme in any other genre of music .
why did you choose to use more electronic elements on your new album ?
for the previous albums , the band and i predominantly recorded what we played in the studio live .
there were only rare exceptions .
this time , it was different .
parts of it we recorded from playing live , but most of it was produced electronically .
you 've switched record companies and are now signed to island records , bob marley 's old label .
you have said you want to tap the american and japanese markets .
why is that so important ?
it 's a logical step .
i 've been performing for almost 20 years .
at festival gigs in america , i 've noticed there 's an intense interest in me and the music .
but that 's been under-utilized .
there 's still potential in terms of releases .
my records are n't really in many of the shops and played on the radio there .
i can sense the appetite for it and want to check it out .
you 've changed your studio approach , record company , even the band has a new lineup … .
it 'd be terrible if things did n't change .
when people say " hey , you have n't changed a bit , " i consider it more of an insult than a compliment .
life is full of change and after so many years , it 's perfectly natural .
it 's not always easy , but new beginnings often feel good .
and the time lends itself to that : a new decade , a new record label , a new band name .
musically , it 's also taking a different direction compared to the past - without neglecting the roots of course .
the record has its share of classic roots songs on it .
bildunterschrift : not every song has to have a deep message , says gentleman some people say your lyrics now contain more social critique than on earlier records .
do you agree ?
my music has often been called so positive .
i never saw it that way .
i do n't know why people thought that .
" hunky-dory , sunshine , blue skies - barefoot reggae people seeing everything through rose-colored glasses saying ' everything 's cool . " '
i 've always found the music to be political , radical and socio-critical .
i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics .
at the same time , not every song has to have a deep message ; music is primarily entertainment .
you can have the most poignant lyrics in the world , but if you do n't have the melody , no one will listen .
i am critical of the direction society is taking .
web 2.0 , for example , and interpersonal relationships .
as an artist i think you have to address such things .
they become much more bearable the moment you start talking about them - instead of pretending we 're all happy in this society preoccupied with the pursuit of pleasure , when actually there 's a much different vibe .
you just have to be honest , talk about it .
or in my case , sing about it .
why are you critical about web 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of reggae bob marley in kingston , jamaica , in 1978 it 's both a blessing and a curse .
i use it too , but i 'm not on facebook or twittering about what i do all day .
it works really well to have various musicians sending files back and forth to each other .
but the background is that you already know each other personally .
you meet face-to-face and afterwards say , " you send me your saxophone part , and you send me your guitar bit , i 'll sing over that and then you send me the final mix . "
or skyping with my kids when i 'm in jamaica … that 's exciting and cool .
what bothers me is the unbelievable divulgence of information .
we all complain about it , but we 're the ones doing it .
i 'm careful about what i post about myself .
the moment people know everything about us - our religious views , sexual preferences - we become predictable , calculable .
then we become more controllable .
the big question of the naughts is : who is controlling whom ?
it 's a bit orwellian , but we 're doing it ourselves . kids today are digital natives and have a very different relationship to the internet .
besides , there 's no stopping that development you describe … .
no , but you can show them alternatives .
there 's an incredible amount of data racing towards us , even more so to our children , and we have to filter that information .
in the old days , three tv channels were enough .
i make sure to take my son outdoors , go into the woods to build a tree house , for example .
there 's less interest in an online war game if you have other prospects and are familiar with other activities .
german r & b singer cassandra steen appears on your new record , as does african german reggae artist patrice .
how did those collaborations come about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r & b singer cassandra steen appears on gentleman 's album i first met cassandra when she was 16 , back in the days of freundeskreis -lsb- a german hip-hop group , with whom steen has sung -rsb- .
i 've always found her voice fascinating and have watched her development as a musician .
when i wrote this r & b ballad , i heard her voice in my head .
with patrice , it 'd been a typical " i 'll call you " -thing between musicians .
for ten years , we 'd been saying " let 's do a song together , " but it never panned out .
so i was in kingston , a city of millions , sitting in the back of a car stopped in rush-hour traffic .
most of the cars have tinted windows and as i rolled down my tinted window , a tinted window to the right of me rolled down at the very same moment .
who was sitting in the back of the car ?
patrice !
it was such an incredible moment .
that feeling i always have that there are no coincidences , only strokes of fate , was confirmed thousand-fold .
he was on vacation ; i was recording my album .
two days , later we were in the studio together .
the song is called " along the way . "
it all fit .
it was a very spiritual moment .
what 's the story behind the unusual eurodance track you recorded with christopher martin , a well-known musician in jamaica , but a virtual unknown in germany ?
the story is to be open to the kind of music that 's popular in jamaica right now .
that 's part of it .
i like the mix of continuous bass drum with soulful elements .
at first , i was also critical : " oh no , that typical europop sound . "
but that 's hot there right now and the song has amazing bounce .
i was in -lsb- jamaican-american reggae singer -rsb- shaggy 's studio and martin 's producers were there and thay said they wanted both of us on it .
we recorded the song and i thought it sounded so cool and fresh , i wanted to put it on my album , too .
how do you explain your affinity to kingston and jamaica , a country torn between beauty and violence ?
i think jamaica is close to life , that dichotomy is the key .
those paradoxes are what make it interesting .
just like in life .
that may sound a little overblown , but that 's how it is .
in jamaica , you feel life with a different intensity .
of course , it 's no picnic there .
sometimes it 's hard to cope with the two extremes - utter love , openness and creativity on the one hand and the unbelievably high murder rate and human ignorance on the other .
but you find good and bad everywhere in the world .
in jamaica , it 's extreme , but that 's also part of the appeal .

but while he applauds change , he says turbo-powered digital society needs a more human approach . with several international hits behind him and requests to perform in japan , israel , and even surinam , german performer gentleman is one of the nation 's foremost reggae artists .
he 's also grown roots of respect in the genre 's cradle , jamaica , a place he calls his second home .
born tillman otto , he sings in fluent patois .
in april , gentleman released his fifth studio album , which shot to number one .
its title , " diversity , " befits not only the variety of songs on it as gentleman branches out musically , but also how germany 's most jamaican-at-heart musician views the genre of reggae as a whole .
deutsche welle caught up with the award-winning artist who divides his time between family life in cologne and his caribbean island of choice .
click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring reggae musician gentleman .
deutsche welle : why is your new studio album , " diversity , " so different from your previous record , " another intensity , " released in 2007 ?
gentleman : when i 'm in jamaica and turn the radio on , i hear what 's getting airplay .
it has become incredibly diverse .
there are now europop / dancefloor numbers , classic roots sounds , of course , music with a hip-hop touch , elements of dub , ballads , r & b. and it 's all reggae !
naturally , you raise your standards with every album you release , but at the same time , you grow and mature .
you become more relaxed , calmer , and do n't care so much about the reggae " police . "
you have to in order to progress .

there 's less interest in an online war game if you have other prospects and are familiar with other activities .
german r & b singer cassandra steen appears on your new record , as does african german reggae artist patrice .
how did those collaborations come about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r & b singer cassandra steen appears on gentleman 's album i first met cassandra when she was 16 , back in the days of freundeskreis -lsb- a german hip-hop group , with whom steen has sung -rsb- .
i 've always found her voice fascinating and have watched her development as a musician .
when i wrote this r & b ballad , i heard her voice in my head .
with patrice , it 'd been a typical " i 'll call you " -thing between musicians .
for ten years , we 'd been saying " let 's do a song together , " but it never panned out .
so i was in kingston , a city of millions , sitting in the back of a car stopped in rush-hour traffic .
most of the cars have tinted windows and as i rolled down my tinted window , a tinted window to the right of me rolled down at the very same moment .
who was sitting in the back of the car ?
patrice !
it was such an incredible moment .
that feeling i always have that there are no coincidences , only strokes of fate , was confirmed thousand-fold .
he was on vacation ; i was recording my album .
two days , later we were in the studio together .
the song is called " along the way . "
it all fit .
it was a very spiritual moment .
what 's the story behind the unusual eurodance track you recorded with christopher martin , a well-known musician in jamaica , but a virtual unknown in germany ?
the story is to be open to the kind of music that 's popular in jamaica right now .
that 's part of it .
i like the mix of continuous bass drum with soulful elements .
at first , i was also critical : " oh no , that typical europop sound . "
but that 's hot there right now and the song has amazing bounce .
i was in -lsb- jamaican-american reggae singer -rsb- shaggy 's studio and martin 's producers were there and thay said they wanted both of us on it .
we recorded the song and i thought it sounded so cool and fresh , i wanted to put it on my album , too .
how do you explain your affinity to kingston and jamaica , a country torn between beauty and violence ?
i think jamaica is close to life , that dichotomy is the key .
those paradoxes are what make it interesting .
just like in life .
that may sound a little overblown , but that 's how it is .
in jamaica , you feel life with a different intensity .
of course , it 's no picnic there .
sometimes it 's hard to cope with the two extremes - utter love , openness and creativity on the one hand and the unbelievably high murder rate and human ignorance on the other .
but you find good and bad everywhere in the world .
in jamaica , it 's extreme , but that 's also part of the appeal .

but while he applauds change , he says turbo-powered digital society needs a more human approach . with several international hits behind him and requests to perform in japan , israel , and even surinam , german performer gentleman is one of the nation 's foremost reggae artists .
he 's also grown roots of respect in the genre 's cradle , jamaica , a place he calls his second home .
born tillman otto , he sings in fluent patois .
in april , gentleman released his fifth studio album , which shot to number one .
its title , " diversity , " befits not only the variety of songs on it as gentleman branches out musically , but also how germany 's most jamaican-at-heart musician views the genre of reggae as a whole .
deutsche welle caught up with the award-winning artist who divides his time between family life in cologne and his caribbean island of choice .
click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring reggae musician gentleman .
deutsche welle : why is your new studio album , " diversity , " so different from your previous record , " another intensity , " released in 2007 ?
gentleman : when i 'm in jamaica and turn the radio on , i hear what 's getting airplay .
it has become incredibly diverse .
there are now europop / dancefloor numbers , classic roots sounds , of course , music with a hip-hop touch , elements of dub , ballads , r & b. and it 's all reggae !
naturally , you raise your standards with every album you release , but at the same time , you grow and mature .
you become more relaxed , calmer , and do n't care so much about the reggae " police . "
you have to in order to progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentleman : ' i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics ' over the past several years , reggae has become more widespread and is no longer solely popular among diehard fans .
what is better about it now ?
i ca n't say whether reggae has become better or worse .
for me , it has always been in flux .
since the days of bob marley , it has been in a constant process of change and progress .
sometimes it 's more traditional , goes back to the roots .
sometimes it 's totally modern .
it has always had that rich diversity .
in my opinion , you ca n't find that to such an extreme in any other genre of music .
why did you choose to use more electronic elements on your new album ?
for the previous albums , the band and i predominantly recorded what we played in the studio live .
there were only rare exceptions .
this time , it was different .
parts of it we recorded from playing live , but most of it was produced electronically .
you 've switched record companies and are now signed to island records , bob marley 's old label .
you have said you want to tap the american and japanese markets .
why is that so important ?
it 's a logical step .
i 've been performing for almost 20 years .
at festival gigs in america , i 've noticed there 's an intense interest in me and the music .
but that 's been under-utilized .
there 's still potential in terms of releases .
my records are n't really in many of the shops and played on the radio there .
i can sense the appetite for it and want to check it out .
you 've changed your studio approach , record company , even the band has a new lineup … .
it 'd be terrible if things did n't change .
when people say " hey , you have n't changed a bit , " i consider it more of an insult than a compliment .
life is full of change and after so many years , it 's perfectly natural .
it 's not always easy , but new beginnings often feel good .
and the time lends itself to that : a new decade , a new record label , a new band name .
musically , it 's also taking a different direction compared to the past - without neglecting the roots of course .
the record has its share of classic roots songs on it .
bildunterschrift : not every song has to have a deep message , says gentleman some people say your lyrics now contain more social critique than on earlier records .
do you agree ?
my music has often been called so positive .
i never saw it that way .
i do n't know why people thought that .
" hunky-dory , sunshine , blue skies - barefoot reggae people seeing everything through rose-colored glasses saying ' everything 's cool . " '
i 've always found the music to be political , radical and socio-critical .
i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics .
at the same time , not every song has to have a deep message ; music is primarily entertainment .
you can have the most poignant lyrics in the world , but if you do n't have the melody , no one will listen .
i am critical of the direction society is taking .
web 2.0 , for example , and interpersonal relationships .
as an artist i think you have to address such things .
they become much more bearable the moment you start talking about them - instead of pretending we 're all happy in this society preoccupied with the pursuit of pleasure , when actually there 's a much different vibe .
you just have to be honest , talk about it .
or in my case , sing about it .
why are you critical about web 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of reggae bob marley in kingston , jamaica , in 1978 it 's both a blessing and a curse .
i use it too , but i 'm not on facebook or twittering about what i do all day .
it works really well to have various musicians sending files back and forth to each other .
but the background is that you already know each other personally .
you meet face-to-face and afterwards say , " you send me your saxophone part , and you send me your guitar bit , i 'll sing over that and then you send me the final mix . "
or skyping with my kids when i 'm in jamaica … that 's exciting and cool .
what bothers me is the unbelievable divulgence of information .
we all complain about it , but we 're the ones doing it .
i 'm careful about what i post about myself .
the moment people know everything about us - our religious views , sexual preferences - we become predictable , calculable .
then we become more controllable .
the big question of the naughts is : who is controlling whom ?
it 's a bit orwellian , but we 're doing it ourselves . kids today are digital natives and have a very different relationship to the internet .
besides , there 's no stopping that development you describe … .
no , but you can show them alternatives .
there 's an incredible amount of data racing towards us , even more so to our children , and we have to filter that information .
in the old days , three tv channels were enough .
i make sure to take my son outdoors , go into the woods to build a tree house , for example .

but while he applauds change , he says turbo-powered digital society needs a more human approach . with several international hits behind him and requests to perform in japan , israel , and even surinam , german performer gentleman is one of the nation 's foremost reggae artists .
he 's also grown roots of respect in the genre 's cradle , jamaica , a place he calls his second home .
born tillman otto , he sings in fluent patois .
in april , gentleman released his fifth studio album , which shot to number one .
its title , " diversity , " befits not only the variety of songs on it as gentleman branches out musically , but also how germany 's most jamaican-at-heart musician views the genre of reggae as a whole .
deutsche welle caught up with the award-winning artist who divides his time between family life in cologne and his caribbean island of choice .
click on the link below to listen to dw-radio 's hits in germany , featuring reggae musician gentleman .
deutsche welle : why is your new studio album , " diversity , " so different from your previous record , " another intensity , " released in 2007 ?
gentleman : when i 'm in jamaica and turn the radio on , i hear what 's getting airplay .
it has become incredibly diverse .
there are now europop / dancefloor numbers , classic roots sounds , of course , music with a hip-hop touch , elements of dub , ballads , r & b. and it 's all reggae !
naturally , you raise your standards with every album you release , but at the same time , you grow and mature .
you become more relaxed , calmer , and do n't care so much about the reggae " police . "
you have to in order to progress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentleman : ' i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics ' over the past several years , reggae has become more widespread and is no longer solely popular among diehard fans .
what is better about it now ?
i ca n't say whether reggae has become better or worse .
for me , it has always been in flux .
since the days of bob marley , it has been in a constant process of change and progress .
sometimes it 's more traditional , goes back to the roots .
sometimes it 's totally modern .
it has always had that rich diversity .
in my opinion , you ca n't find that to such an extreme in any other genre of music .
why did you choose to use more electronic elements on your new album ?
for the previous albums , the band and i predominantly recorded what we played in the studio live .
there were only rare exceptions .
this time , it was different .
parts of it we recorded from playing live , but most of it was produced electronically .
you 've switched record companies and are now signed to island records , bob marley 's old label .
you have said you want to tap the american and japanese markets .
why is that so important ?
it 's a logical step .
i 've been performing for almost 20 years .
at festival gigs in america , i 've noticed there 's an intense interest in me and the music .
but that 's been under-utilized .
there 's still potential in terms of releases .
my records are n't really in many of the shops and played on the radio there .
i can sense the appetite for it and want to check it out .
you 've changed your studio approach , record company , even the band has a new lineup … .
it 'd be terrible if things did n't change .
when people say " hey , you have n't changed a bit , " i consider it more of an insult than a compliment .
life is full of change and after so many years , it 's perfectly natural .
it 's not always easy , but new beginnings often feel good .
and the time lends itself to that : a new decade , a new record label , a new band name .
musically , it 's also taking a different direction compared to the past - without neglecting the roots of course .
the record has its share of classic roots songs on it .
bildunterschrift : not every song has to have a deep message , says gentleman some people say your lyrics now contain more social critique than on earlier records .
do you agree ?
my music has often been called so positive .
i never saw it that way .
i do n't know why people thought that .
" hunky-dory , sunshine , blue skies - barefoot reggae people seeing everything through rose-colored glasses saying ' everything 's cool . " '
i 've always found the music to be political , radical and socio-critical .
i aim for a certain standard in my lyrics .
at the same time , not every song has to have a deep message ; music is primarily entertainment .
you can have the most poignant lyrics in the world , but if you do n't have the melody , no one will listen .
i am critical of the direction society is taking .
web 2.0 , for example , and interpersonal relationships .
as an artist i think you have to address such things .
they become much more bearable the moment you start talking about them - instead of pretending we 're all happy in this society preoccupied with the pursuit of pleasure , when actually there 's a much different vibe .
you just have to be honest , talk about it .
or in my case , sing about it .
why are you critical about web 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of reggae bob marley in kingston , jamaica , in 1978 it 's both a blessing and a curse .
i use it too , but i 'm not on facebook or twittering about what i do all day .
it works really well to have various musicians sending files back and forth to each other .
but the background is that you already know each other personally .
you meet face-to-face and afterwards say , " you send me your saxophone part , and you send me your guitar bit , i 'll sing over that and then you send me the final mix . "
or skyping with my kids when i 'm in jamaica … that 's exciting and cool .
what bothers me is the unbelievable divulgence of information .
we all complain about it , but we 're the ones doing it .
i 'm careful about what i post about myself .
the moment people know everything about us - our religious views , sexual preferences - we become predictable , calculable .
then we become more controllable .
the big question of the naughts is : who is controlling whom ?
it 's a bit orwellian , but we 're doing it ourselves . kids today are digital natives and have a very different relationship to the internet .
besides , there 's no stopping that development you describe … .
no , but you can show them alternatives .
there 's an incredible amount of data racing towards us , even more so to our children , and we have to filter that information .
in the old days , three tv channels were enough .
i make sure to take my son outdoors , go into the woods to build a tree house , for example .
there 's less interest in an online war game if you have other prospects and are familiar with other activities .
german r & b singer cassandra steen appears on your new record , as does african german reggae artist patrice .
how did those collaborations come about ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : r & b singer cassandra steen appears on gentleman 's album i first met cassandra when she was 16 , back in the days of freundeskreis -lsb- a german hip-hop group , with whom steen has sung -rsb- .
i 've always found her voice fascinating and have watched her development as a musician .
when i wrote this r & b ballad , i heard her voice in my head .
with patrice , it 'd been a typical " i 'll call you " -thing between musicians .
for ten years , we 'd been saying " let 's do a song together , " but it never panned out .
so i was in kingston , a city of millions , sitting in the back of a car stopped in rush-hour traffic .
most of the cars have tinted windows and as i rolled down my tinted window , a tinted window to the right of me rolled down at the very same moment .
who was sitting in the back of the car ?
patrice !
it was such an incredible moment .
that feeling i always have that there are no coincidences , only strokes of fate , was confirmed thousand-fold .
he was on vacation ; i was recording my album .
two days , later we were in the studio together .
the song is called " along the way . "
it all fit .
it was a very spiritual moment .
what 's the story behind the unusual eurodance track you recorded with christopher martin , a well-known musician in jamaica , but a virtual unknown in germany ?
the story is to be open to the kind of music that 's popular in jamaica right now .
that 's part of it .
i like the mix of continuous bass drum with soulful elements .
at first , i was also critical : " oh no , that typical europop sound . "
but that 's hot there right now and the song has amazing bounce .
i was in -lsb- jamaican-american reggae singer -rsb- shaggy 's studio and martin 's producers were there and thay said they wanted both of us on it .
we recorded the song and i thought it sounded so cool and fresh , i wanted to put it on my album , too .
how do you explain your affinity to kingston and jamaica , a country torn between beauty and violence ?
i think jamaica is close to life , that dichotomy is the key .
those paradoxes are what make it interesting .
just like in life .
that may sound a little overblown , but that 's how it is .
in jamaica , you feel life with a different intensity .
of course , it 's no picnic there .
sometimes it 's hard to cope with the two extremes - utter love , openness and creativity on the one hand and the unbelievably high murder rate and human ignorance on the other .
but you find good and bad everywhere in the world .
in jamaica , it 's extreme , but that 's also part of the appeal .

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "

the lending status for portugal was also downgraded . stocks fell in europe and on wall street after credit rating agency standard and poor 's cut its credit rating on greece to junk status on tuesday .
the news means that lending to the country is considered to be speculative rather than an investment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal also had its debt rating reduced greece 's outlook was " negative " , a statement from the agency said .
it added that the country 's status could be downgraded further " if the greek government 's ability to implement its fiscal and structural reform program materially weakens in our view . "
that would occur , the agency said , if the greek government was " undermined by domestic political opposition at home or by even weaker economic conditions than we currently assume . "
in an attempt to quell concerns , european union president herman van rompuy said that the negotiations for the aid to greece were going according to plan .
speaking during an official visit in tokyo wednesday morning , van rompuy stressed " there is no question about restructuring " greek debt with aid negotiations under way and " well on track . "
challenges faced by greece greece has been hit by a series of strikes in recent months in protest against the introduction of austerity measures .
" the downgrade results from our updated assessment of the political , economic and budgetary challenges that the greek government faces in its efforts -lrb- to cut debt -rrb- , " standard and poor 's credit analyst marko mrsnik said .
" we believe that the government 's policy options are narrowing because of greece 's weakening economic growth prospects , at a time when pressures for stronger fiscal adjustment measures are rising , " the statement continued .

" given our inability to access the markets , " said greek finance minister george papaconstantinou , " the procedure must be complete , agreed , signed and the release of funds initiated from the imf and our european peers . "
in its downgrade of portugal , standard and poor 's cited concerns about the country 's ability to deal with high debt levels in view of the country 's weak economic outlook .
it cut the rating by two notches to a level that is four notches above junk status . european equities suffered their biggest losses in two months , with the europe-wide ftseurofirst 300 index closing down 3.07 percent. rc / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the speaker hid behind umbrellas as eggs began to fly the deal is the first concrete sign of the more friendly approach to russia under newly-elected president viktor yanukovych .
the agreement , also ratified by russia 's lower house of parliament , extends the russian navy 's lease at the port of sevastopol for 25 years after the current lease expires in 2017 .

in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .
" i am going to be honest , " jin says . " we made this change because inflation was far too high by the end of last year .

" in these almost 10 years , we have come very far with germany and we would say that our relationship with germany is a good example for other european countries . "
north korean officials are reluctant to talk about politics such as atomic bomb testing or the south korean patrol boat that sank near the border just recently .
but regarding the possible succession to kim jong il , officials say that a special postage stamp honoring his youngest son kim jong un , is being planned .
according to rumors , the 28-year-old is slated to succeed the self-styled great general , who has been experiencing health problems .

van gaal told a news conference he did not know if injured defenders martin demichelis , daniel van buyten and diego contento would recover in time for tuesday 's crunch match .
" i 've come here with 17 players and i can only field 11 so if i miss the three others , i 'll still have 14 available players , " van gaal said .
bayern will also be without franck ribery , who was sent off in the first leg match at the allianz arena in munich .
bayern may be on course for another bundesliga title this season , but only managed a draw against lowly borussia monchengladbach on saturday . however , a similar result on tuesday would book their place in the champions league final on may 22 in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach van gaal says bayern is strong-willed " we are not the kind of team whose aim is just to avoid conceding goals when we enter the field .
i 've never told my players to play like that since the beginning of the season and i wo n't start now , " van gaalsaid .
fellow dutchman mark van bommel was also optimistic about his team 's chances of reaching the final .
" we have often conceded goals in away games this season but that 's not a problem because even if we concede six goals tomorrow and we score five , we 're through , " the bayern captain said .
keeping a clean sheet would be enough to see bayern through to the final , the team said on its website , but van gaal is looking for an away goal : “ we don ’ t have the team to play for a clean sheet .
we ’ ve not tried that all season , and we won ’ t try it tomorrow . ”
" when i was a coach in the netherlands and my team had to play against a german one , i used to tell my players that they had to be ready to play until the very end of the game .
bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's franck ribery was sent off in the first leg french underdogs despite the french side 's status as underdogs , bayern players have a lot of lot of respect for lyon after they gained a shock second-leg draw against real madrid saw them progress to the quarter-finals , where they eased past bordeaux .
" 1-0 is obviously helpful , but it 's not over yet .
we 'll need all the determination we have , ” said bastian schweinsteiger .
goalkeeper jörg butt called on the team to produce a top performance .
" we ca n't take anything for granted .
lyon have a very good team , and they knocked out real madrid .
we 'll have to work hard for 90 minutes , maybe even 120 , " he said .
lyon coach claude puel warned bayern they would be facing a different side in tuesday 's second-leg semi-final .
" bayern feel confident , that 's fair enough ... but we know we are able to overcome any european opponent if we play at our real level , " puel told reporters .
" we 've had to go through difficult moments this season in the champions league and we 've always been able to raise our level each time we had to , " he added. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we should work harder to find solutions to fundamental problems between the eu and nato , " he said .
in the past , eu defense ministers met on average just once every six months on the sidelines of eu foreign minister meetings .

several black umbrellas protected parliament speaker volodymyr litvyn from the paper wads and eggs being thrown at him , while other deputies held their noses or put on masks against the smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the speaker hid behind umbrellas as eggs began to fly the deal is the first concrete sign of the more friendly approach to russia under newly-elected president viktor yanukovych .
the agreement , also ratified by russia 's lower house of parliament , extends the russian navy 's lease at the port of sevastopol for 25 years after the current lease expires in 2017 .
the deal was signed by yanukovych and russian president dmitry medvedev last week and has been heavily criticized by supporters of yanukovych 's pro-western predecessor viktor yushchenko .
outside the parliament building , they shouted " death to traitors ! " and " crimea is ours . "
russia willing to pay big money base lease in exchange for the lease extension , russia is giving ukraine a 30 percent discount on russian natural gas imports , a pledge worth some 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- over 10 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich promised to restore relations with russia earlier on tuesday , russian prime minister vladimir putin held talks with ukrainian leaders in kiev at which he offered an unprecedented nuclear cooperation deal .
he admitted to reporters that the gas deal had hurt the russian budget .
" it 's going to be a burden , of course .
and a major one , " he said .
" the amount that this has cost us is really something else .
for this kind of money i could have eaten yanukovych and your prime minister together . "
russia 's supply of natural gas to ukraine has been cut three times in recent years over disagreements on payments from ukraine .
european union officials stepped in during the most recent standoff in 2009 when moscow 's decision to halt gas flowing through ukrainian pipes led to shortages in the eu. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.04.2010 german troops skeptical of " partnering " with afghan forces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a burned out german military vehicle in afghanistan 's kunduz province the international troops have decided on a new strategy to improve stability in afghanistan .
as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .
so we 're grateful that the americans are helping us to compensate for this . " it is planned that the us soldiers will also train the local police and enable them to hold an area after the anti-insurgency operation is over .
the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

the alpha ventus wind park , germany 's first project of this type built offshore , is located 45 kilometers north of the german island of borkum in the north sea .
data collected from its 12 turbines are expected to help green energy specialists improve technology and construction methods for future off-shore wind farm projects .

alpha ventus is a collaborative effort by german energy giants e.on and ewe and swedish firm vattenfall .
the project was delayed as a result of bad weather and technical difficulties .
according to germany 's office of sea navigation and hydrography , up to 25 off-shore wind farms involving more than 1,650 turbines have been approved for construction in the north sea and baltic sea .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .
so we 're grateful that the americans are helping us to compensate for this . " it is planned that the us soldiers will also train the local police and enable them to hold an area after the anti-insurgency operation is over .
the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .
so we 're grateful that the americans are helping us to compensate for this . " it is planned that the us soldiers will also train the local police and enable them to hold an area after the anti-insurgency operation is over .
the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.04.2010 german troops skeptical of " partnering " with afghan forces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a burned out german military vehicle in afghanistan 's kunduz province the international troops have decided on a new strategy to improve stability in afghanistan .
as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democrats say the crucifixes in public schools are there to stay the response from the cdu was quick and clear .
" when it comes to religious neutrality , i have a fundamentally different view , " said armin laschet , the integration minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" i 'll say it very clearly : we 're keeping the crosses up in the schools of north rhine-westphalia . "
oezkan later apologized to her colleagues in hanover for the friction her comments had caused .
" ms. oezkan accepts that in lower saxony the crucifix is both welcome and desired in schools , " wulff said .
" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .
" she had to take it back , but i think she was right , " kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany .
integration in action but wulff , kolat , laschet and other cdu members agree that oezkan 's appointment is a good sign for germany .
saarland 's state premier peter mueller , told the newspaper the saarbruecker zeitung that he thought oezkan was a good choice .
" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .
a cabinet shakeup oezkan and three other ministers were appointed last week by wulff in a cabinet reshuffle .

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democrats say the crucifixes in public schools are there to stay the response from the cdu was quick and clear .
" when it comes to religious neutrality , i have a fundamentally different view , " said armin laschet , the integration minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" i 'll say it very clearly : we 're keeping the crosses up in the schools of north rhine-westphalia . "
oezkan later apologized to her colleagues in hanover for the friction her comments had caused .
" ms. oezkan accepts that in lower saxony the crucifix is both welcome and desired in schools , " wulff said .
" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .
" she had to take it back , but i think she was right , " kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany .
integration in action but wulff , kolat , laschet and other cdu members agree that oezkan 's appointment is a good sign for germany .
saarland 's state premier peter mueller , told the newspaper the saarbruecker zeitung that he thought oezkan was a good choice .
" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .
a cabinet shakeup oezkan and three other ministers were appointed last week by wulff in a cabinet reshuffle .
all are expected to be approved by the state parliament where a coalition majority of cdu and the free democrats rules .
oezkan was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants and is a trained lawyer .
she has been the cdu 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg. hf / apn / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alpha ventus wind park , germany 's first project of this type built offshore , is located 45 kilometers north of the german island of borkum in the north sea .
data collected from its 12 turbines are expected to help green energy specialists improve technology and construction methods for future off-shore wind farm projects .
" the use of wind energy will play a central role in the energy mix of the future , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who was on site to initiate the wind farm 's turbines .
alpha ventus is a collaborative effort by german energy giants e.on and ewe and swedish firm vattenfall .
the project was delayed as a result of bad weather and technical difficulties .
according to germany 's office of sea navigation and hydrography , up to 25 off-shore wind farms involving more than 1,650 turbines have been approved for construction in the north sea and baltic sea .

the devaluation of the country 's currency at the end of last year has even worsened the food supply for the people . mobile phones are no longer novelty items in pyongyang .
there are around 100,000 mobile phone users in the north korean capital alone .
and on the streets , there are more than just old busses – now there are mercedes , bmws , audis and even porsches .
but these status symbols are only meant for the political elite .
in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .
" i am going to be honest , " jin says . " we made this change because inflation was far too high by the end of last year .
we want to protect our national currency and that is the reason we did it .
and then it turned out some of the experts had made mistakes .
so it was a bit chaotic but we could also see there was a tremendous amount of support for general kim jong il . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il posing for photos with the new chinese ambassador in march apparently the government official who was responsible for the chaos was put to death in march .
still , not much business has returned to tongil market in the north korean capital .
but just beyond the city limits , there are the occasional street merchants with folding tables and a few goods .
trying to woo investors people can buy nearly everything in pyongyang for money , but the prices are sky-high .
the country is in an extremely tight economic situation , which is why its leaders are putting more effort into attracting international investors .
" we have recently emphasized our wish to welcome investors here . "
as general secretary of the german-korean friendship association , jin myong o is especially interested in attracting investors from germany , with which north korea has had diplomatic relations now for almost a decade .
" in these almost 10 years , we have come very far with germany and we would say that our relationship with germany is a good example for other european countries . "
north korean officials are reluctant to talk about politics such as atomic bomb testing or the south korean patrol boat that sank near the border just recently .
but regarding the possible succession to kim jong il , officials say that a special postage stamp honoring his youngest son kim jong un , is being planned .
according to rumors , the 28-year-old is slated to succeed the self-styled great general , who has been experiencing health problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 27.04.2010 deutsche bahn heads down transparency track großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all-aboard for compliance : deutsche bahn moves ahead europe 's biggest railway company , deutsche bahn , has called in auditors to investigate bribery allegations at its international consulting arm .
compliance experts say the move is part of a positive management trend . under its new management team , deutsche bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market . the state-owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , deutsche bahn international , by hiring professional services group kpmg to conduct a special audit .
new evidence uncovered the unit , which offers consultancy services worldwide to governments and other bodies planning and building railways , has been under investigation since 2005 for allegedly bribing officials in algeria , greece and rwanda .
but new evidence uncovered by prosecutors in frankfurt and presented to deutsche bahn last week prompted a decision for " swift action , " company spokesman jens-oliver voss told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn spied on staff in a scandal that forced ceo mehdorn to resign voss said deutsche bahn has a fundamental interest in uncovering the truth about the transactions , noting that the company itself brought details of irregularities to the attention of prosecutors last year .
its new senior management team , he added , " has given compliance the highest possible priority . "
in march 2009 , hartmut mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of deutsche bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
his successor ruediger grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .
besides the new board position , grube has hired additional compliance staff and introduced training courses to " modernize compliance " and ensure that business practices across the company meet all legal requirements , according to peter von blomberg with transparency international , an organization that fights global corruption .
" over the past 12 months , deutsche bahn has done very much in the area of compliance , " he told deutsche welle .
" but it still needs to implement some steps . "
siemens scandal fallout numerous german companies with large international operations have given compliance and anti-corruption initiatives greater focus following the siemens scandal over bribes for international engineering contracts , according to von blomberg .
" this scandal created a lot of attention – negative attention – and resulted in numerous german companies taking a tougher stance on fighting corruption , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens scandal has prompted tough anti-corruption action deutsche bahn has ambitious international expansion plans .
on thursday , the railway company agreed to buy british train and bus operator arriva in a strategic push to expand in europe 's increasingly open rail markets .
and the company appears to be aware that as it grows abroad , so , too , do the opportunities for corruption .
earlier last week , deutsche bahn joined siemens , daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in russia .
both siemens and daimler have also been involved in large-scale bribery cases in russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .
bicycle-friendly copenhagen large cities are ahead of the game particularly when it comes to transport policies .
one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .
for most people in the city , the next bus or train stop is n't more than 300 meters away .
two busses with diesel hybrid engines already ply the roads - eight more are planned .
bildunterschrift : hamburg has one of the best public transport systems " we 're now massively expanding our bicycle transportation network , " said volker duman , a spokesman from the city 's environment agency .
" and hamburg 's regional train network only runs on green energy from hydropower - the first german rail company to do so . "
the city is hoping to achieve an ambitious climate goal - it plans to slash carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
it 's already taken a first step toward that goal .
the city 's per-capita emission rate has already sunk 15 percent compared to 1990 levels .
" it 's a significant success for the city , " according to the eu commission .

one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .
for most people in the city , the next bus or train stop is n't more than 300 meters away .
two busses with diesel hybrid engines already ply the roads - eight more are planned .
bildunterschrift : hamburg has one of the best public transport systems " we 're now massively expanding our bicycle transportation network , " said volker duman , a spokesman from the city 's environment agency .
" and hamburg 's regional train network only runs on green energy from hydropower - the first german rail company to do so . "
the city is hoping to achieve an ambitious climate goal - it plans to slash carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
it 's already taken a first step toward that goal .
the city 's per-capita emission rate has already sunk 15 percent compared to 1990 levels .
" it 's a significant success for the city , " according to the eu commission .

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .

van gaal told a news conference he did not know if injured defenders martin demichelis , daniel van buyten and diego contento would recover in time for tuesday 's crunch match .
" i 've come here with 17 players and i can only field 11 so if i miss the three others , i 'll still have 14 available players , " van gaal said .
bayern will also be without franck ribery , who was sent off in the first leg match at the allianz arena in munich .
bayern may be on course for another bundesliga title this season , but only managed a draw against lowly borussia monchengladbach on saturday . however , a similar result on tuesday would book their place in the champions league final on may 22 in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach van gaal says bayern is strong-willed " we are not the kind of team whose aim is just to avoid conceding goals when we enter the field .
i 've never told my players to play like that since the beginning of the season and i wo n't start now , " van gaalsaid .
fellow dutchman mark van bommel was also optimistic about his team 's chances of reaching the final .
" we have often conceded goals in away games this season but that 's not a problem because even if we concede six goals tomorrow and we score five , we 're through , " the bayern captain said .
keeping a clean sheet would be enough to see bayern through to the final , the team said on its website , but van gaal is looking for an away goal : “ we don ’ t have the team to play for a clean sheet .
we ’ ve not tried that all season , and we won ’ t try it tomorrow . ”
" when i was a coach in the netherlands and my team had to play against a german one , i used to tell my players that they had to be ready to play until the very end of the game .
bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's franck ribery was sent off in the first leg french underdogs despite the french side 's status as underdogs , bayern players have a lot of lot of respect for lyon after they gained a shock second-leg draw against real madrid saw them progress to the quarter-finals , where they eased past bordeaux .
" 1-0 is obviously helpful , but it 's not over yet .
we 'll need all the determination we have , ” said bastian schweinsteiger .
goalkeeper jörg butt called on the team to produce a top performance .
" we ca n't take anything for granted .
lyon have a very good team , and they knocked out real madrid .
we 'll have to work hard for 90 minutes , maybe even 120 , " he said .
lyon coach claude puel warned bayern they would be facing a different side in tuesday 's second-leg semi-final .
" bayern feel confident , that 's fair enough ... but we know we are able to overcome any european opponent if we play at our real level , " puel told reporters .
" we 've had to go through difficult moments this season in the champions league and we 've always been able to raise our level each time we had to , " he added. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "

the alpha ventus wind park , germany 's first project of this type built offshore , is located 45 kilometers north of the german island of borkum in the north sea .

alpha ventus is a collaborative effort by german energy giants e.on and ewe and swedish firm vattenfall .
the project was delayed as a result of bad weather and technical difficulties .
according to germany 's office of sea navigation and hydrography , up to 25 off-shore wind farms involving more than 1,650 turbines have been approved for construction in the north sea and baltic sea .

the alpha ventus wind park , germany 's first project of this type built offshore , is located 45 kilometers north of the german island of borkum in the north sea .
data collected from its 12 turbines are expected to help green energy specialists improve technology and construction methods for future off-shore wind farm projects .
" the use of wind energy will play a central role in the energy mix of the future , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who was on site to initiate the wind farm 's turbines .
alpha ventus is a collaborative effort by german energy giants e.on and ewe and swedish firm vattenfall .
the project was delayed as a result of bad weather and technical difficulties .
according to germany 's office of sea navigation and hydrography , up to 25 off-shore wind farms involving more than 1,650 turbines have been approved for construction in the north sea and baltic sea .
a further 60 are in the planning stages. dfm / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the devaluation of the country 's currency at the end of last year has even worsened the food supply for the people . mobile phones are no longer novelty items in pyongyang .
there are around 100,000 mobile phone users in the north korean capital alone .
and on the streets , there are more than just old busses – now there are mercedes , bmws , audis and even porsches .
but these status symbols are only meant for the political elite .
in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .
" i am going to be honest , " jin says . " we made this change because inflation was far too high by the end of last year .
we want to protect our national currency and that is the reason we did it .
and then it turned out some of the experts had made mistakes .
so it was a bit chaotic but we could also see there was a tremendous amount of support for general kim jong il . "

but just beyond the city limits , there are the occasional street merchants with folding tables and a few goods .
trying to woo investors people can buy nearly everything in pyongyang for money , but the prices are sky-high .
the country is in an extremely tight economic situation , which is why its leaders are putting more effort into attracting international investors .
" we have recently emphasized our wish to welcome investors here . "
as general secretary of the german-korean friendship association , jin myong o is especially interested in attracting investors from germany , with which north korea has had diplomatic relations now for almost a decade .
" in these almost 10 years , we have come very far with germany and we would say that our relationship with germany is a good example for other european countries . "
north korean officials are reluctant to talk about politics such as atomic bomb testing or the south korean patrol boat that sank near the border just recently .
but regarding the possible succession to kim jong il , officials say that a special postage stamp honoring his youngest son kim jong un , is being planned .
according to rumors , the 28-year-old is slated to succeed the self-styled great general , who has been experiencing health problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 27.04.2010 food crisis worsened by north korea 's currency reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean farmers work hard without any machines the world food program estimates approximately 1.7 million people will be dependent upon food aid this year in north korea .
the devaluation of the country 's currency at the end of last year has even worsened the food supply for the people . mobile phones are no longer novelty items in pyongyang .
there are around 100,000 mobile phone users in the north korean capital alone .
and on the streets , there are more than just old busses – now there are mercedes , bmws , audis and even porsches .
but these status symbols are only meant for the political elite .
in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .
" i am going to be honest , " jin says . " we made this change because inflation was far too high by the end of last year .
we want to protect our national currency and that is the reason we did it .
and then it turned out some of the experts had made mistakes .
so it was a bit chaotic but we could also see there was a tremendous amount of support for general kim jong il . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il posing for photos with the new chinese ambassador in march apparently the government official who was responsible for the chaos was put to death in march .
still , not much business has returned to tongil market in the north korean capital .
but just beyond the city limits , there are the occasional street merchants with folding tables and a few goods .
trying to woo investors people can buy nearly everything in pyongyang for money , but the prices are sky-high .
the country is in an extremely tight economic situation , which is why its leaders are putting more effort into attracting international investors .
" we have recently emphasized our wish to welcome investors here . "
as general secretary of the german-korean friendship association , jin myong o is especially interested in attracting investors from germany , with which north korea has had diplomatic relations now for almost a decade .
" in these almost 10 years , we have come very far with germany and we would say that our relationship with germany is a good example for other european countries . "
north korean officials are reluctant to talk about politics such as atomic bomb testing or the south korean patrol boat that sank near the border just recently .
but regarding the possible succession to kim jong il , officials say that a special postage stamp honoring his youngest son kim jong un , is being planned .
according to rumors , the 28-year-old is slated to succeed the self-styled great general , who has been experiencing health problems .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .

" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .

the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democrats say the crucifixes in public schools are there to stay the response from the cdu was quick and clear .
" when it comes to religious neutrality , i have a fundamentally different view , " said armin laschet , the integration minister for north rhine-westphalia .
" i 'll say it very clearly : we 're keeping the crosses up in the schools of north rhine-westphalia . "
oezkan later apologized to her colleagues in hanover for the friction her comments had caused .
" ms. oezkan accepts that in lower saxony the crucifix is both welcome and desired in schools , " wulff said .
" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .
" she had to take it back , but i think she was right , " kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany .
integration in action but wulff , kolat , laschet and other cdu members agree that oezkan 's appointment is a good sign for germany .
saarland 's state premier peter mueller , told the newspaper the saarbruecker zeitung that he thought oezkan was a good choice .
" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .
a cabinet shakeup oezkan and three other ministers were appointed last week by wulff in a cabinet reshuffle .
all are expected to be approved by the state parliament where a coalition majority of cdu and the free democrats rules .
oezkan was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants and is a trained lawyer .
she has been the cdu 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg. hf / apn / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal also had its debt rating reduced greece 's outlook was " negative " , a statement from the agency said .
it added that the country 's status could be downgraded further " if the greek government 's ability to implement its fiscal and structural reform program materially weakens in our view . "
that would occur , the agency said , if the greek government was " undermined by domestic political opposition at home or by even weaker economic conditions than we currently assume . "
in an attempt to quell concerns , european union president herman van rompuy said that the negotiations for the aid to greece were going according to plan .
speaking during an official visit in tokyo wednesday morning , van rompuy stressed " there is no question about restructuring " greek debt with aid negotiations under way and " well on track . "
challenges faced by greece greece has been hit by a series of strikes in recent months in protest against the introduction of austerity measures .
" the downgrade results from our updated assessment of the political , economic and budgetary challenges that the greek government faces in its efforts -lrb- to cut debt -rrb- , " standard and poor 's credit analyst marko mrsnik said .
" we believe that the government 's policy options are narrowing because of greece 's weakening economic growth prospects , at a time when pressures for stronger fiscal adjustment measures are rising , " the statement continued .

" given our inability to access the markets , " said greek finance minister george papaconstantinou , " the procedure must be complete , agreed , signed and the release of funds initiated from the imf and our european peers . "
in its downgrade of portugal , standard and poor 's cited concerns about the country 's ability to deal with high debt levels in view of the country 's weak economic outlook .
it cut the rating by two notches to a level that is four notches above junk status . european equities suffered their biggest losses in two months , with the europe-wide ftseurofirst 300 index closing down 3.07 percent. rc / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .
bicycle-friendly copenhagen large cities are ahead of the game particularly when it comes to transport policies .
one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .
for most people in the city , the next bus or train stop is n't more than 300 meters away .
two busses with diesel hybrid engines already ply the roads - eight more are planned .
bildunterschrift : hamburg has one of the best public transport systems " we 're now massively expanding our bicycle transportation network , " said volker duman , a spokesman from the city 's environment agency .
" and hamburg 's regional train network only runs on green energy from hydropower - the first german rail company to do so . "
the city is hoping to achieve an ambitious climate goal - it plans to slash carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
it 's already taken a first step toward that goal .
the city 's per-capita emission rate has already sunk 15 percent compared to 1990 levels .
" it 's a significant success for the city , " according to the eu commission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.04.2010 german troops skeptical of " partnering " with afghan forces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a burned out german military vehicle in afghanistan 's kunduz province the international troops have decided on a new strategy to improve stability in afghanistan .
as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .

under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

several black umbrellas protected parliament speaker volodymyr litvyn from the paper wads and eggs being thrown at him , while other deputies held their noses or put on masks against the smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the speaker hid behind umbrellas as eggs began to fly the deal is the first concrete sign of the more friendly approach to russia under newly-elected president viktor yanukovych .
the agreement , also ratified by russia 's lower house of parliament , extends the russian navy 's lease at the port of sevastopol for 25 years after the current lease expires in 2017 .
the deal was signed by yanukovych and russian president dmitry medvedev last week and has been heavily criticized by supporters of yanukovych 's pro-western predecessor viktor yushchenko .
outside the parliament building , they shouted " death to traitors ! " and " crimea is ours . "
russia willing to pay big money base lease in exchange for the lease extension , russia is giving ukraine a 30 percent discount on russian natural gas imports , a pledge worth some 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- over 10 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich promised to restore relations with russia earlier on tuesday , russian prime minister vladimir putin held talks with ukrainian leaders in kiev at which he offered an unprecedented nuclear cooperation deal .
he admitted to reporters that the gas deal had hurt the russian budget .
" it 's going to be a burden , of course .
and a major one , " he said .
" the amount that this has cost us is really something else .
for this kind of money i could have eaten yanukovych and your prime minister together . "
russia 's supply of natural gas to ukraine has been cut three times in recent years over disagreements on payments from ukraine .
european union officials stepped in during the most recent standoff in 2009 when moscow 's decision to halt gas flowing through ukrainian pipes led to shortages in the eu. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .
so we 're grateful that the americans are helping us to compensate for this . " it is planned that the us soldiers will also train the local police and enable them to hold an area after the anti-insurgency operation is over .
the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .
so we 're grateful that the americans are helping us to compensate for this . " it is planned that the us soldiers will also train the local police and enable them to hold an area after the anti-insurgency operation is over .
the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .
bicycle-friendly copenhagen large cities are ahead of the game particularly when it comes to transport policies .
one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .
for most people in the city , the next bus or train stop is n't more than 300 meters away .
two busses with diesel hybrid engines already ply the roads - eight more are planned .
bildunterschrift : hamburg has one of the best public transport systems " we 're now massively expanding our bicycle transportation network , " said volker duman , a spokesman from the city 's environment agency .
" and hamburg 's regional train network only runs on green energy from hydropower - the first german rail company to do so . "
the city is hoping to achieve an ambitious climate goal - it plans to slash carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
it 's already taken a first step toward that goal .
the city 's per-capita emission rate has already sunk 15 percent compared to 1990 levels .
" it 's a significant success for the city , " according to the eu commission .

in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .

other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .

the alpha ventus wind park , germany 's first project of this type built offshore , is located 45 kilometers north of the german island of borkum in the north sea .
data collected from its 12 turbines are expected to help green energy specialists improve technology and construction methods for future off-shore wind farm projects .
" the use of wind energy will play a central role in the energy mix of the future , " said environment minister norbert roettgen , who was on site to initiate the wind farm 's turbines .
alpha ventus is a collaborative effort by german energy giants e.on and ewe and swedish firm vattenfall .
the project was delayed as a result of bad weather and technical difficulties .
according to germany 's office of sea navigation and hydrography , up to 25 off-shore wind farms involving more than 1,650 turbines have been approved for construction in the north sea and baltic sea .
a further 60 are in the planning stages. dfm / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .
bicycle-friendly copenhagen large cities are ahead of the game particularly when it comes to transport policies .
one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .
for most people in the city , the next bus or train stop is n't more than 300 meters away .
two busses with diesel hybrid engines already ply the roads - eight more are planned .
bildunterschrift : hamburg has one of the best public transport systems " we 're now massively expanding our bicycle transportation network , " said volker duman , a spokesman from the city 's environment agency .
" and hamburg 's regional train network only runs on green energy from hydropower - the first german rail company to do so . "
the city is hoping to achieve an ambitious climate goal - it plans to slash carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
it 's already taken a first step toward that goal .
the city 's per-capita emission rate has already sunk 15 percent compared to 1990 levels .
" it 's a significant success for the city , " according to the eu commission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 27.04.2010 deutsche bahn heads down transparency track großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all-aboard for compliance : deutsche bahn moves ahead europe 's biggest railway company , deutsche bahn , has called in auditors to investigate bribery allegations at its international consulting arm .
compliance experts say the move is part of a positive management trend . under its new management team , deutsche bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market . the state-owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , deutsche bahn international , by hiring professional services group kpmg to conduct a special audit .
new evidence uncovered the unit , which offers consultancy services worldwide to governments and other bodies planning and building railways , has been under investigation since 2005 for allegedly bribing officials in algeria , greece and rwanda .
but new evidence uncovered by prosecutors in frankfurt and presented to deutsche bahn last week prompted a decision for " swift action , " company spokesman jens-oliver voss told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn spied on staff in a scandal that forced ceo mehdorn to resign voss said deutsche bahn has a fundamental interest in uncovering the truth about the transactions , noting that the company itself brought details of irregularities to the attention of prosecutors last year .
its new senior management team , he added , " has given compliance the highest possible priority . "
in march 2009 , hartmut mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of deutsche bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
his successor ruediger grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .
besides the new board position , grube has hired additional compliance staff and introduced training courses to " modernize compliance " and ensure that business practices across the company meet all legal requirements , according to peter von blomberg with transparency international , an organization that fights global corruption .
" over the past 12 months , deutsche bahn has done very much in the area of compliance , " he told deutsche welle .
" but it still needs to implement some steps . "
siemens scandal fallout numerous german companies with large international operations have given compliance and anti-corruption initiatives greater focus following the siemens scandal over bribes for international engineering contracts , according to von blomberg .
" this scandal created a lot of attention – negative attention – and resulted in numerous german companies taking a tougher stance on fighting corruption , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens scandal has prompted tough anti-corruption action deutsche bahn has ambitious international expansion plans .
on thursday , the railway company agreed to buy british train and bus operator arriva in a strategic push to expand in europe 's increasingly open rail markets .
and the company appears to be aware that as it grows abroad , so , too , do the opportunities for corruption .
earlier last week , deutsche bahn joined siemens , daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in russia .
both siemens and daimler have also been involved in large-scale bribery cases in russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .

fellow dutchman mark van bommel was also optimistic about his team 's chances of reaching the final .

keeping a clean sheet would be enough to see bayern through to the final , the team said on its website , but van gaal is looking for an away goal : “ we don ’ t have the team to play for a clean sheet .
we ’ ve not tried that all season , and we won ’ t try it tomorrow . ”
" when i was a coach in the netherlands and my team had to play against a german one , i used to tell my players that they had to be ready to play until the very end of the game .

" we ca n't take anything for granted .
lyon have a very good team , and they knocked out real madrid .
we 'll have to work hard for 90 minutes , maybe even 120 , " he said .
lyon coach claude puel warned bayern they would be facing a different side in tuesday 's second-leg semi-final .
" bayern feel confident , that 's fair enough ... but we know we are able to overcome any european opponent if we play at our real level , " puel told reporters .
" we 've had to go through difficult moments this season in the champions league and we 've always been able to raise our level each time we had to , " he added. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .
bicycle-friendly copenhagen large cities are ahead of the game particularly when it comes to transport policies .
one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .
for most people in the city , the next bus or train stop is n't more than 300 meters away .

bayern will also be without franck ribery , who was sent off in the first leg match at the allianz arena in munich .

fellow dutchman mark van bommel was also optimistic about his team 's chances of reaching the final .
" we have often conceded goals in away games this season but that 's not a problem because even if we concede six goals tomorrow and we score five , we 're through , " the bayern captain said .
keeping a clean sheet would be enough to see bayern through to the final , the team said on its website , but van gaal is looking for an away goal : “ we don ’ t have the team to play for a clean sheet .
we ’ ve not tried that all season , and we won ’ t try it tomorrow . ”
" when i was a coach in the netherlands and my team had to play against a german one , i used to tell my players that they had to be ready to play until the very end of the game .

we 'll need all the determination we have , ” said bastian schweinsteiger .
goalkeeper jörg butt called on the team to produce a top performance .
" we ca n't take anything for granted .
lyon have a very good team , and they knocked out real madrid .
we 'll have to work hard for 90 minutes , maybe even 120 , " he said .
lyon coach claude puel warned bayern they would be facing a different side in tuesday 's second-leg semi-final .
" bayern feel confident , that 's fair enough ... but we know we are able to overcome any european opponent if we play at our real level , " puel told reporters .
" we 've had to go through difficult moments this season in the champions league and we 've always been able to raise our level each time we had to , " he added. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .

" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .
" she had to take it back , but i think she was right , " kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany .
integration in action but wulff , kolat , laschet and other cdu members agree that oezkan 's appointment is a good sign for germany .

" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .

van gaal told a news conference he did not know if injured defenders martin demichelis , daniel van buyten and diego contento would recover in time for tuesday 's crunch match .
" i 've come here with 17 players and i can only field 11 so if i miss the three others , i 'll still have 14 available players , " van gaal said .
bayern will also be without franck ribery , who was sent off in the first leg match at the allianz arena in munich .

i 've never told my players to play like that since the beginning of the season and i wo n't start now , " van gaalsaid .
fellow dutchman mark van bommel was also optimistic about his team 's chances of reaching the final .
" we have often conceded goals in away games this season but that 's not a problem because even if we concede six goals tomorrow and we score five , we 're through , " the bayern captain said .
keeping a clean sheet would be enough to see bayern through to the final , the team said on its website , but van gaal is looking for an away goal : “ we don ’ t have the team to play for a clean sheet .
we ’ ve not tried that all season , and we won ’ t try it tomorrow . ”
" when i was a coach in the netherlands and my team had to play against a german one , i used to tell my players that they had to be ready to play until the very end of the game .
bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's franck ribery was sent off in the first leg french underdogs despite the french side 's status as underdogs , bayern players have a lot of lot of respect for lyon after they gained a shock second-leg draw against real madrid saw them progress to the quarter-finals , where they eased past bordeaux .
" 1-0 is obviously helpful , but it 's not over yet .
we 'll need all the determination we have , ” said bastian schweinsteiger .
goalkeeper jörg butt called on the team to produce a top performance .
" we ca n't take anything for granted .
lyon have a very good team , and they knocked out real madrid .
we 'll have to work hard for 90 minutes , maybe even 120 , " he said .
lyon coach claude puel warned bayern they would be facing a different side in tuesday 's second-leg semi-final .
" bayern feel confident , that 's fair enough ... but we know we are able to overcome any european opponent if we play at our real level , " puel told reporters .
" we 've had to go through difficult moments this season in the champions league and we 've always been able to raise our level each time we had to , " he added. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .
the americans are going to support the germans in the north by moving about 4,500 soldiers there as well , plus up to 70 helicopters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german general bruno kasdorf is chief of staff at isaf in kabul isaf chief of staff general kasdorf appreciates this .
" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .
so we 're grateful that the americans are helping us to compensate for this . " it is planned that the us soldiers will also train the local police and enable them to hold an area after the anti-insurgency operation is over .
the isaf leadership is eager to see first successes of the " partnering " concept as soon as possible .
after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .

cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .

that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .
the united nations estimates that by 2030 , that figure will rise to 60 percent , or five billion people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some mega-cities such as delhi struggle to combat traffic congestion the growing urban population causes many problems : high energy consumption , worsening traffic and growing demand for water .
since 2006 , a group called large cities climate leadership group -lrb- c40 -rrb- - an alliance of 40 metropolises - has been grappling with the problems .
the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .
bicycle-friendly copenhagen large cities are ahead of the game particularly when it comes to transport policies .
one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .
for most people in the city , the next bus or train stop is n't more than 300 meters away .
two busses with diesel hybrid engines already ply the roads - eight more are planned .
bildunterschrift : hamburg has one of the best public transport systems " we 're now massively expanding our bicycle transportation network , " said volker duman , a spokesman from the city 's environment agency .
" and hamburg 's regional train network only runs on green energy from hydropower - the first german rail company to do so . "
the city is hoping to achieve an ambitious climate goal - it plans to slash carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
it 's already taken a first step toward that goal .
the city 's per-capita emission rate has already sunk 15 percent compared to 1990 levels .
" it 's a significant success for the city , " according to the eu commission .

compliance experts say the move is part of a positive management trend . under its new management team , deutsche bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market . the state-owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , deutsche bahn international , by hiring professional services group kpmg to conduct a special audit .
new evidence uncovered the unit , which offers consultancy services worldwide to governments and other bodies planning and building railways , has been under investigation since 2005 for allegedly bribing officials in algeria , greece and rwanda .

its new senior management team , he added , " has given compliance the highest possible priority . "
in march 2009 , hartmut mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of deutsche bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
his successor ruediger grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .
besides the new board position , grube has hired additional compliance staff and introduced training courses to " modernize compliance " and ensure that business practices across the company meet all legal requirements , according to peter von blomberg with transparency international , an organization that fights global corruption .

and the company appears to be aware that as it grows abroad , so , too , do the opportunities for corruption .
earlier last week , deutsche bahn joined siemens , daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in russia .
both siemens and daimler have also been involved in large-scale bribery cases in russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

compliance experts say the move is part of a positive management trend . under its new management team , deutsche bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market . the state-owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , deutsche bahn international , by hiring professional services group kpmg to conduct a special audit .
new evidence uncovered the unit , which offers consultancy services worldwide to governments and other bodies planning and building railways , has been under investigation since 2005 for allegedly bribing officials in algeria , greece and rwanda .

its new senior management team , he added , " has given compliance the highest possible priority . "
in march 2009 , hartmut mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of deutsche bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
his successor ruediger grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .
besides the new board position , grube has hired additional compliance staff and introduced training courses to " modernize compliance " and ensure that business practices across the company meet all legal requirements , according to peter von blomberg with transparency international , an organization that fights global corruption .
" over the past 12 months , deutsche bahn has done very much in the area of compliance , " he told deutsche welle .
" but it still needs to implement some steps . "
siemens scandal fallout numerous german companies with large international operations have given compliance and anti-corruption initiatives greater focus following the siemens scandal over bribes for international engineering contracts , according to von blomberg .

earlier last week , deutsche bahn joined siemens , daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in russia .
both siemens and daimler have also been involved in large-scale bribery cases in russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .

and eu defense minister agreed to meet regularly to discuss how to react more swiftly to conflicts or catastrophes . nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on monday urged members countries to pool their resources if the alliance was to successfully deal with threats of the 21st century .
the key to tackling the challenges of modern warfare was working together to build weapons and systems that are compatible and therefore cheaper in the long run , the nato chief told the belgian high institute for defense in brussels .
" we should work harder to find solutions to fundamental problems between the eu and nato , " he said .
in the past , eu defense ministers met on average just once every six months on the sidelines of eu foreign minister meetings .
spainish defense minister carme chacon , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said that there was general agreement on meeting more frequently , as stipulated in the lisbon treaty .
faced with a crippling economic recession , national governments have been under intense pressure to cut back on public expenditure and implement military spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : costing 100 million euros each the eurofighter is the biggest european arms project " i understand that there are strong national interests at work here , and in the current economic climate , there is a real danger of protectionism , " nato chief rasmussen said .
" but we must resist these temptations - purely national thinking is no longer affordable . " financial pool rasmussen said nato allies should give up on expensive national arms programs if it would make more economic sense to set up shared ones .
as part of a new strategy to abandon cold war structures and standardize costs , he also proposed setting up a joint financial pool to finance future military missions .
the failure to standardize equipment , from helicopters to combat vehicles was also adding to costs and putting lives at risk , rasmussen added .
" we must overhaul our defense industrial markets - particularly here in europe - to reduce the fragmentation and make them stronger , " he said .
" it makes no sense for europe to have 16 naval shipyards and 12 separate manufacturers of armored vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato members are protective of their national defence industries afghanistan policing the nato secretary general outlined concrete measures that included sharing tasks in afghanistan between the european union and the military alliance in training police .
rasmussen said he had proposed that the eu concentrate on the civilian aspects of policing in afghanistan like criminal investigation or justice reforms and for nato to focus on the more challenging aspects of the isaf mission .
costly lessons at a meeting of european defense ministers in luxembourg , eda chief alexander weis called for greater cooperation between eu member states in the development of unmanned drones .
weis , who used to be deputy national armanents director in the german ministry of defense , recalled how 25 years ago , six eu countries collaborated in the development of three fighter jets . he told the ministers that the development of eurofighter , rafale and viggen had cost around 25 billion euros .
the european union could have saved a lot of money and were now in a similar situation with the drones .
the european defense agency was established by the council of minister in 2004 to support the member states and the council in their effort to improve european defense capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the european security and defense policy. nrt / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern may be on course for another bundesliga title this season , but only managed a draw against lowly borussia monchengladbach on saturday . however , a similar result on tuesday would book their place in the champions league final on may 22 in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach van gaal says bayern is strong-willed " we are not the kind of team whose aim is just to avoid conceding goals when we enter the field .
i 've never told my players to play like that since the beginning of the season and i wo n't start now , " van gaalsaid .
fellow dutchman mark van bommel was also optimistic about his team 's chances of reaching the final .
" we have often conceded goals in away games this season but that 's not a problem because even if we concede six goals tomorrow and we score five , we 're through , " the bayern captain said .
keeping a clean sheet would be enough to see bayern through to the final , the team said on its website , but van gaal is looking for an away goal : “ we don ’ t have the team to play for a clean sheet .
we ’ ve not tried that all season , and we won ’ t try it tomorrow . ”
" when i was a coach in the netherlands and my team had to play against a german one , i used to tell my players that they had to be ready to play until the very end of the game .
bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's franck ribery was sent off in the first leg french underdogs despite the french side 's status as underdogs , bayern players have a lot of lot of respect for lyon after they gained a shock second-leg draw against real madrid saw them progress to the quarter-finals , where they eased past bordeaux .
" 1-0 is obviously helpful , but it 's not over yet .
we 'll need all the determination we have , ” said bastian schweinsteiger .
goalkeeper jörg butt called on the team to produce a top performance .
" we ca n't take anything for granted .
lyon have a very good team , and they knocked out real madrid .
we 'll have to work hard for 90 minutes , maybe even 120 , " he said .
lyon coach claude puel warned bayern they would be facing a different side in tuesday 's second-leg semi-final .
" bayern feel confident , that 's fair enough ... but we know we are able to overcome any european opponent if we play at our real level , " puel told reporters .
" we 've had to go through difficult moments this season in the champions league and we 've always been able to raise our level each time we had to , " he added. nrt / reuters / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .

however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .

speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .

" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .

" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .
a cabinet shakeup oezkan and three other ministers were appointed last week by wulff in a cabinet reshuffle .

several black umbrellas protected parliament speaker volodymyr litvyn from the paper wads and eggs being thrown at him , while other deputies held their noses or put on masks against the smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the speaker hid behind umbrellas as eggs began to fly the deal is the first concrete sign of the more friendly approach to russia under newly-elected president viktor yanukovych .
the agreement , also ratified by russia 's lower house of parliament , extends the russian navy 's lease at the port of sevastopol for 25 years after the current lease expires in 2017 .
the deal was signed by yanukovych and russian president dmitry medvedev last week and has been heavily criticized by supporters of yanukovych 's pro-western predecessor viktor yushchenko .
outside the parliament building , they shouted " death to traitors ! " and " crimea is ours . "
russia willing to pay big money base lease in exchange for the lease extension , russia is giving ukraine a 30 percent discount on russian natural gas imports , a pledge worth some 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 40 billion -rrb- over 10 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovich promised to restore relations with russia earlier on tuesday , russian prime minister vladimir putin held talks with ukrainian leaders in kiev at which he offered an unprecedented nuclear cooperation deal .
he admitted to reporters that the gas deal had hurt the russian budget .
" it 's going to be a burden , of course .
and a major one , " he said .
" the amount that this has cost us is really something else .
for this kind of money i could have eaten yanukovych and your prime minister together . "
russia 's supply of natural gas to ukraine has been cut three times in recent years over disagreements on payments from ukraine .
european union officials stepped in during the most recent standoff in 2009 when moscow 's decision to halt gas flowing through ukrainian pipes led to shortages in the eu. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

several black umbrellas protected parliament speaker volodymyr litvyn from the paper wads and eggs being thrown at him , while other deputies held their noses or put on masks against the smoke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the speaker hid behind umbrellas as eggs began to fly the deal is the first concrete sign of the more friendly approach to russia under newly-elected president viktor yanukovych .
the agreement , also ratified by russia 's lower house of parliament , extends the russian navy 's lease at the port of sevastopol for 25 years after the current lease expires in 2017 .
the deal was signed by yanukovych and russian president dmitry medvedev last week and has been heavily criticized by supporters of yanukovych 's pro-western predecessor viktor yushchenko .

the devaluation of the country 's currency at the end of last year has even worsened the food supply for the people . mobile phones are no longer novelty items in pyongyang .
there are around 100,000 mobile phone users in the north korean capital alone .
and on the streets , there are more than just old busses – now there are mercedes , bmws , audis and even porsches .
but these status symbols are only meant for the political elite .
in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .
" i am going to be honest , " jin says . " we made this change because inflation was far too high by the end of last year .

as general secretary of the german-korean friendship association , jin myong o is especially interested in attracting investors from germany , with which north korea has had diplomatic relations now for almost a decade .
" in these almost 10 years , we have come very far with germany and we would say that our relationship with germany is a good example for other european countries . "
north korean officials are reluctant to talk about politics such as atomic bomb testing or the south korean patrol boat that sank near the border just recently .
but regarding the possible succession to kim jong il , officials say that a special postage stamp honoring his youngest son kim jong un , is being planned .
according to rumors , the 28-year-old is slated to succeed the self-styled great general , who has been experiencing health problems .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "

one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .

after all , the withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan is scheduled to begin in 2011 .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .

one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .

the agreement ends decades of negotiation over the inhospitable area believed to be rich in oil and gas deposits . the leaders of russia and norway voiced satisfaction over a compromise that ends 40 years of dispute over their maritime frontiers .
" this solution is about more than a border line under the ocean .
it is about developing good neighborly relations , " norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said at a joint press with russian president dmitry medvedev in oslo .
" it will unite much more than divide , and it will become a bridge to cooperation , " he added .
disputes over the sea began in 1970 between norway and the soviet union , subsequently continuing with russia .
the 176,000 square kilometre -lrb- 67,950 square mile -rrb- zone lies off their arctic coastlines .
" i am glad that we have turned this page , " medvedev told the press conference .
" if problems are not solved definitively , then there is friction which presents a strain , " he said .
riches beneath the surface projects are already under way to exploit natural resources on both sides of the frontier , involving russian energy giant gazprom and the norwegian fuel supplier statoil .
canada , denmark , norway , russia and the united states have yet to agree on how to share the wider arctic seabed , which is estimated by the us geological survey to hold 90 billion barrels of oil as well as 30 percent of the world 's undiscovered gas resources .
the need to find a resolution has increased as new technology and global warming make the deposits more accessible. rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de russia and the great natural gas balancing act russia controls the world 's largest gas reserves , but a combination of factors , including power production , climate change and logistics , are keeping it from reaping the greatest benefits .
-lrb- 09.08.2009 -rrb- russian security plan prompts fears over future energy wars the eu 's diplomatic efforts in the russia-ukraine crisis may have focused on restoring the flow of gas but could it also have been trying to avoid a more ominous escalation as predicted by a russian security document ? -lrb- 14.01.2009 -rrb- in russian arctic , global warming threatens traditional way of life russian scientists have doubts over whether global warming is here to stay and whether it 's man made .

the lending status for portugal was also downgraded . stocks fell in europe and on wall street after credit rating agency standard and poor 's cut its credit rating on greece to junk status on tuesday .
the news means that lending to the country is considered to be speculative rather than an investment .
the agency lowered both greece 's long-term and short-term debt ratings .
the euro fell by 1 percent against the dollar on tuesday as the ratings agency also slashed its credit ratings for portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal also had its debt rating reduced greece 's outlook was " negative " , a statement from the agency said .
it added that the country 's status could be downgraded further " if the greek government 's ability to implement its fiscal and structural reform program materially weakens in our view . "
that would occur , the agency said , if the greek government was " undermined by domestic political opposition at home or by even weaker economic conditions than we currently assume . "
in an attempt to quell concerns , european union president herman van rompuy said that the negotiations for the aid to greece were going according to plan .
speaking during an official visit in tokyo wednesday morning , van rompuy stressed " there is no question about restructuring " greek debt with aid negotiations under way and " well on track . "
challenges faced by greece greece has been hit by a series of strikes in recent months in protest against the introduction of austerity measures .
" the downgrade results from our updated assessment of the political , economic and budgetary challenges that the greek government faces in its efforts -lrb- to cut debt -rrb- , " standard and poor 's credit analyst marko mrsnik said .
" we believe that the government 's policy options are narrowing because of greece 's weakening economic growth prospects , at a time when pressures for stronger fiscal adjustment measures are rising , " the statement continued .
package needed to pay debt last week , greece asked the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for loans worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 59.5 billion -rrb- this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has been hit by a series of strikes in recent months following the downgrade , greece called for european governments to act quickly to activate a multi-billion-euro bailout package for the country . it said that it would no longer be possible raise funds on international markets and that it needed the money to pay back debt due in three weeks .
" given our inability to access the markets , " said greek finance minister george papaconstantinou , " the procedure must be complete , agreed , signed and the release of funds initiated from the imf and our european peers . "
in its downgrade of portugal , standard and poor 's cited concerns about the country 's ability to deal with high debt levels in view of the country 's weak economic outlook .
it cut the rating by two notches to a level that is four notches above junk status . european equities suffered their biggest losses in two months , with the europe-wide ftseurofirst 300 index closing down 3.07 percent. rc / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the downgrade results from our updated assessment of the political , economic and budgetary challenges that the greek government faces in its efforts -lrb- to cut debt -rrb- , " standard and poor 's credit analyst marko mrsnik said .
" we believe that the government 's policy options are narrowing because of greece 's weakening economic growth prospects , at a time when pressures for stronger fiscal adjustment measures are rising , " the statement continued .

" given our inability to access the markets , " said greek finance minister george papaconstantinou , " the procedure must be complete , agreed , signed and the release of funds initiated from the imf and our european peers . "
in its downgrade of portugal , standard and poor 's cited concerns about the country 's ability to deal with high debt levels in view of the country 's weak economic outlook .
it cut the rating by two notches to a level that is four notches above junk status . european equities suffered their biggest losses in two months , with the europe-wide ftseurofirst 300 index closing down 3.07 percent. rc / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 27.04.2010 copyright violators could lose internet access under new uk bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk users who illegally download music and films face a tougher new law the british house of commons has passed a new bill to deal with repeat digital copyright violators .
it would reduce their bandwidth or even deny them web access .
british users and isps have begun protesting the act . britain 's digital economy bill has sparked protest and debate since its passage on april 8 .
the legislation introduces a host of new measures for the digital realm including updated videogame classifications , modified licensing procedures for broadcasters and new copyright regulations .
the bill 's provisions on downloads of copyrighted material have drawn the most public attention .
the digital economy bill requires internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- to track users downloading copyrighted files and notify them of their infringement .
if users do not stop illegally downloading files after three notifications , the bill authorizes the secretary of state to impose limits on the violators ' bandwidth or to cut off their internet access entirely .
the government intends the new law to make britain more attractive to artists and others affected by copyright infringement .
fergal sharkey , who heads the group uk music , supports the bill .
" about 94 percent of song writers and composers get less than five thousand pounds a year , and 80 percent of musicians make less than fifteen thousands pounds a year .
they want a normal life , " sharkey said .
" if we want to enjoy the quality of music we have , at some point we have to start paying for it . "
false accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british parliament passed the legislation just before may 's general elections however , opponents have raised two major objections to the digital economy bill .
they view its punishments as too harsh , and , moreover , they argue that many people will be falsely accused under the new law .
for instance , those who are tech-savvy enough to be heavily involved in file sharing may just hide their activities by using other people 's internet connections , said mark mclaren of the consumer watchdog group which .
the bill includes measures that would " only identify the internet connection and provider but not identify the file sharer , " said mclaren .
british isp talk agrees and has stated it will refuse to disconnect any user 's internet service on the basis of the new act .
critics also claim the digital economy bill does not adequately address the complicated issues that go beyond file sharers hacking into other users ' connections to download .
opponents like florian leppla point to situations including on-campus computer networks or wireless hubs in libraries and cafes , where it becomes difficult to identify who downloaded what .
" the threat is that a whole library is disconnected , " said leppla of the open rights group , which opposes the legislation .
" no one can believe it , but there is no exception for libraries or universities .
this means they ca n't do their jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open rights group wants its visitors to vote against the bill 's supporters " clear and effective " appeals the bill 's authors hoped to address objections like these by specifically including what they deem a " clear and effective " appeals procedure in the legislation .
the appeals body would be independent of the isps and rights holders .
the bill 's language also makes it clear that persistent copyright violators are the target of the new law .
but leppla still worries about the ambiguity of several elements included in the digital economy .
" the period of disconnection is not defined .
whether it 's a day a week , or a year is not clear , and that 's a draconian measure for downloading a couple of songs whose market value would be ten or twenty pounds , " he said .
as for the appeals procedure , it may be tested soon .
around 200 citizens have contacted which after receiving copyright infringement letters directly from copyright holders that they say were in error .
although copyright holders will now be encouraged to work within the new legal framework , the bill does not prevent them from continuing to take private action against suspected downloaders and file sharers .

and eu defense minister agreed to meet regularly to discuss how to react more swiftly to conflicts or catastrophes . nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on monday urged members countries to pool their resources if the alliance was to successfully deal with threats of the 21st century .
the key to tackling the challenges of modern warfare was working together to build weapons and systems that are compatible and therefore cheaper in the long run , the nato chief told the belgian high institute for defense in brussels .
" we should work harder to find solutions to fundamental problems between the eu and nato , " he said .
in the past , eu defense ministers met on average just once every six months on the sidelines of eu foreign minister meetings .
spainish defense minister carme chacon , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said that there was general agreement on meeting more frequently , as stipulated in the lisbon treaty .
faced with a crippling economic recession , national governments have been under intense pressure to cut back on public expenditure and implement military spending cuts .
bildunterschrift : costing 100 million euros each the eurofighter is the biggest european arms project " i understand that there are strong national interests at work here , and in the current economic climate , there is a real danger of protectionism , " nato chief rasmussen said .
" but we must resist these temptations - purely national thinking is no longer affordable . " financial pool rasmussen said nato allies should give up on expensive national arms programs if it would make more economic sense to set up shared ones .
as part of a new strategy to abandon cold war structures and standardize costs , he also proposed setting up a joint financial pool to finance future military missions .
the failure to standardize equipment , from helicopters to combat vehicles was also adding to costs and putting lives at risk , rasmussen added .
" we must overhaul our defense industrial markets - particularly here in europe - to reduce the fragmentation and make them stronger , " he said .
" it makes no sense for europe to have 16 naval shipyards and 12 separate manufacturers of armored vehicles . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato members are protective of their national defence industries afghanistan policing the nato secretary general outlined concrete measures that included sharing tasks in afghanistan between the european union and the military alliance in training police .
rasmussen said he had proposed that the eu concentrate on the civilian aspects of policing in afghanistan like criminal investigation or justice reforms and for nato to focus on the more challenging aspects of the isaf mission .
costly lessons at a meeting of european defense ministers in luxembourg , eda chief alexander weis called for greater cooperation between eu member states in the development of unmanned drones .
weis , who used to be deputy national armanents director in the german ministry of defense , recalled how 25 years ago , six eu countries collaborated in the development of three fighter jets . he told the ministers that the development of eurofighter , rafale and viggen had cost around 25 billion euros .
the european union could have saved a lot of money and were now in a similar situation with the drones .
the european defense agency was established by the council of minister in 2004 to support the member states and the council in their effort to improve european defense capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the european security and defense policy. nrt / dpa / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

injury-hit bayern travel to lyon with a 1-0 advantage for the second leg of the champions league semi-final on tuesday hoping to book a place in the final of europe 's most prestigious tournament . bayern munich coach louis van gaal played down the injury problems facing his team ahead of tuesday 's champions league semi-final second leg in lyon .
van gaal told a news conference he did not know if injured defenders martin demichelis , daniel van buyten and diego contento would recover in time for tuesday 's crunch match .
" i 've come here with 17 players and i can only field 11 so if i miss the three others , i 'll still have 14 available players , " van gaal said .
bayern will also be without franck ribery , who was sent off in the first leg match at the allianz arena in munich .
bayern may be on course for another bundesliga title this season , but only managed a draw against lowly borussia monchengladbach on saturday . however , a similar result on tuesday would book their place in the champions league final on may 22 in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach van gaal says bayern is strong-willed " we are not the kind of team whose aim is just to avoid conceding goals when we enter the field .
i 've never told my players to play like that since the beginning of the season and i wo n't start now , " van gaalsaid .
fellow dutchman mark van bommel was also optimistic about his team 's chances of reaching the final .
" we have often conceded goals in away games this season but that 's not a problem because even if we concede six goals tomorrow and we score five , we 're through , " the bayern captain said .
keeping a clean sheet would be enough to see bayern through to the final , the team said on its website , but van gaal is looking for an away goal : “ we don ’ t have the team to play for a clean sheet .
we ’ ve not tried that all season , and we won ’ t try it tomorrow . ”
" when i was a coach in the netherlands and my team had to play against a german one , i used to tell my players that they had to be ready to play until the very end of the game .
bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's franck ribery was sent off in the first leg french underdogs despite the french side 's status as underdogs , bayern players have a lot of lot of respect for lyon after they gained a shock second-leg draw against real madrid saw them progress to the quarter-finals , where they eased past bordeaux .
" 1-0 is obviously helpful , but it 's not over yet .
we 'll need all the determination we have , ” said bastian schweinsteiger .
goalkeeper jörg butt called on the team to produce a top performance .
" we ca n't take anything for granted .
lyon have a very good team , and they knocked out real madrid .
we 'll have to work hard for 90 minutes , maybe even 120 , " he said .

the devaluation of the country 's currency at the end of last year has even worsened the food supply for the people . mobile phones are no longer novelty items in pyongyang .
there are around 100,000 mobile phone users in the north korean capital alone .
and on the streets , there are more than just old busses – now there are mercedes , bmws , audis and even porsches .
but these status symbols are only meant for the political elite .
in the countryside , farmers are working extremely hard without machines after a long winter .
" we can already see that the harvest this year will probably be less than last year ’ s " , says johan van der kamp , director of the german famine relief organization , welthungerhilfe , in north korea .
" on top of that , the food supplies have worsened since the currency reform . "
officials admit mistakes with currency reform with regard to the currency devaluation at the end of last year , the regime has now started admitting mistakes .
the general secretary of the german-korean friendship association in pyongyang , jin myong o , does not see any reason to doubt the north korean leader , though .
" i am going to be honest , " jin says . " we made this change because inflation was far too high by the end of last year .
we want to protect our national currency and that is the reason we did it .
and then it turned out some of the experts had made mistakes .
so it was a bit chaotic but we could also see there was a tremendous amount of support for general kim jong il . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il posing for photos with the new chinese ambassador in march apparently the government official who was responsible for the chaos was put to death in march .
still , not much business has returned to tongil market in the north korean capital .
but just beyond the city limits , there are the occasional street merchants with folding tables and a few goods .
trying to woo investors people can buy nearly everything in pyongyang for money , but the prices are sky-high .

the lending status for portugal was also downgraded . stocks fell in europe and on wall street after credit rating agency standard and poor 's cut its credit rating on greece to junk status on tuesday .
the news means that lending to the country is considered to be speculative rather than an investment .
the agency lowered both greece 's long-term and short-term debt ratings .
the euro fell by 1 percent against the dollar on tuesday as the ratings agency also slashed its credit ratings for portugal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal also had its debt rating reduced greece 's outlook was " negative " , a statement from the agency said .
it added that the country 's status could be downgraded further " if the greek government 's ability to implement its fiscal and structural reform program materially weakens in our view . "
that would occur , the agency said , if the greek government was " undermined by domestic political opposition at home or by even weaker economic conditions than we currently assume . "
in an attempt to quell concerns , european union president herman van rompuy said that the negotiations for the aid to greece were going according to plan .
speaking during an official visit in tokyo wednesday morning , van rompuy stressed " there is no question about restructuring " greek debt with aid negotiations under way and " well on track . "
challenges faced by greece greece has been hit by a series of strikes in recent months in protest against the introduction of austerity measures .
" the downgrade results from our updated assessment of the political , economic and budgetary challenges that the greek government faces in its efforts -lrb- to cut debt -rrb- , " standard and poor 's credit analyst marko mrsnik said .
" we believe that the government 's policy options are narrowing because of greece 's weakening economic growth prospects , at a time when pressures for stronger fiscal adjustment measures are rising , " the statement continued .
package needed to pay debt last week , greece asked the european union and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for loans worth up to 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 59.5 billion -rrb- this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has been hit by a series of strikes in recent months following the downgrade , greece called for european governments to act quickly to activate a multi-billion-euro bailout package for the country . it said that it would no longer be possible raise funds on international markets and that it needed the money to pay back debt due in three weeks .
" given our inability to access the markets , " said greek finance minister george papaconstantinou , " the procedure must be complete , agreed , signed and the release of funds initiated from the imf and our european peers . "
in its downgrade of portugal , standard and poor 's cited concerns about the country 's ability to deal with high debt levels in view of the country 's weak economic outlook .
it cut the rating by two notches to a level that is four notches above junk status . european equities suffered their biggest losses in two months , with the europe-wide ftseurofirst 300 index closing down 3.07 percent. rc / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .
lieutenant colonel matthias lau , deputy commander of the german military camp in kunduz , says : " no one has claimed that this is easy .
cooperating in an alliance , and particularly with afghan security forces , is always a challenge . "
different approaches around kunduz , german and afghan soldiers are supposed to clear out the insurgents ' havens .
but there are certain reservations in the german isaf contingent .
colonel michael matz has come to know the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- well in his six months as commander of the quick reaction force in northern afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg meets afghan army officials in kabul " their equipment is getting better , " says matz .
" but as far as the planning of operations is concerned , there are still some differences .
while we rely on a thorough analysis of the situation when making a decision , the afghans tend to decide on the basis of a gut feeling or because of pressure from their higher-ups . "
other german soldiers add to the list of what they see as the afghans ' shortcomings : unreliability , drug abuse , a lack of discipline and military know-how and a disregard for the protection of the population .
one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "
the modus operandi of the afghan troops is not without risks for their isaf partners .
it is unclear how they should behave when afghan soldiers commit atrocities against insurgents or civilians , or when they loot villages .
expecting us support the bundeswehr plans to contribute 1,400 troops to the " partnering " operations with the afghan army .

" our aerial transport capacities in particular are not sufficient up north .

as of summer 2010 , the german bundeswehr , too , will increasingly rely on " partnering " with afghan soldiers . german general bruno kasdorf , chief of staff at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul , explains the new concept : " partnering means living much more closely with the afghans , preparing operations , conducting them and doing the follow-up . "
whole isaf and afghan army units are set to operate jointly over long periods of time .
this strategy is supposed to prepare afghans to take charge of security in their country themselves .

one major says : " the ana is still all about fighting .
these soldiers sure know how to fight , that 's part of the afghan mentality .
but you also have to make them understand at times that fighting is not always the best option .
you should try to take over spaces not necessarily with your fire power , but also with planning .
you do n't intimidate the local population , but rather trust them .
that 's something which the afghan army and police still have to learn . "

the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .

the agreement ends decades of negotiation over the inhospitable area believed to be rich in oil and gas deposits . the leaders of russia and norway voiced satisfaction over a compromise that ends 40 years of dispute over their maritime frontiers .
" this solution is about more than a border line under the ocean .
it is about developing good neighborly relations , " norwegian prime minister jens stoltenberg said at a joint press with russian president dmitry medvedev in oslo .
" it will unite much more than divide , and it will become a bridge to cooperation , " he added .
disputes over the sea began in 1970 between norway and the soviet union , subsequently continuing with russia .
the 176,000 square kilometre -lrb- 67,950 square mile -rrb- zone lies off their arctic coastlines .
" i am glad that we have turned this page , " medvedev told the press conference .
" if problems are not solved definitively , then there is friction which presents a strain , " he said .
riches beneath the surface projects are already under way to exploit natural resources on both sides of the frontier , involving russian energy giant gazprom and the norwegian fuel supplier statoil .
canada , denmark , norway , russia and the united states have yet to agree on how to share the wider arctic seabed , which is estimated by the us geological survey to hold 90 billion barrels of oil as well as 30 percent of the world 's undiscovered gas resources .
the need to find a resolution has increased as new technology and global warming make the deposits more accessible. rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the alpha ventus wind park , germany 's first project of this type built offshore , is located 45 kilometers north of the german island of borkum in the north sea .
data collected from its 12 turbines are expected to help green energy specialists improve technology and construction methods for future off-shore wind farm projects .

the project was delayed as a result of bad weather and technical difficulties .
according to germany 's office of sea navigation and hydrography , up to 25 off-shore wind farms involving more than 1,650 turbines have been approved for construction in the north sea and baltic sea .

the alpha ventus wind park , germany 's first project of this type built off-shore , is located 45 kilometers north of the german island of borkum in the north sea .

alpha ventus is a collaborative effort by german energy giants e.on and ewe and swedish firm vattenfall .
the project was delayed as a result of bad weather and technical difficulties .
according to germany 's office of sea navigation and hydrography , up to 25 off-shore wind farms involving more than 1,650 turbines have been approved for construction in the north sea and baltic sea .

compliance experts say the move is part of a positive management trend . under its new management team , deutsche bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market . the state-owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , deutsche bahn international , by hiring professional services group kpmg to conduct a special audit .
new evidence uncovered the unit , which offers consultancy services worldwide to governments and other bodies planning and building railways , has been under investigation since 2005 for allegedly bribing officials in algeria , greece and rwanda .
but new evidence uncovered by prosecutors in frankfurt and presented to deutsche bahn last week prompted a decision for " swift action , " company spokesman jens-oliver voss told deutsche welle .

its new senior management team , he added , " has given compliance the highest possible priority . "
in march 2009 , hartmut mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of deutsche bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
his successor ruediger grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .
besides the new board position , grube has hired additional compliance staff and introduced training courses to " modernize compliance " and ensure that business practices across the company meet all legal requirements , according to peter von blomberg with transparency international , an organization that fights global corruption .
" over the past 12 months , deutsche bahn has done very much in the area of compliance , " he told deutsche welle .

earlier last week , deutsche bahn joined siemens , daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in russia .
both siemens and daimler have also been involved in large-scale bribery cases in russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .

political leaders welcomed her appointment , but rejected her comments . the state parliament of lower saxony swore in ayguel oezkan as minister of social affairs for the northern state on tuesday , making her the first female muslim minister in germany .
initially politicians and immigrant community leaders across the political spectrum praised the choice of oezkan by lower saxony state premier christian wulff .
however , her comments to weekly german magazine focus over the weekend criticizing the presence of crucifixes in state schools , ruffled feathers among her fellow conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" christian symbols do not belong in state schools , " the 38-year-old oezkan told the magazine .
" schools should be neutral places where children can decide their religious orientation on their own . "
she also said she thought headscarves did not belong in the classroom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democrats say the crucifixes in public schools are there to stay the response from the cdu was quick and clear .
" when it comes to religious neutrality , i have a fundamentally different view , " said armin laschet , the integration minister for north rhine-westphalia .

oezkan later apologized to her colleagues in hanover for the friction her comments had caused .
" ms. oezkan accepts that in lower saxony the crucifix is both welcome and desired in schools , " wulff said .
" she 's following the party line on this .
thus the issue is settled . "
while wulff may see the discussion as closed , there are some that wish oezkan would continue her push for secularism in the public schools .
" she had to take it back , but i think she was right , " kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany .
integration in action but wulff , kolat , laschet and other cdu members agree that oezkan 's appointment is a good sign for germany .
saarland 's state premier peter mueller , told the newspaper the saarbruecker zeitung that he thought oezkan was a good choice .
" she is a testament to the willingness to integrate of our political system and especially of the cdu , " he said .
" it 's a joy for us , " said kolat , " that in the history of the federal republic of germany , 50 years after immigration began , we now have a female minister of turkish descent . "
speaking to deutschlandfunk public radio , laschet said that every politician has to correct himself or herself at some point .
" the real story is the happiness that a child of an immigrant worker , a tailor , passed her school leaving examinations , studied at a university , passed two judicial state examinations and has , for the first time , landed in a high public office in germany , " he said .
a cabinet shakeup oezkan and three other ministers were appointed last week by wulff in a cabinet reshuffle .
all are expected to be approved by the state parliament where a coalition majority of cdu and the free democrats rules .
oezkan was born in hamburg to turkish immigrants and is a trained lawyer .
she has been the cdu 's economic policy spokeswoman for the regional parliamentary group in hamburg. hf / apn / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

compliance experts say the move is part of a positive management trend . under its new management team , deutsche bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market . the state-owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , deutsche bahn international , by hiring professional services group kpmg to conduct a special audit .

in march 2009 , hartmut mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of deutsche bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
his successor ruediger grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .

earlier last week , deutsche bahn joined siemens , daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in russia .
both siemens and daimler have also been involved in large-scale bribery cases in russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .

the idea behind it is that cities can learn from each other and raise their lobbying power at international climate negotiations .
bicycle-friendly copenhagen large cities are ahead of the game particularly when it comes to transport policies .
one of the leaders is the global " cycle capital " copenhagen , which has been promoting the use of bicycles since the 1960s .
" some 37 percent of our commuters ride to work on bicycles .
we want to build bicycle paths all over the city .
only a few street sections do n't have bike lanes , " lasse lindholm , a spokesman for copenhagen 's city government , said .
the city 's bicycle-friendly policies include a city-wide bike rental system and large bike parking lots .
it 's triggered a number of copycat efforts in barcelona and paris , which are expanding their own city bike rental programs .
promoting bicycles is a vital part of transportation policy in cities such as stockholm , amsterdam , vienna and oslo , which are considered particularly environmentally-friendly in europe .
green is the way to go mexico city , too , is expanding its bike rental system together with pedestrian zones , modern and high-speed bus services , new bus lanes and a subway line .
the mega-city plans to invest a billion dollars per year on it .
the colombian capital bogota is already reaping the benefits of expanding its public bus services .
it 's estimated that it 's cut travelling time for commuters by more than 30 percent and lowered carbon emissions by 300,000 tons a year .
london has managed to bring down its greenhouse-gas emissions by 16 percent ever since it introduced an inner city car toll in 2003 .
that has also reduced motorized traffic by 20 percent .
the car toll has earned the city almost 140 million euros , which it has partially invested in the expansion of its public transportation network .
stockholm has now followed suit and introduced a similar car toll in 2007 .
at the same time , the swedish capital has outfitted its busses with hybrid engines , biogas or ethanol .
that 's one of the reasons why stockholm was declared the " european green capital " 2010 by the european union .
hamburg eyes ambitious climate targets next year , hamburg is to get the title .
one major reason is the northern german city 's green transport policies .

" and hamburg 's regional train network only runs on green energy from hydropower - the first german rail company to do so . "
the city is hoping to achieve an ambitious climate goal - it plans to slash carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050 .
it 's already taken a first step toward that goal .
the city 's per-capita emission rate has already sunk 15 percent compared to 1990 levels .
" it 's a significant success for the city , " according to the eu commission .

this is where smart green ideas in the transport sector are developed and implemented - often with encouraging results . global climate policy is usually dominated and steered by countries and international organizations .
but , as the climate change summit in copenhagen last year showed , there 's a new player on the global stage - cities .
for the first time , a group of city mayors met for their own summit in the danish capital last year .
they made clear that much of the policies for combating global warming now depends on them .
cities make up 80 percent of global energy needs .
and they are responsible for 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions .
" that 's why cities must take a leading role in climate protection - they do n't just contribute the most to climate change but will also feel the impact of it the most , " reinhold achatz , head of the research department of engineering giant siemens , who studies urban climate policy , said .
cities make up just three percent of the earth 's surface , but half of the world 's population lives in them .

compliance experts say the move is part of a positive management trend . under its new management team , deutsche bahn appears more determined than ever to crack down on corruption , especially as the railway operator prepares to expand beyond its home market . the state-owned company , which has been stung by a string of corruption scandals in recent years , responded to new evidence of bribery in its consulting arm , deutsche bahn international , by hiring professional services group kpmg to conduct a special audit .
new evidence uncovered the unit , which offers consultancy services worldwide to governments and other bodies planning and building railways , has been under investigation since 2005 for allegedly bribing officials in algeria , greece and rwanda .
but new evidence uncovered by prosecutors in frankfurt and presented to deutsche bahn last week prompted a decision for " swift action , " company spokesman jens-oliver voss told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn spied on staff in a scandal that forced ceo mehdorn to resign voss said deutsche bahn has a fundamental interest in uncovering the truth about the transactions , noting that the company itself brought details of irregularities to the attention of prosecutors last year .
its new senior management team , he added , " has given compliance the highest possible priority . "
in march 2009 , hartmut mehdorn was forced to resign as chief executive officer of deutsche bahn after being accused of breaching privacy laws while monitoring staff contacts with suppliers .
his successor ruediger grube introduced many changes , including the creation of a new board position for compliance , legal affairs , data protection and security .
besides the new board position , grube has hired additional compliance staff and introduced training courses to " modernize compliance " and ensure that business practices across the company meet all legal requirements , according to peter von blomberg with transparency international , an organization that fights global corruption .
" over the past 12 months , deutsche bahn has done very much in the area of compliance , " he told deutsche welle .
" but it still needs to implement some steps . "
siemens scandal fallout numerous german companies with large international operations have given compliance and anti-corruption initiatives greater focus following the siemens scandal over bribes for international engineering contracts , according to von blomberg .
" this scandal created a lot of attention – negative attention – and resulted in numerous german companies taking a tougher stance on fighting corruption , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens scandal has prompted tough anti-corruption action deutsche bahn has ambitious international expansion plans .
on thursday , the railway company agreed to buy british train and bus operator arriva in a strategic push to expand in europe 's increasingly open rail markets .
and the company appears to be aware that as it grows abroad , so , too , do the opportunities for corruption .
earlier last week , deutsche bahn joined siemens , daimler and several other foreign companies involved in bribery probes in their home countries to sign an anti-corruption pact aimed at curtailing illegal business practices in russia .
both siemens and daimler have also been involved in large-scale bribery cases in russia , where organized corruption is a huge issue .
under the pact , the companies agreed to prohibit bribery in their operations - both directly and indirectly through intermediaries- and to encourage their suppliers and local counterparts to do so as well .
they also commit to refrain from covert forms of bribery such as donations and support of political parties .
companies can whistle-blow " this is a voluntary code of conduct – but one with teeth , " said brook horowitz , executive director of the international business leaders forum , which also signed on to the project along with the american chamber of commerce and the association of european businesses .
he said the pact includes a number of " tough measures " such as the possibility for companies to whistle-blow . in transparency international 's annual corruption perception index of 180 countries , germany ranked 14 .
new zealand was awarded the top ranking with the least corruption , while somalia performed worst .
despite the bribery scandals with a few high-profile companies such as daimler and siemens , " germany has managed to be a global exporter without being a leader in corruption , " von blomberg said .

needing 60 votes in the 100-seat senate to begin debating the bill , democratic leaders fell three votes short .
democratic senator ben nelson joined 39 republicans in voting against it .
republicans say the bill does not go far enough in its reforms , while democrats say their opponents want to protect wealthy corporate interests .
both parties say they expect the overhaul will eventually be approved .
correspondents say that with wall street reeling from a fraud case against goldman sachs they are eager to act before november 's congressional elections .
goldman executives are due to appear before a senate committee later .
on monday , the committee said the bank had made billions of dollars at its clients ' expense during the housing market collapse .
' obstruction ' minutes after monday 's procedural vote , president barack obama said he was " deeply disappointed " that republicans had rejected a debate and urged senators to put the interests of country ahead of party .
mardell 's america win or lose , in the short term at least , democrats win mark mardell bbc north america editor read mark 's thoughts in full " some of these senators may believe that this obstruction is a good political strategy , and others may see delay as an opportunity to take this debate behind closed doors , where financial industry lobbyists can water down reform or kill it altogether , " he said .
" but the american people ca n't afford that . "
it is likely that the democrats will try again later this week to push through a debate .
senate majority leader harry reid switched his vote to " no " at the end - a manoeuvre that will enable him to call for a new vote as early as tuesday .
" the only thing republicans stand for is standing together , " he said .
the democratic dissenter , sen nelson , said his vote reflected concerns about the bill from businessmen in his home state .
nebraska-based billionaire warren buffett has reportedly been lobbying to exempt existing derivatives from new regulations .
analysts say that with neither side appearing to be willing to compromise over the shape of the bill , further delays look likely .
all of us want to deliver a reform that will tighten the screws on wall street , but we 're not going to be rushed mitch mcconnell republican senate leader last-minute talks had already taken place to try to reach a compromise before the vote .
but senate minority leader mitch mcconnell had urged his side to stand firm .
" all of us want to deliver a reform that will tighten the screws on wall street .
but we 're not going to be rushed on another massive bill based on the assurances of our friends on the other side , " he said .
democrats and their two independent allies control 59 senate seats , but had needed at least one republican vote to overcome delaying tactics .
the bill 's supporters say it would tackle financial institutions that are " too big to fail " , putting in place a framework that would mean taxpayers do not fund any future bailouts .
among the bill 's proposals are changes to the derivatives market and tougher legislation to protect consumers .
mr obama has made reining in wall street a cornerstone of his presidency .
in a speech last week to the financial community , he attacked the army of lobbyists in washington employed by banks to oppose his changes .
a poll published in the washington post on monday suggests two-thirds of americans support stricter financial regulations .
