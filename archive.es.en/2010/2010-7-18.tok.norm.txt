the parliamentarians have also called on the colombian government to give a full accounting of alleged illegal activity in europe of the department of administrative security -lrb- das -rrb- , the colombian agency charged with internal security . " the colombian government needs to clarify in what way the das acted against non-governmental or political organizations to influence and disqualify decisions made by the human rights commission for the european parliament , " lochbihler and hautala said in a statement on the eve of the eu 's signing of a free-trade agreement with colombia .
some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on . " the eu 's top diplomat said she 'd discuss the issue further in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . call for more crossings european governments have urged israel to increase the number of crossing points and ease restrictions on the movement of people . israel says it now blocks only weapons and goods that could be put to military use . but the limited opening has drawn criticism from the palestinians and rights groups . " what we have today is 75 percent less -lsb- volume of traffic -rsb- than what we had in the first half of 2007 ...
that 's not what we are looking for , " fayyad told reporters .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants israel to ease restrictions on people crossing gaza 's borders ashton travelled to israel where she met with foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive . " for his part , lieberman said he had told ashton about israel 's " new , liberal approach to gaza " and called on the eu to support several large-scale infrastructure projects there " like power stations , desalination plants and water purification . " lieberman was pushing such projects as a prelude to israel , which supplies much of gaza 's utilities , cutting ties to the gaza strip , according to israeli media reports . gaza 's role in two state solution lieberman said israel was looking into the proposal but added that no official decisions had been made . ashton expressed her opposition to such a move . " i have consistently said the solution is a two state solution ... and gaza should be part of that , " she said .
" i made that position clear to foreign minister lieberman . " ashton was to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu later sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2010 hamburg mayor and merkel ally ole von beust steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust had led hamburg 's government since 2001 angela merkel 's government lost another powerful ally on sunday as hamburg mayor ole von beust said he would leave office as of august 25 .
two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .
of germany 's 16 states , 10 are ruled by premiers from the cdu or its bavarian sister party the csu .
only one of the 10 , peter mueller of saarland , has long experience at the helm of a regional government . it seems only two cdu / csu figures are to remain in government who are widely considered as potential chancellors , both of them hailing from merkel 's cabinet : neither germany 's minister of labor and social affairs ursula von der leyen nor defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg have had executive experience at the local level running a german state or city-state . author : mark hallam , catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the parliamentarians have also called on the colombian government to give a full accounting of alleged illegal activity in europe of the department of administrative security -lrb- das -rrb- , the colombian agency charged with internal security . " the colombian government needs to clarify in what way the das acted against non-governmental or political organizations to influence and disqualify decisions made by the human rights commission for the european parliament , " lochbihler and hautala said in a statement on the eve of the eu 's signing of a free-trade agreement with colombia .
some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on . " the eu 's top diplomat said she 'd discuss the issue further in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . call for more crossings european governments have urged israel to increase the number of crossing points and ease restrictions on the movement of people . israel says it now blocks only weapons and goods that could be put to military use . but the limited opening has drawn criticism from the palestinians and rights groups . " what we have today is 75 percent less -lsb- volume of traffic -rsb- than what we had in the first half of 2007 ...
that 's not what we are looking for , " fayyad told reporters .
" the economy of gaza can not be sustained only by importation , there needs to be exports . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants israel to ease restrictions on people crossing gaza 's borders ashton travelled to israel where she met with foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive . " for his part , lieberman said he had told ashton about israel 's " new , liberal approach to gaza " and called on the eu to support several large-scale infrastructure projects there " like power stations , desalination plants and water purification . " lieberman was pushing such projects as a prelude to israel , which supplies much of gaza 's utilities , cutting ties to the gaza strip , according to israeli media reports . gaza 's role in two state solution lieberman said israel was looking into the proposal but added that no official decisions had been made . ashton expressed her opposition to such a move . " i have consistently said the solution is a two state solution ... and gaza should be part of that , " she said .
" i made that position clear to foreign minister lieberman . " ashton was to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu later sunday .
she was not due to meet with officials from hamas , which is on us and eu lists of terrorist organizations . israel began the blockade of gaza in june 2006 after a soldier was captured by gaza militants and tightened restrictions a year later , when elections brought hamas to power . richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that means budapest will lose access to what remains of a 19.4 billion -lrb- $ 25.1 billion -rrb- loan package , created by the eu and imf , currently being used to support government finances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn said tough decisions needed to be taken by hungary " the correction of the excessive deficit by next year will require tough decisions , notably on spending , " said eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" care will also be needed to ensure a stable environment for both domestic and international investors . "
hungary vowed to slash its deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year - and 3 percent in 2011 - as part of the lifeline agreement with the eu , imf and world bank in 2008 .
hungarian finance minister gyorgy matolcsy said hungary was keen to resume negotiations .
" the government will of course continue talks with international organizations including the imf and the eu , " he said in a statement published by the national news agency mti .
last month , prime minister viktor orban unveiled austerity measures , including efficiency savings worth up to 430 million euros and a tax on banks .
measures ' fall short ' however , the european commission said the corrective measures are " largely of a temporary nature " and " fall somewhat short " of what is required .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister viktor orban has already introduced austerity measures the imf said it was vital for hungary to reassure markets by achieving the budgetary targets .
" in an environment of heightened market scrutiny of government deficits and debt levels , the fiscal deficit targets previously announced … remain an appropriate anchor for the necessary consolidation process and debt sustainability , and should be adhered to , but additional measures will need to be taken to achieve these objectives , " the imf said in a statement on saturday .
the good news is that hungary has returned to a positive economic growth path following the global economic downturn and actually has one of the lowest budget deficits in the eu .
analysts warned on saturday that hungary 's forint currency could drop in value when financial markets reopen on monday , due to uncertainty over the international safety net .

two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .
of germany 's 16 states , 10 are ruled by premiers from the cdu or its bavarian sister party the csu .
only one of the 10 , peter mueller of saarland , has long experience at the helm of a regional government . it seems only two cdu / csu figures are to remain in government who are widely considered as potential chancellors , both of them hailing from merkel 's cabinet : neither germany 's minister of labor and social affairs ursula von der leyen nor defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg have had executive experience at the local level running a german state or city-state . author : mark hallam , catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .

before the show on saturday , the 76-year-old film director of " the pianist " and " chinatown " told swiss television station tsr that he was uncertain about his immediate plans .
" for the moment i 'm happy to be free , " he said .
polanski thanked the inhabitants of the town of gstaad in southeastern switzerland , for their support since he was placed under house arrest at his luxury chalet there last year .
polanski said he maintained " a great friendship for switzerland and above all ... for its people who solidly supported me . "
his wife , 44-year-old french actress and singer emmanuelle seigner began her performance at the festival with the theme song from polanski 's 1968 film " rosemary 's baby . "
us to continue to seek " justice " polanski was arested in zurich last september where he had been invited to receive a film festival achievement award , on the basis of a us extradition request . earlier this week , swiss authorities refused the request by the us to extradite polanski to the united states to face sentencing for having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 .
us officials said they were " disappointed " by the swiss decision and would continue to seek " justice , " while international police agency interpol said on tuesday that polanski was still listed as wanted . france , where polanski is a long-term resident , has no extradition treaty with the united states that covers the offense .
poland , where polanksi also has citizenship , has said it would not extradite him .

some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .
of germany 's 16 states , 10 are ruled by premiers from the cdu or its bavarian sister party the csu .
only one of the 10 , peter mueller of saarland , has long experience at the helm of a regional government . it seems only two cdu / csu figures are to remain in government who are widely considered as potential chancellors , both of them hailing from merkel 's cabinet : neither germany 's minister of labor and social affairs ursula von der leyen nor defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg have had executive experience at the local level running a german state or city-state . author : mark hallam , catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some key data remains under wraps . it 's one of the country 's worst-kept secrets . yet questions still surround the presence of former nazis and war criminals in west germany 's police , secret service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and politics . who were those people , what positions did they hold in nazi germany and later in post-war west germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police collected information to blackmail or discredit its capitalist neighbor crucial information about the bnd 's past has long been hidden in the stasi files - the vast archive of information meticulously gathered by former communist east germany 's secret police , the stasi . the aim was to either blackmail western agents or to discredit its capitalist neighbor to the west . after reunification some of those documents were made available , but parts of the archives remained locked away for reasons of data privacy . continuity between nazis and west germany recently , the last remaining documents from the stasi files were released to the public . journalist andreas foerster had requested them as early as the year 2000 , but his request was turned down twice .
after persisting for years , he was finally granted access . foerster outlined how one policeman climbed through the nazi ranks and was ultimately employed after the war by west germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , the domestic security service . " in 1944 , he became an ss member and worked in the dachau concentration camp , " foerster said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the nazi documents indicate he did such a good job that he was transferred to auschwitz .
there , he worked in the so-called department for pest control - that 's where they ordered and received the cyclon b gas which was then used in the gas chambers of auschwitz . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one employee of west germany 's spy agency had worked at the auschwitz concentration camp the main task of west germany 's secret service after world war ii was to work against the soviet union , and when it came to recruiting staff , a nazi past was often overlooked if the recruit seemed capable of playing a useful role in the new struggle against communism . the nazi past of those cases was well known to their organizations , but it just did n't seem to matter , foerster said . much of the information being released in germany is already available in the united states .
the 1998 nazi war criminal disclosure act led to the cia releasing more than 700 files on germans with whom the us had worked in the aftermath of world war ii - even though they were known war criminals . reluctance to confront the past west germany 's intelligence service had a relatively high number of former nazis and war criminals in its ranks in its early years . " some 20 to 25 percent of the secret service were former ss men , " erich schmidt-eenboom , the head of a research institute that monitors intelligence services , told deutsche welle . " but if you broaden this to include the generals and officers in the regular armed forces , the wehrmacht , who 'd been involved in war crimes - then this may add up to 50 percent of the gehlen organization , which was initiated by the cia and was the immediate predecessor to the secret service , being made up of war criminals , " he added . the bnd itself was formed out of the gehlen organization , headed by legendary spymaster reinhard gehlen - a former german army general who worked as an intelligence officer on hitler 's eastern front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard gehlen - wehrmacht general turned west german intelligence chief over the years , the bnd has made several attempts to shed some light on its shady past .
between 1962 and 1965 , an internal inquiry looked into its members ' nazi links .
as a result , 70 people had to leave the secret service .
but they were only a fraction of the number who should have been sent packing , critics have said . the domestic intelligence service did a similar internal inquiry and also let a number of people go . " but these things were all only internal inquiries , " foerster said .
" that 's what these organizations still stand to answer for .
those who had to leave left quietly and , of course , still get their pension .
neither the bnd nor the domestic intelligence service have to this day openly dealt with their nazi roots " the stasi documents on the issue are now finally all open to research .
what remains classified are archives of the organizations themselves . in 2006 , the bnd said it would fund a research project into its own past , but little progress has been made .

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on .

but some key data remains under wraps . it 's one of the country 's worst-kept secrets . yet questions still surround the presence of former nazis and war criminals in west germany 's police , secret service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and politics . who were those people , what positions did they hold in nazi germany and later in post-war west germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police collected information to blackmail or discredit its capitalist neighbor crucial information about the bnd 's past has long been hidden in the stasi files - the vast archive of information meticulously gathered by former communist east germany 's secret police , the stasi . the aim was to either blackmail western agents or to discredit its capitalist neighbor to the west . after reunification some of those documents were made available , but parts of the archives remained locked away for reasons of data privacy . continuity between nazis and west germany recently , the last remaining documents from the stasi files were released to the public . journalist andreas foerster had requested them as early as the year 2000 , but his request was turned down twice .
after persisting for years , he was finally granted access . foerster outlined how one policeman climbed through the nazi ranks and was ultimately employed after the war by west germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , the domestic security service . " in 1944 , he became an ss member and worked in the dachau concentration camp , " foerster said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the nazi documents indicate he did such a good job that he was transferred to auschwitz .
there , he worked in the so-called department for pest control - that 's where they ordered and received the cyclon b gas which was then used in the gas chambers of auschwitz . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one employee of west germany 's spy agency had worked at the auschwitz concentration camp the main task of west germany 's secret service after world war ii was to work against the soviet union , and when it came to recruiting staff , a nazi past was often overlooked if the recruit seemed capable of playing a useful role in the new struggle against communism . the nazi past of those cases was well known to their organizations , but it just did n't seem to matter , foerster said . much of the information being released in germany is already available in the united states .
the 1998 nazi war criminal disclosure act led to the cia releasing more than 700 files on germans with whom the us had worked in the aftermath of world war ii - even though they were known war criminals . reluctance to confront the past west germany 's intelligence service had a relatively high number of former nazis and war criminals in its ranks in its early years . " some 20 to 25 percent of the secret service were former ss men , " erich schmidt-eenboom , the head of a research institute that monitors intelligence services , told deutsche welle . " but if you broaden this to include the generals and officers in the regular armed forces , the wehrmacht , who 'd been involved in war crimes - then this may add up to 50 percent of the gehlen organization , which was initiated by the cia and was the immediate predecessor to the secret service , being made up of war criminals , " he added . the bnd itself was formed out of the gehlen organization , headed by legendary spymaster reinhard gehlen - a former german army general who worked as an intelligence officer on hitler 's eastern front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard gehlen - wehrmacht general turned west german intelligence chief over the years , the bnd has made several attempts to shed some light on its shady past .
between 1962 and 1965 , an internal inquiry looked into its members ' nazi links .
as a result , 70 people had to leave the secret service .
but they were only a fraction of the number who should have been sent packing , critics have said . the domestic intelligence service did a similar internal inquiry and also let a number of people go . " but these things were all only internal inquiries , " foerster said .
" that 's what these organizations still stand to answer for .
those who had to leave left quietly and , of course , still get their pension .
neither the bnd nor the domestic intelligence service have to this day openly dealt with their nazi roots " the stasi documents on the issue are now finally all open to research .
what remains classified are archives of the organizations themselves . in 2006 , the bnd said it would fund a research project into its own past , but little progress has been made .

" as he spoke , hundreds of protestors marched through the conference centre demanding that rich nations deliver on their promise that all those in need of aids drugs should get them .
the protestors were waving placards and shouting " broken promises kill , " briefly delaying the ceremonial start to the 18th international aids conference . serious political leadership problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of those who need aids drugs currently get them the head of the international aids society , and conference chairman , julio montaner rebuked politicians for failing to deliver on their promise , saying that only a third of the 15 million people who need potentially life-saving aids drugs currently get them . " we have treatments that work , we have shown that this can be done ... what we need now is the political will to go the extra mile to deliver on universal access , " he said .
" we have a serious problem with the political leadership globally and we have to fix it . " in a brief video message at the start of the six-day forum , un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged countries to stick to their commitments on aids . " some governments are cutting back on their response to aids , " he said .
" this should be a cause for great concern to us all . " a report published at the conference by the joint united nations program on hiv / aids -lrb- unaids -rrb- found that overall support for the global aids effort from donor nations flattened out last year in the midst of the global economic crisis . in 2009 , the group of eight leading wealthy nations , the european commission and other donor governments provided $ 7.6 billion for aids relief in developing nations , compared with $ 7.7 billion in 2008 , the report said . rising infections in eastern europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial support for hiv / aid flattened over the last year montaner also criticized governments in eastern europe and central asia for not recognizing the risk posed by hiv / aids and not sending representatives to the conference .
he accused them of " irresponsibility to the point of criminal negligence . " the conference will focus on the rising numbers of infections in eastern europe and on the human rights of infected people . worldwide , there were some 33.4 million people living with hiv in 2008 .
sub-saharan africa , home to 67 percent of all people with the aids virus , is the most affected region .

" as he spoke , hundreds of protestors marched through the conference centre demanding that rich nations deliver on their promise that all those in need of aids drugs should get them .
the protestors were waving placards and shouting " broken promises kill , " briefly delaying the ceremonial start to the 18th international aids conference . serious political leadership problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of those who need aids drugs currently get them the head of the international aids society , and conference chairman , julio montaner rebuked politicians for failing to deliver on their promise , saying that only a third of the 15 million people who need potentially life-saving aids drugs currently get them .

" we have a serious problem with the political leadership globally and we have to fix it . " in a brief video message at the start of the six-day forum , un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged countries to stick to their commitments on aids . " some governments are cutting back on their response to aids , " he said .
" this should be a cause for great concern to us all . " a report published at the conference by the joint united nations program on hiv / aids -lrb- unaids -rrb- found that overall support for the global aids effort from donor nations flattened out last year in the midst of the global economic crisis . in 2009 , the group of eight leading wealthy nations , the european commission and other donor governments provided $ 7.6 billion for aids relief in developing nations , compared with $ 7.7 billion in 2008 , the report said . rising infections in eastern europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial support for hiv / aid flattened over the last year montaner also criticized governments in eastern europe and central asia for not recognizing the risk posed by hiv / aids and not sending representatives to the conference .
he accused them of " irresponsibility to the point of criminal negligence . " the conference will focus on the rising numbers of infections in eastern europe and on the human rights of infected people . worldwide , there were some 33.4 million people living with hiv in 2008 .

two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .
of germany 's 16 states , 10 are ruled by premiers from the cdu or its bavarian sister party the csu .
only one of the 10 , peter mueller of saarland , has long experience at the helm of a regional government . it seems only two cdu / csu figures are to remain in government who are widely considered as potential chancellors , both of them hailing from merkel 's cabinet : neither germany 's minister of labor and social affairs ursula von der leyen nor defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg have had executive experience at the local level running a german state or city-state . author : mark hallam , catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .
of germany 's 16 states , 10 are ruled by premiers from the cdu or its bavarian sister party the csu .
only one of the 10 , peter mueller of saarland , has long experience at the helm of a regional government . it seems only two cdu / csu figures are to remain in government who are widely considered as potential chancellors , both of them hailing from merkel 's cabinet : neither germany 's minister of labor and social affairs ursula von der leyen nor defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg have had executive experience at the local level running a german state or city-state . author : mark hallam , catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as he spoke , hundreds of protestors marched through the conference centre demanding that rich nations deliver on their promise that all those in need of aids drugs should get them .
the protestors were waving placards and shouting " broken promises kill , " briefly delaying the ceremonial start to the 18th international aids conference . serious political leadership problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of those who need aids drugs currently get them the head of the international aids society , and conference chairman , julio montaner rebuked politicians for failing to deliver on their promise , saying that only a third of the 15 million people who need potentially life-saving aids drugs currently get them . " we have treatments that work , we have shown that this can be done ... what we need now is the political will to go the extra mile to deliver on universal access , " he said .
" we have a serious problem with the political leadership globally and we have to fix it . " in a brief video message at the start of the six-day forum , un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged countries to stick to their commitments on aids . " some governments are cutting back on their response to aids , " he said .
" this should be a cause for great concern to us all . " a report published at the conference by the joint united nations program on hiv / aids -lrb- unaids -rrb- found that overall support for the global aids effort from donor nations flattened out last year in the midst of the global economic crisis . in 2009 , the group of eight leading wealthy nations , the european commission and other donor governments provided $ 7.6 billion for aids relief in developing nations , compared with $ 7.7 billion in 2008 , the report said . rising infections in eastern europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial support for hiv / aid flattened over the last year montaner also criticized governments in eastern europe and central asia for not recognizing the risk posed by hiv / aids and not sending representatives to the conference .
he accused them of " irresponsibility to the point of criminal negligence . " the conference will focus on the rising numbers of infections in eastern europe and on the human rights of infected people . worldwide , there were some 33.4 million people living with hiv in 2008 .
sub-saharan africa , home to 67 percent of all people with the aids virus , is the most affected region .

but some key data remains under wraps . it 's one of the country 's worst-kept secrets . yet questions still surround the presence of former nazis and war criminals in west germany 's police , secret service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and politics . who were those people , what positions did they hold in nazi germany and later in post-war west germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police collected information to blackmail or discredit its capitalist neighbor crucial information about the bnd 's past has long been hidden in the stasi files - the vast archive of information meticulously gathered by former communist east germany 's secret police , the stasi . the aim was to either blackmail western agents or to discredit its capitalist neighbor to the west . after reunification some of those documents were made available , but parts of the archives remained locked away for reasons of data privacy . continuity between nazis and west germany recently , the last remaining documents from the stasi files were released to the public . journalist andreas foerster had requested them as early as the year 2000 , but his request was turned down twice .
after persisting for years , he was finally granted access . foerster outlined how one policeman climbed through the nazi ranks and was ultimately employed after the war by west germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , the domestic security service . " in 1944 , he became an ss member and worked in the dachau concentration camp , " foerster said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the nazi documents indicate he did such a good job that he was transferred to auschwitz .
there , he worked in the so-called department for pest control - that 's where they ordered and received the cyclon b gas which was then used in the gas chambers of auschwitz . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one employee of west germany 's spy agency had worked at the auschwitz concentration camp the main task of west germany 's secret service after world war ii was to work against the soviet union , and when it came to recruiting staff , a nazi past was often overlooked if the recruit seemed capable of playing a useful role in the new struggle against communism . the nazi past of those cases was well known to their organizations , but it just did n't seem to matter , foerster said . much of the information being released in germany is already available in the united states .
the 1998 nazi war criminal disclosure act led to the cia releasing more than 700 files on germans with whom the us had worked in the aftermath of world war ii - even though they were known war criminals . reluctance to confront the past west germany 's intelligence service had a relatively high number of former nazis and war criminals in its ranks in its early years . " some 20 to 25 percent of the secret service were former ss men , " erich schmidt-eenboom , the head of a research institute that monitors intelligence services , told deutsche welle . " but if you broaden this to include the generals and officers in the regular armed forces , the wehrmacht , who 'd been involved in war crimes - then this may add up to 50 percent of the gehlen organization , which was initiated by the cia and was the immediate predecessor to the secret service , being made up of war criminals , " he added . the bnd itself was formed out of the gehlen organization , headed by legendary spymaster reinhard gehlen - a former german army general who worked as an intelligence officer on hitler 's eastern front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard gehlen - wehrmacht general turned west german intelligence chief over the years , the bnd has made several attempts to shed some light on its shady past .
between 1962 and 1965 , an internal inquiry looked into its members ' nazi links .
as a result , 70 people had to leave the secret service .
but they were only a fraction of the number who should have been sent packing , critics have said . the domestic intelligence service did a similar internal inquiry and also let a number of people go . " but these things were all only internal inquiries , " foerster said .
" that 's what these organizations still stand to answer for .
those who had to leave left quietly and , of course , still get their pension .
neither the bnd nor the domestic intelligence service have to this day openly dealt with their nazi roots " the stasi documents on the issue are now finally all open to research .
what remains classified are archives of the organizations themselves . in 2006 , the bnd said it would fund a research project into its own past , but little progress has been made .
the historian chosen for the project quit in 2008 over what he said was a lack of support for his work . author : andreas illmer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .

hungary vowed to slash its deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year - and 3 percent in 2011 - as part of the lifeline agreement with the eu , imf and world bank in 2008 .
hungarian finance minister gyorgy matolcsy said hungary was keen to resume negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 18.07.2010 eu lawmakers urge probe of colombian intelligence operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felipe munoz , director of the das , colombia 's secret police eu parliamentarians have called on the commission to look into colombian intelligence operations in europe designed to ‘ neutralize the influence ' of critics of the colombian government in parliament , the unhcr and ngos . the call is supported by the head of the parliament 's human rights commission , heidi hautala , british socialist richard howitt and green deputies ulrike lunacek and barbara lochbihler as well as the international federation of journalists and other ngos .
the parliamentarians have also called on the colombian government to give a full accounting of alleged illegal activity in europe of the department of administrative security -lrb- das -rrb- , the colombian agency charged with internal security . " the colombian government needs to clarify in what way the das acted against non-governmental or political organizations to influence and disqualify decisions made by the human rights commission for the european parliament , " lochbihler and hautala said in a statement on the eve of the eu 's signing of a free-trade agreement with colombia .
some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza .

" at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.07.2010 imf , eu suspend talks on emergency loan to hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's forint could become a victim of speculators the imf and the eu have suspended a review of hungary ’ s existing credit line , saying budapest needs to do more to slash its deficit and improve fiscal conditions . both the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the eu on saturday suspended a review of hungary 's funding program .
that means budapest will lose access to what remains of a 19.4 billion -lrb- $ 25.1 billion -rrb- loan package , created by the eu and imf , currently being used to support government finances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn said tough decisions needed to be taken by hungary " the correction of the excessive deficit by next year will require tough decisions , notably on spending , " said eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" care will also be needed to ensure a stable environment for both domestic and international investors . "
hungary vowed to slash its deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year - and 3 percent in 2011 - as part of the lifeline agreement with the eu , imf and world bank in 2008 .
hungarian finance minister gyorgy matolcsy said hungary was keen to resume negotiations .
" the government will of course continue talks with international organizations including the imf and the eu , " he said in a statement published by the national news agency mti .
last month , prime minister viktor orban unveiled austerity measures , including efficiency savings worth up to 430 million euros and a tax on banks .
measures ' fall short ' however , the european commission said the corrective measures are " largely of a temporary nature " and " fall somewhat short " of what is required .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister viktor orban has already introduced austerity measures the imf said it was vital for hungary to reassure markets by achieving the budgetary targets .
" in an environment of heightened market scrutiny of government deficits and debt levels , the fiscal deficit targets previously announced … remain an appropriate anchor for the necessary consolidation process and debt sustainability , and should be adhered to , but additional measures will need to be taken to achieve these objectives , " the imf said in a statement on saturday .
the good news is that hungary has returned to a positive economic growth path following the global economic downturn and actually has one of the lowest budget deficits in the eu .
analysts warned on saturday that hungary 's forint currency could drop in value when financial markets reopen on monday , due to uncertainty over the international safety net .

" as he spoke , hundreds of protestors marched through the conference centre demanding that rich nations deliver on their promise that all those in need of aids drugs should get them .

" in a brief video message at the start of the six-day forum , un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged countries to stick to their commitments on aids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 18.07.2010 eu lawmakers urge probe of colombian intelligence operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felipe munoz , director of the das , colombia 's secret police eu parliamentarians have called on the commission to look into colombian intelligence operations in europe designed to ‘ neutralize the influence ' of critics of the colombian government in parliament , the unhcr and ngos . the call is supported by the head of the parliament 's human rights commission , heidi hautala , british socialist richard howitt and green deputies ulrike lunacek and barbara lochbihler as well as the international federation of journalists and other ngos .
the parliamentarians have also called on the colombian government to give a full accounting of alleged illegal activity in europe of the department of administrative security -lrb- das -rrb- , the colombian agency charged with internal security . " the colombian government needs to clarify in what way the das acted against non-governmental or political organizations to influence and disqualify decisions made by the human rights commission for the european parliament , " lochbihler and hautala said in a statement on the eve of the eu 's signing of a free-trade agreement with colombia .
some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 18.07.2010 eu lawmakers urge probe of colombian intelligence operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felipe munoz , director of the das , colombia 's secret police eu parliamentarians have called on the commission to look into colombian intelligence operations in europe designed to ‘ neutralize the influence ' of critics of the colombian government in parliament , the unhcr and ngos . the call is supported by the head of the parliament 's human rights commission , heidi hautala , british socialist richard howitt and green deputies ulrike lunacek and barbara lochbihler as well as the international federation of journalists and other ngos .
the parliamentarians have also called on the colombian government to give a full accounting of alleged illegal activity in europe of the department of administrative security -lrb- das -rrb- , the colombian agency charged with internal security . " the colombian government needs to clarify in what way the das acted against non-governmental or political organizations to influence and disqualify decisions made by the human rights commission for the european parliament , " lochbihler and hautala said in a statement on the eve of the eu 's signing of a free-trade agreement with colombia .
some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 18.07.2010 eu lawmakers urge probe of colombian intelligence operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felipe munoz , director of the das , colombia 's secret police eu parliamentarians have called on the commission to look into colombian intelligence operations in europe designed to ‘ neutralize the influence ' of critics of the colombian government in parliament , the unhcr and ngos . the call is supported by the head of the parliament 's human rights commission , heidi hautala , british socialist richard howitt and green deputies ulrike lunacek and barbara lochbihler as well as the international federation of journalists and other ngos .
the parliamentarians have also called on the colombian government to give a full accounting of alleged illegal activity in europe of the department of administrative security -lrb- das -rrb- , the colombian agency charged with internal security . " the colombian government needs to clarify in what way the das acted against non-governmental or political organizations to influence and disqualify decisions made by the human rights commission for the european parliament , " lochbihler and hautala said in a statement on the eve of the eu 's signing of a free-trade agreement with colombia .
some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

" but if you broaden this to include the generals and officers in the regular armed forces , the wehrmacht , who 'd been involved in war crimes - then this may add up to 50 percent of the gehlen organization , which was initiated by the cia and was the immediate predecessor to the secret service , being made up of war criminals , " he added . the bnd itself was formed out of the gehlen organization , headed by legendary spymaster reinhard gehlen - a former german army general who worked as an intelligence officer on hitler 's eastern front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard gehlen - wehrmacht general turned west german intelligence chief over the years , the bnd has made several attempts to shed some light on its shady past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 18.07.2010 eu lawmakers urge probe of colombian intelligence operations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felipe munoz , director of the das , colombia 's secret police eu parliamentarians have called on the commission to look into colombian intelligence operations in europe designed to ‘ neutralize the influence ' of critics of the colombian government in parliament , the unhcr and ngos . the call is supported by the head of the parliament 's human rights commission , heidi hautala , british socialist richard howitt and green deputies ulrike lunacek and barbara lochbihler as well as the international federation of journalists and other ngos .
the parliamentarians have also called on the colombian government to give a full accounting of alleged illegal activity in europe of the department of administrative security -lrb- das -rrb- , the colombian agency charged with internal security . " the colombian government needs to clarify in what way the das acted against non-governmental or political organizations to influence and disqualify decisions made by the human rights commission for the european parliament , " lochbihler and hautala said in a statement on the eve of the eu 's signing of a free-trade agreement with colombia .
some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on . " the eu 's top diplomat said she 'd discuss the issue further in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . call for more crossings european governments have urged israel to increase the number of crossing points and ease restrictions on the movement of people . israel says it now blocks only weapons and goods that could be put to military use . but the limited opening has drawn criticism from the palestinians and rights groups .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants israel to ease restrictions on people crossing gaza 's borders ashton travelled to israel where she met with foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive . " for his part , lieberman said he had told ashton about israel 's " new , liberal approach to gaza " and called on the eu to support several large-scale infrastructure projects there " like power stations , desalination plants and water purification . " lieberman was pushing such projects as a prelude to israel , which supplies much of gaza 's utilities , cutting ties to the gaza strip , according to israeli media reports . gaza 's role in two state solution lieberman said israel was looking into the proposal but added that no official decisions had been made . ashton expressed her opposition to such a move .

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on .

she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive .

" as he spoke , hundreds of protestors marched through the conference centre demanding that rich nations deliver on their promise that all those in need of aids drugs should get them .
the protestors were waving placards and shouting " broken promises kill , " briefly delaying the ceremonial start to the 18th international aids conference . serious political leadership problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of those who need aids drugs currently get them the head of the international aids society , and conference chairman , julio montaner rebuked politicians for failing to deliver on their promise , saying that only a third of the 15 million people who need potentially life-saving aids drugs currently get them . " we have treatments that work , we have shown that this can be done ... what we need now is the political will to go the extra mile to deliver on universal access , " he said .
" we have a serious problem with the political leadership globally and we have to fix it . " in a brief video message at the start of the six-day forum , un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged countries to stick to their commitments on aids . " some governments are cutting back on their response to aids , " he said .
" this should be a cause for great concern to us all . " a report published at the conference by the joint united nations program on hiv / aids -lrb- unaids -rrb- found that overall support for the global aids effort from donor nations flattened out last year in the midst of the global economic crisis . in 2009 , the group of eight leading wealthy nations , the european commission and other donor governments provided $ 7.6 billion for aids relief in developing nations , compared with $ 7.7 billion in 2008 , the report said . rising infections in eastern europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial support for hiv / aid flattened over the last year montaner also criticized governments in eastern europe and central asia for not recognizing the risk posed by hiv / aids and not sending representatives to the conference .
he accused them of " irresponsibility to the point of criminal negligence . " the conference will focus on the rising numbers of infections in eastern europe and on the human rights of infected people . worldwide , there were some 33.4 million people living with hiv in 2008 .
sub-saharan africa , home to 67 percent of all people with the aids virus , is the most affected region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 18.07.2010 eu 's top diplomat visits gaza , pushes for open borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton wants israel to allow the flow of people and goods " in both directions " eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton pressed for the further easing of israel 's blockade of the gaza strip during her visit to the region .
ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on . " the eu 's top diplomat said she 'd discuss the issue further in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . call for more crossings european governments have urged israel to increase the number of crossing points and ease restrictions on the movement of people . israel says it now blocks only weapons and goods that could be put to military use . but the limited opening has drawn criticism from the palestinians and rights groups . " what we have today is 75 percent less -lsb- volume of traffic -rsb- than what we had in the first half of 2007 ...
that 's not what we are looking for , " fayyad told reporters .
" the economy of gaza can not be sustained only by importation , there needs to be exports . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants israel to ease restrictions on people crossing gaza 's borders ashton travelled to israel where she met with foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive . " for his part , lieberman said he had told ashton about israel 's " new , liberal approach to gaza " and called on the eu to support several large-scale infrastructure projects there " like power stations , desalination plants and water purification . " lieberman was pushing such projects as a prelude to israel , which supplies much of gaza 's utilities , cutting ties to the gaza strip , according to israeli media reports . gaza 's role in two state solution lieberman said israel was looking into the proposal but added that no official decisions had been made . ashton expressed her opposition to such a move . " i have consistently said the solution is a two state solution ... and gaza should be part of that , " she said .
" i made that position clear to foreign minister lieberman . " ashton was to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu later sunday .
she was not due to meet with officials from hamas , which is on us and eu lists of terrorist organizations . israel began the blockade of gaza in june 2006 after a soldier was captured by gaza militants and tightened restrictions a year later , when elections brought hamas to power . richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2010 hamburg mayor and merkel ally ole von beust steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust had led hamburg 's government since 2001 angela merkel 's government lost another powerful ally on sunday as hamburg mayor ole von beust said he would leave office as of august 25 .
two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .
of germany 's 16 states , 10 are ruled by premiers from the cdu or its bavarian sister party the csu .
only one of the 10 , peter mueller of saarland , has long experience at the helm of a regional government . it seems only two cdu / csu figures are to remain in government who are widely considered as potential chancellors , both of them hailing from merkel 's cabinet : neither germany 's minister of labor and social affairs ursula von der leyen nor defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg have had executive experience at the local level running a german state or city-state . author : mark hallam , catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" as he spoke , hundreds of protestors marched through the conference centre demanding that rich nations deliver on their promise that all those in need of aids drugs should get them .
the protestors were waving placards and shouting " broken promises kill , " briefly delaying the ceremonial start to the 18th international aids conference . serious political leadership problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of those who need aids drugs currently get them the head of the international aids society , and conference chairman , julio montaner rebuked politicians for failing to deliver on their promise , saying that only a third of the 15 million people who need potentially life-saving aids drugs currently get them . " we have treatments that work , we have shown that this can be done ... what we need now is the political will to go the extra mile to deliver on universal access , " he said .
" we have a serious problem with the political leadership globally and we have to fix it . " in a brief video message at the start of the six-day forum , un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged countries to stick to their commitments on aids . " some governments are cutting back on their response to aids , " he said .
" this should be a cause for great concern to us all . " a report published at the conference by the joint united nations program on hiv / aids -lrb- unaids -rrb- found that overall support for the global aids effort from donor nations flattened out last year in the midst of the global economic crisis . in 2009 , the group of eight leading wealthy nations , the european commission and other donor governments provided $ 7.6 billion for aids relief in developing nations , compared with $ 7.7 billion in 2008 , the report said . rising infections in eastern europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial support for hiv / aid flattened over the last year montaner also criticized governments in eastern europe and central asia for not recognizing the risk posed by hiv / aids and not sending representatives to the conference .
he accused them of " irresponsibility to the point of criminal negligence . " the conference will focus on the rising numbers of infections in eastern europe and on the human rights of infected people . worldwide , there were some 33.4 million people living with hiv in 2008 .
sub-saharan africa , home to 67 percent of all people with the aids virus , is the most affected region .

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on . " the eu 's top diplomat said she 'd discuss the issue further in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . call for more crossings european governments have urged israel to increase the number of crossing points and ease restrictions on the movement of people . israel says it now blocks only weapons and goods that could be put to military use . but the limited opening has drawn criticism from the palestinians and rights groups .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants israel to ease restrictions on people crossing gaza 's borders ashton travelled to israel where she met with foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive . " for his part , lieberman said he had told ashton about israel 's " new , liberal approach to gaza " and called on the eu to support several large-scale infrastructure projects there " like power stations , desalination plants and water purification . " lieberman was pushing such projects as a prelude to israel , which supplies much of gaza 's utilities , cutting ties to the gaza strip , according to israeli media reports . gaza 's role in two state solution lieberman said israel was looking into the proposal but added that no official decisions had been made . ashton expressed her opposition to such a move .

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future .

that means budapest will lose access to what remains of a 19.4 billion -lrb- $ 25.1 billion -rrb- loan package , created by the eu and imf , currently being used to support government finances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn said tough decisions needed to be taken by hungary " the correction of the excessive deficit by next year will require tough decisions , notably on spending , " said eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" care will also be needed to ensure a stable environment for both domestic and international investors . "
hungary vowed to slash its deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year - and 3 percent in 2011 - as part of the lifeline agreement with the eu , imf and world bank in 2008 .
hungarian finance minister gyorgy matolcsy said hungary was keen to resume negotiations .
" the government will of course continue talks with international organizations including the imf and the eu , " he said in a statement published by the national news agency mti .
last month , prime minister viktor orban unveiled austerity measures , including efficiency savings worth up to 430 million euros and a tax on banks .
measures ' fall short ' however , the european commission said the corrective measures are " largely of a temporary nature " and " fall somewhat short " of what is required .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister viktor orban has already introduced austerity measures the imf said it was vital for hungary to reassure markets by achieving the budgetary targets .
" in an environment of heightened market scrutiny of government deficits and debt levels , the fiscal deficit targets previously announced … remain an appropriate anchor for the necessary consolidation process and debt sustainability , and should be adhered to , but additional measures will need to be taken to achieve these objectives , " the imf said in a statement on saturday .
the good news is that hungary has returned to a positive economic growth path following the global economic downturn and actually has one of the lowest budget deficits in the eu .
analysts warned on saturday that hungary 's forint currency could drop in value when financial markets reopen on monday , due to uncertainty over the international safety net .

" as he spoke , hundreds of protestors marched through the conference centre demanding that rich nations deliver on their promise that all those in need of aids drugs should get them .
the protestors were waving placards and shouting " broken promises kill , " briefly delaying the ceremonial start to the 18th international aids conference . serious political leadership problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of those who need aids drugs currently get them the head of the international aids society , and conference chairman , julio montaner rebuked politicians for failing to deliver on their promise , saying that only a third of the 15 million people who need potentially life-saving aids drugs currently get them . " we have treatments that work , we have shown that this can be done ... what we need now is the political will to go the extra mile to deliver on universal access , " he said .
" we have a serious problem with the political leadership globally and we have to fix it . " in a brief video message at the start of the six-day forum , un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged countries to stick to their commitments on aids . " some governments are cutting back on their response to aids , " he said .
" this should be a cause for great concern to us all . " a report published at the conference by the joint united nations program on hiv / aids -lrb- unaids -rrb- found that overall support for the global aids effort from donor nations flattened out last year in the midst of the global economic crisis . in 2009 , the group of eight leading wealthy nations , the european commission and other donor governments provided $ 7.6 billion for aids relief in developing nations , compared with $ 7.7 billion in 2008 , the report said . rising infections in eastern europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial support for hiv / aid flattened over the last year montaner also criticized governments in eastern europe and central asia for not recognizing the risk posed by hiv / aids and not sending representatives to the conference .
he accused them of " irresponsibility to the point of criminal negligence . " the conference will focus on the rising numbers of infections in eastern europe and on the human rights of infected people . worldwide , there were some 33.4 million people living with hiv in 2008 .

two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .

many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .

two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.07.2010 imf , eu suspend talks on emergency loan to hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's forint could become a victim of speculators the imf and the eu have suspended a review of hungary ’ s existing credit line , saying budapest needs to do more to slash its deficit and improve fiscal conditions . both the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the eu on saturday suspended a review of hungary 's funding program .
that means budapest will lose access to what remains of a 19.4 billion -lrb- $ 25.1 billion -rrb- loan package , created by the eu and imf , currently being used to support government finances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn said tough decisions needed to be taken by hungary " the correction of the excessive deficit by next year will require tough decisions , notably on spending , " said eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" care will also be needed to ensure a stable environment for both domestic and international investors . "
hungary vowed to slash its deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year - and 3 percent in 2011 - as part of the lifeline agreement with the eu , imf and world bank in 2008 .
hungarian finance minister gyorgy matolcsy said hungary was keen to resume negotiations .
" the government will of course continue talks with international organizations including the imf and the eu , " he said in a statement published by the national news agency mti .
last month , prime minister viktor orban unveiled austerity measures , including efficiency savings worth up to 430 million euros and a tax on banks .
measures ' fall short ' however , the european commission said the corrective measures are " largely of a temporary nature " and " fall somewhat short " of what is required .

" as he spoke , hundreds of protestors marched through the conference centre demanding that rich nations deliver on their promise that all those in need of aids drugs should get them .
the protestors were waving placards and shouting " broken promises kill , " briefly delaying the ceremonial start to the 18th international aids conference . serious political leadership problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of those who need aids drugs currently get them the head of the international aids society , and conference chairman , julio montaner rebuked politicians for failing to deliver on their promise , saying that only a third of the 15 million people who need potentially life-saving aids drugs currently get them . " we have treatments that work , we have shown that this can be done ... what we need now is the political will to go the extra mile to deliver on universal access , " he said .
" we have a serious problem with the political leadership globally and we have to fix it . " in a brief video message at the start of the six-day forum , un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged countries to stick to their commitments on aids . " some governments are cutting back on their response to aids , " he said .
" this should be a cause for great concern to us all . " a report published at the conference by the joint united nations program on hiv / aids -lrb- unaids -rrb- found that overall support for the global aids effort from donor nations flattened out last year in the midst of the global economic crisis . in 2009 , the group of eight leading wealthy nations , the european commission and other donor governments provided $ 7.6 billion for aids relief in developing nations , compared with $ 7.7 billion in 2008 , the report said . rising infections in eastern europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : financial support for hiv / aid flattened over the last year montaner also criticized governments in eastern europe and central asia for not recognizing the risk posed by hiv / aids and not sending representatives to the conference .
he accused them of " irresponsibility to the point of criminal negligence . " the conference will focus on the rising numbers of infections in eastern europe and on the human rights of infected people . worldwide , there were some 33.4 million people living with hiv in 2008 .
sub-saharan africa , home to 67 percent of all people with the aids virus , is the most affected region .

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on . " the eu 's top diplomat said she 'd discuss the issue further in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . call for more crossings european governments have urged israel to increase the number of crossing points and ease restrictions on the movement of people . israel says it now blocks only weapons and goods that could be put to military use . but the limited opening has drawn criticism from the palestinians and rights groups . " what we have today is 75 percent less -lsb- volume of traffic -rsb- than what we had in the first half of 2007 ...
that 's not what we are looking for , " fayyad told reporters .
" the economy of gaza can not be sustained only by importation , there needs to be exports . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants israel to ease restrictions on people crossing gaza 's borders ashton travelled to israel where she met with foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive . " for his part , lieberman said he had told ashton about israel 's " new , liberal approach to gaza " and called on the eu to support several large-scale infrastructure projects there " like power stations , desalination plants and water purification . " lieberman was pushing such projects as a prelude to israel , which supplies much of gaza 's utilities , cutting ties to the gaza strip , according to israeli media reports . gaza 's role in two state solution lieberman said israel was looking into the proposal but added that no official decisions had been made . ashton expressed her opposition to such a move . " i have consistently said the solution is a two state solution ... and gaza should be part of that , " she said .
" i made that position clear to foreign minister lieberman . " ashton was to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu later sunday .
she was not due to meet with officials from hamas , which is on us and eu lists of terrorist organizations . israel began the blockade of gaza in june 2006 after a soldier was captured by gaza militants and tightened restrictions a year later , when elections brought hamas to power . richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on . " the eu 's top diplomat said she 'd discuss the issue further in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . call for more crossings european governments have urged israel to increase the number of crossing points and ease restrictions on the movement of people . israel says it now blocks only weapons and goods that could be put to military use . but the limited opening has drawn criticism from the palestinians and rights groups . " what we have today is 75 percent less -lsb- volume of traffic -rsb- than what we had in the first half of 2007 ...

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants israel to ease restrictions on people crossing gaza 's borders ashton travelled to israel where she met with foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive . " for his part , lieberman said he had told ashton about israel 's " new , liberal approach to gaza " and called on the eu to support several large-scale infrastructure projects there " like power stations , desalination plants and water purification . " lieberman was pushing such projects as a prelude to israel , which supplies much of gaza 's utilities , cutting ties to the gaza strip , according to israeli media reports . gaza 's role in two state solution lieberman said israel was looking into the proposal but added that no official decisions had been made . ashton expressed her opposition to such a move . " i have consistently said the solution is a two state solution ... and gaza should be part of that , " she said .
" i made that position clear to foreign minister lieberman . " ashton was to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu later sunday .
she was not due to meet with officials from hamas , which is on us and eu lists of terrorist organizations . israel began the blockade of gaza in june 2006 after a soldier was captured by gaza militants and tightened restrictions a year later , when elections brought hamas to power . richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hungary vowed to slash its deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year - and 3 percent in 2011 - as part of the lifeline agreement with the eu , imf and world bank in 2008 .
hungarian finance minister gyorgy matolcsy said hungary was keen to resume negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.07.2010 imf , eu suspend talks on emergency loan to hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's forint could become a victim of speculators the imf and the eu have suspended a review of hungary ’ s existing credit line , saying budapest needs to do more to slash its deficit and improve fiscal conditions . both the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the eu on saturday suspended a review of hungary 's funding program .
that means budapest will lose access to what remains of a 19.4 billion -lrb- $ 25.1 billion -rrb- loan package , created by the eu and imf , currently being used to support government finances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn said tough decisions needed to be taken by hungary " the correction of the excessive deficit by next year will require tough decisions , notably on spending , " said eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" care will also be needed to ensure a stable environment for both domestic and international investors . "
hungary vowed to slash its deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year - and 3 percent in 2011 - as part of the lifeline agreement with the eu , imf and world bank in 2008 .
hungarian finance minister gyorgy matolcsy said hungary was keen to resume negotiations .
" the government will of course continue talks with international organizations including the imf and the eu , " he said in a statement published by the national news agency mti .
last month , prime minister viktor orban unveiled austerity measures , including efficiency savings worth up to 430 million euros and a tax on banks .
measures ' fall short ' however , the european commission said the corrective measures are " largely of a temporary nature " and " fall somewhat short " of what is required .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister viktor orban has already introduced austerity measures the imf said it was vital for hungary to reassure markets by achieving the budgetary targets .
" in an environment of heightened market scrutiny of government deficits and debt levels , the fiscal deficit targets previously announced … remain an appropriate anchor for the necessary consolidation process and debt sustainability , and should be adhered to , but additional measures will need to be taken to achieve these objectives , " the imf said in a statement on saturday .
the good news is that hungary has returned to a positive economic growth path following the global economic downturn and actually has one of the lowest budget deficits in the eu .
analysts warned on saturday that hungary 's forint currency could drop in value when financial markets reopen on monday , due to uncertainty over the international safety net .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.07.2010 imf , eu suspend talks on emergency loan to hungary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's forint could become a victim of speculators the imf and the eu have suspended a review of hungary ’ s existing credit line , saying budapest needs to do more to slash its deficit and improve fiscal conditions . both the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the eu on saturday suspended a review of hungary 's funding program .
that means budapest will lose access to what remains of a 19.4 billion -lrb- $ 25.1 billion -rrb- loan package , created by the eu and imf , currently being used to support government finances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn said tough decisions needed to be taken by hungary " the correction of the excessive deficit by next year will require tough decisions , notably on spending , " said eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" care will also be needed to ensure a stable environment for both domestic and international investors . "
hungary vowed to slash its deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year - and 3 percent in 2011 - as part of the lifeline agreement with the eu , imf and world bank in 2008 .
hungarian finance minister gyorgy matolcsy said hungary was keen to resume negotiations .
" the government will of course continue talks with international organizations including the imf and the eu , " he said in a statement published by the national news agency mti .
last month , prime minister viktor orban unveiled austerity measures , including efficiency savings worth up to 430 million euros and a tax on banks .
measures ' fall short ' however , the european commission said the corrective measures are " largely of a temporary nature " and " fall somewhat short " of what is required .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister viktor orban has already introduced austerity measures the imf said it was vital for hungary to reassure markets by achieving the budgetary targets .
" in an environment of heightened market scrutiny of government deficits and debt levels , the fiscal deficit targets previously announced … remain an appropriate anchor for the necessary consolidation process and debt sustainability , and should be adhered to , but additional measures will need to be taken to achieve these objectives , " the imf said in a statement on saturday .
the good news is that hungary has returned to a positive economic growth path following the global economic downturn and actually has one of the lowest budget deficits in the eu .
analysts warned on saturday that hungary 's forint currency could drop in value when financial markets reopen on monday , due to uncertainty over the international safety net .

ashton said goods should also be allowed out of the region in future . on her second trip to the hamas-controlled territory in four months , ashton said she wanted israel to further lift its four-year blockade of the enclave . " the position of the eu is very clear , " ashton told a news conference .
" we want the opportunity for people to be able to move around freely or to see goods not only coming into gaza , but exports coming out of gaza . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's ashton 's second visit to gaza in four months ashton said the european union was willing to send monitors to help operate the crossings , but they would have to have a clear role and work with the western-backed palestinian authority , which hamas drove out of gaza in 2007 . " at the moment that is not something that is on the table , " she said . israel has agreed to relax its economic and political embargo on goods entering gaza by land .
the move comes after international outrage over an israeli raid on a gaza-bound aid flotilla in may , which left nine turkish activists dead . ashton conceded , however , that maritime access to gaza was unlikely in the near future . " at the moment , there is no proposal on the table to open a port , " she said .
" the best option seems to be , and that is the most supported by palestinians , to open the land crossings , and that 's what we 're working on . " the eu 's top diplomat said she 'd discuss the issue further in a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . call for more crossings european governments have urged israel to increase the number of crossing points and ease restrictions on the movement of people . israel says it now blocks only weapons and goods that could be put to military use . but the limited opening has drawn criticism from the palestinians and rights groups . " what we have today is 75 percent less -lsb- volume of traffic -rsb- than what we had in the first half of 2007 ...
that 's not what we are looking for , " fayyad told reporters .
" the economy of gaza can not be sustained only by importation , there needs to be exports . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants israel to ease restrictions on people crossing gaza 's borders ashton travelled to israel where she met with foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
she repeated her call for an end to the blockade , calling it " unacceptable , unsustainable and counter-productive . " for his part , lieberman said he had told ashton about israel 's " new , liberal approach to gaza " and called on the eu to support several large-scale infrastructure projects there " like power stations , desalination plants and water purification . " lieberman was pushing such projects as a prelude to israel , which supplies much of gaza 's utilities , cutting ties to the gaza strip , according to israeli media reports . gaza 's role in two state solution lieberman said israel was looking into the proposal but added that no official decisions had been made . ashton expressed her opposition to such a move . " i have consistently said the solution is a two state solution ... and gaza should be part of that , " she said .
" i made that position clear to foreign minister lieberman . " ashton was to meet with prime minister benjamin netanyahu later sunday .
she was not due to meet with officials from hamas , which is on us and eu lists of terrorist organizations . israel began the blockade of gaza in june 2006 after a soldier was captured by gaza militants and tightened restrictions a year later , when elections brought hamas to power . richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .
of germany 's 16 states , 10 are ruled by premiers from the cdu or its bavarian sister party the csu .
only one of the 10 , peter mueller of saarland , has long experience at the helm of a regional government . it seems only two cdu / csu figures are to remain in government who are widely considered as potential chancellors , both of them hailing from merkel 's cabinet : neither germany 's minister of labor and social affairs ursula von der leyen nor defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg have had executive experience at the local level running a german state or city-state . author : mark hallam , catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some key data remains under wraps . it 's one of the country 's worst-kept secrets . yet questions still surround the presence of former nazis and war criminals in west germany 's police , secret service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and politics . who were those people , what positions did they hold in nazi germany and later in post-war west germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany 's secret police collected information to blackmail or discredit its capitalist neighbor crucial information about the bnd 's past has long been hidden in the stasi files - the vast archive of information meticulously gathered by former communist east germany 's secret police , the stasi . the aim was to either blackmail western agents or to discredit its capitalist neighbor to the west . after reunification some of those documents were made available , but parts of the archives remained locked away for reasons of data privacy . continuity between nazis and west germany recently , the last remaining documents from the stasi files were released to the public . journalist andreas foerster had requested them as early as the year 2000 , but his request was turned down twice .
after persisting for years , he was finally granted access . foerster outlined how one policeman climbed through the nazi ranks and was ultimately employed after the war by west germany 's office for the protection of the constitution , the domestic security service . " in 1944 , he became an ss member and worked in the dachau concentration camp , " foerster said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the nazi documents indicate he did such a good job that he was transferred to auschwitz .
there , he worked in the so-called department for pest control - that 's where they ordered and received the cyclon b gas which was then used in the gas chambers of auschwitz . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one employee of west germany 's spy agency had worked at the auschwitz concentration camp the main task of west germany 's secret service after world war ii was to work against the soviet union , and when it came to recruiting staff , a nazi past was often overlooked if the recruit seemed capable of playing a useful role in the new struggle against communism . the nazi past of those cases was well known to their organizations , but it just did n't seem to matter , foerster said . much of the information being released in germany is already available in the united states .
the 1998 nazi war criminal disclosure act led to the cia releasing more than 700 files on germans with whom the us had worked in the aftermath of world war ii - even though they were known war criminals . reluctance to confront the past west germany 's intelligence service had a relatively high number of former nazis and war criminals in its ranks in its early years . " some 20 to 25 percent of the secret service were former ss men , " erich schmidt-eenboom , the head of a research institute that monitors intelligence services , told deutsche welle . " but if you broaden this to include the generals and officers in the regular armed forces , the wehrmacht , who 'd been involved in war crimes - then this may add up to 50 percent of the gehlen organization , which was initiated by the cia and was the immediate predecessor to the secret service , being made up of war criminals , " he added . the bnd itself was formed out of the gehlen organization , headed by legendary spymaster reinhard gehlen - a former german army general who worked as an intelligence officer on hitler 's eastern front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard gehlen - wehrmacht general turned west german intelligence chief over the years , the bnd has made several attempts to shed some light on its shady past .
between 1962 and 1965 , an internal inquiry looked into its members ' nazi links .
as a result , 70 people had to leave the secret service .
but they were only a fraction of the number who should have been sent packing , critics have said . the domestic intelligence service did a similar internal inquiry and also let a number of people go . " but these things were all only internal inquiries , " foerster said .
" that 's what these organizations still stand to answer for .
those who had to leave left quietly and , of course , still get their pension .
neither the bnd nor the domestic intelligence service have to this day openly dealt with their nazi roots " the stasi documents on the issue are now finally all open to research .
what remains classified are archives of the organizations themselves . in 2006 , the bnd said it would fund a research project into its own past , but little progress has been made .
the historian chosen for the project quit in 2008 over what he said was a lack of support for his work . author : andreas illmer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the parliamentarians have also called on the colombian government to give a full accounting of alleged illegal activity in europe of the department of administrative security -lrb- das -rrb- , the colombian agency charged with internal security . " the colombian government needs to clarify in what way the das acted against non-governmental or political organizations to influence and disqualify decisions made by the human rights commission for the european parliament , " lochbihler and hautala said in a statement on the eve of the eu 's signing of a free-trade agreement with colombia .
some parliamentarians believe that the eu is reluctant to publicly denounce the colombian intelligence operations because of colombia 's strategic importance as a western ally on venezuela 's border and its domestic fight against powerful drug traffickers .
eu officials fear that an investigation could torpedo ratification of the free-trade agreement , which they see as crucial support of colombia .
parliamentarians and victims of the das operation believe that belgium , which took over the eu presidency from spain on july 1 , may be more inclined to investigate the issue because much of the illicit colombian activity occurred in brussels and belgian citizens and residents - including european parliament green faction legal advisor paul-emile dupret , patricia verbauwhede of the belgian catholic charity broderlijk delen and luis-guillermo perez , the brussels-based secretary-general of the international federation for human rights - were targets of what das dubbed ' operation europe . ' the operation aimed to discredit entities and persons critical of colombia 's alleged abuse of human rights in its war on insurgents and drug traffickers through smear campaigns in the media and on the internet and the establishment of fake ngos in europe .
that 's according to colombian court documents and critics , including claudia julieta duque , a journalist who was forced to leave colombia because of her coverage of government cooperation with right-wing paramilitary groups .
' operation europe ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did outgoing president uribe know about the covert operations ?
the documents became public in legal proceedings in colombia against former das chief jorge noguera , who headed the 2002 election campaign of outgoing president alvaro uribe .
noguera is charged with overseeing the illegal wiretapping and surveillance in colombia of judges , politicians , journalists , trade unionists and ngo activists as well as das 's foreign operations .
the documents refer to operation europe as ' a legal war ' and describe das 's tactics as designed to neutralize " the destabilizing actions of ngos in colombia and the world . "
these tactics involved sowing controversy about and dissent within ngos and opposition groups and faking links between critics of the government and illegal armed groups .
they describe the fabrication of a guerrilla video featuring a colombian journalist and requests to cancel his visa for travel abroad as well as false allegations of corruption and adultery , death threats and blackmail of critics of the government .
alongside the european parliament and unhcr , das also allegedly targeted among others human rights watch , the washington office on latin america , the latin america working group , peace brigades international and belgian ngo oxfam solidarity .
human rights activist perez reported to belgian police last october the mysterious theft of three computers and a hard disk from his home in hoeilaart in belgium .
in a meeting with ngos in march in brussels , newly-appointed das chief felipe munoz declined a request by perez to see his das file .
an unidentified caller from colombia advised perez 's mother several weeks later , according to belgian daily le soir , that " the colombian president may be leaving -lrb- office -rrb- but we will always be here and we will always know how your children and their families conduct themselves . "
claims and counter-claims dupret , the european parliament legal advisor , said he first encountered problems when in 2004 a website published a falsified note under his name suggesting that he supported the revolutionary army of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , designated by the us and the eu as a terrorist organization .
the note contained excerpts of a private mail sent from his parliamentary email .
dupret denies ever having had contact with farc .
the note appeared shortly after he had been involved in a protest against a visit to brussels by uribe .
several months later , in transit at miami airport en route from caracas to europe as part of a parliamentary delegation , dupret was pulled aside by us officials and questioned for several hours about his ties to colombia and articles he had written .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the das says its operations were aimed at investigating farc 's influence in europe he has since been put on a us no-fly list .
us authorities in september 2009 forced an air france flight from paris to mexico to evade us air space because dupret was on board .
dupret and others targeted by operation europe have taken their case to court in brussels and are preparing to also file suit in bogota .
ecuadorian authorities are meanwhile investigating allegations of das wiretapping and interception of phone calls of senior ecuadorian officials , including president rafael correa .
colombia has denied the charges .
colombia 's foreign ministry has also denied the illegal das activity in europe .
" the information compiled by das , which is part of a file called ' europa , ' makes reference to data collected in 2004 and 2005 whose sources were published in the media and at public events .
the collection of this information did not involve any kind of irregularity in intelligence material , nor any violation of the rights of european citizens , " the ministry said in a statement .
colombian officials said the file was created to determine what influence farc may wield in europe .
government involvement ?
colombian prosecutors , however , charge that das 's wiretapping was sanctioned by senior government officials .
prosecutor misael rodriguez told a court hearing in april that the wiretapping " was directed from casa de narino , " the presidential palace .
in a report to the court , attorney general guillermo mendoza diago detailed discussions in april 2008 between senior officials in uribe 's office and das representatives about the illegal wiretapping operations . the us congress , in response to the charges , has prohibited us funding of das under the fiscal year 2010 foreign operations appropriations bill .
eu officials say an investigation could be counterproductive given colombian statements that das may be disbanded .
they also point to expected colombian parliament approval of a new law drafted by uribe that would reorganize das and put it under stricter supervision . the meps as well as the das 's european targets and colombian activists charge the draft law does not go far enough .
in a statement , the colombian commission of jurists , which according to the court documents was one of the ngo 's under das surveillance , said the law does not " establish adequate , effective and independent oversight of intelligence activities . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2010 hamburg mayor and merkel ally ole von beust steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust had led hamburg 's government since 2001 angela merkel 's government lost another powerful ally on sunday as hamburg mayor ole von beust said he would leave office as of august 25 .
two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust said the time had come for him to leave office leaving office alongside von beust are karin von welck , hamburg 's senator for culture , and volkmar schoen of the senate chancellery .
many in the cdu expect current christoph ahlhaus , who is currently the interior senator and seen as considerably more conservative than von beust , to take over as mayor at the end of august . von beust has been suffering form fatigue in his mayoral duties and has lost his appetite for politics altogether , aides have told german media . cross-party appeal charismatic speaker , often touted as merkel 's potential understudy , von beust helped the cdu reach new urban voter demographics that the traditionalist party had often ignored . the openly gay , centrist conservative conquered the traditionally left-leaning port city of hamburg for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in 2001 , after the party had spent 44 years in opposition .
he has retained the post ever since , and even ruled with an absolute majority - a rare occurrence under germany 's electoral system - between 2004 and 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust was sometimes seen as merkel 's protege von beust had been governing hamburg in coalition with the green party - the highest-profile alliance in the history of two parties considered at opposing ends of the political spectrum - and the city has been running relatively smoothly despite the right-left divide . von beust added that he did not have " the slightest doubt " that the cdu-greens coalition would be able to continue its work without him . as hamburg law calls for all of the city 's senators , who serve in positions similar to ministers in other german states , to be reconfirmed in office if the head of government steps down .
it remains to be seen if the rest of hamburg 's government will remain in office or if early elections will be held . one area of legislation where the parties have struggled is an adaptation to the city 's schooling system .
also on sunday , hamburg 's electorate is voting on a referendum over the proposal . thinning ranks merkel 's popularity has sunk to its lowest level since she was elected chancellor in 2005 , and an exodus of senior cdu politicians has hardly helped steady the ship as she walks the tightrope of trying to cement germany 's economic recovery while simultaneously cutting national public spending . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust governed with hamburg greens head christa goetsch von beust is the sixth christian democrat state premier to leave his post in the last 10 months .
although christian wulff quit his job in lower saxony to be promoted to the role of german president , he was replacing perhaps the highest profile cdu-affiliated deserter of all , former president horst koehler . the welt am sonntag newspaper said sunday that the number of experienced leaders in merkel 's party was dwindling . " it would not be entirely fair to give the chancellor all the blame for these departures , but at the same time she has to ask herself whether she has done enough for the top players on her team , " it said .
" the answer is no . " finance minister wolfgang schaeuble cast the changeover in the cdu in more positive light in an interview with the same paper . " in other countries it 's far more normal for political leaders to switch careers at some point , " he said .
" if there were n't any change , everyone would say : ' oh , those are always the same people and there 's no innovation . " ' the cdu remains the dominant party in german politics , despite its waning popularity .
of germany 's 16 states , 10 are ruled by premiers from the cdu or its bavarian sister party the csu .
only one of the 10 , peter mueller of saarland , has long experience at the helm of a regional government . it seems only two cdu / csu figures are to remain in government who are widely considered as potential chancellors , both of them hailing from merkel 's cabinet : neither germany 's minister of labor and social affairs ursula von der leyen nor defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg have had executive experience at the local level running a german state or city-state . author : mark hallam , catherine bolsover -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.07.2010 hamburg mayor and merkel ally ole von beust steps down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von beust had led hamburg 's government since 2001 angela merkel 's government lost another powerful ally on sunday as hamburg mayor ole von beust said he would leave office as of august 25 .
two other key hamburg politicians also announced they would leave their posts . the popular 55-year-old mayor of germany 's second largest city , a state in its own right , is a state premier in all but title .
he is the latest in a line of leading members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- to throw in the towel . " there 's a time for everything , " von beust told reporters in hamburg on sunday , listing the positions he has held in hamburg .
" this , naturally , applies to me as well . "
he said he had contacted merkel to tell her of his resignation and that she had been " understanding . " " we 've accomplished a lot for hamburg - the global economic crisis has left hamburg largely unscathed , " von beust said .
" i 'm sure the good work will continue even without me .
