while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 19.09.2010 berlin becomes international artists ' mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin attracts artists of all kinds from all over creative minds from all over the world are inexorably drawn to berlin .
a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .

a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 19.09.2010 berlin becomes international artists ' mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin attracts artists of all kinds from all over creative minds from all over the world are inexorably drawn to berlin .
a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.09.2010 merkel ally warns that threat of new far-right party is genuine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer and merkel both think practical action will help an ally of chancellor angela merkel says the emergence of a populist party to the right of the christian democrats is a real threat .
while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.09.2010 pope ends uk visit with beatification of 19th century cardinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict held an open-air mass in front of 55,000 people pope benedict xvi has beatified cardinal john henry newman at an open-air mass in birmingham .
he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 19.09.2010 berlin becomes international artists ' mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin attracts artists of all kinds from all over creative minds from all over the world are inexorably drawn to berlin .
a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .

a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .

a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 19.09.2010 berlin becomes international artists ' mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin attracts artists of all kinds from all over creative minds from all over the world are inexorably drawn to berlin .
a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .

and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

medicinal licences for herbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyssopus officinalis is a herb used to treat respiratory disorders those working in the sector have for a long time been campaigning for regulation and greater control , but the new authorization and licensing requirements have enormous implications for the herbal medicine industry throughout the european union .
marinella trovato , president of s.i.s.t.e. , the italian society for herbal science and technology in milan , said there is great concern about market ramifications . " a lot of companies are worried about the possibility that in the future they can not use a lot of plants for food application . "
many small producers and manufacturers of medicinal herbs will no longer be able to afford to do so , unable to cover the cost of authorization licences for medicinal herbs , trovato added .
uk-trained herbalist , marco valussi , speaking at the conference , warned that the terms of the directive would put herbal remedy manufacture in the hands of large pharmaceutical companies , and this was likely to narrow the range of medicinal herbs on the market .
not all the medicinal plants are , economically speaking , interesting for the big companies , " said marco valussi , who works in italy as a consultant in the field of medicinal plants and vegetable-based products .
" these companies might decide to focus on maybe five or ten important herbs and leave behind the other ones .
so the consumer could have a reduced range of choices . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturers will need an expensive medical licence loss of business in italy , the profession of the herbal practitioner who can treat patients is not legally recognized and herbalists are only qualified to make and sell their products in shops called erboristerie , the equivalent of health food stores in the uk and reformhäuser or bioläden in germany .
but the new classification will signify a huge loss of business as these stores will no longer be able to sell many of their most popular products , such as passiflora , ginseng and valerian , which will only be available in pharmacies .
marco valussi showed concern that some of the less common herbal remedies may disappear completely from the european market .
" obviously , we all want the best quality and lowest risk possible for consumers , but we also want the consumer to have the possibility to use plants . "
he added that the directive will also put consumers at an economic disadvantage .
" buying at the pharmacy usually means that you pay much more than if you buy at the erboristeria . "
uk herbal practitioners at risk michael mcintyre , a professor of herbal medicine at the university of middlesex and chairman of the european herbal practitioners association , said in the uk , where herbal practitioners are allowed to treat patients directly , the implications for their sector are equally worrying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcintyre is worried herbal practitioners will lose access to a large range of medicines as a practitioner , he said , he will likely lose access to a large range of medicines that are made up for him currently by manufacturers to his order for individual patients .
" my patients are already very alarmed when i tell them that this medicine that you 've been taking which is doing you so much good is not going to be available next year . "
many commonly used ayurvedic , chinese and tibetan herbal mixes , which are perhaps not medically recognized in the eu , will no longer be legally available .
the directive aims to safeguard consumers and ensure the quality of commercialized herbal products , but michael mcintyre believes it will , ironically , have the opposite effect : " patients or the public who want to use herbal medicines will be forced to go onto the internet and buy from unsafe sources , or indeed visit backstreet bogus practitioners who have n't got proper training . "
statutory regulation michael mcintyre is campaigning for statutory regulation of herbal practitioners in the uk , and for herbalists to be given a new pan-european professional status as certified healthcare professionals .
according to government surveys , he said , a quarter of the uk population had actually used herbal medicines in the last two years .
" it 's important that they know that the people that they are going to see are properly trained and accountable , and that 's what regulation will do . "
as a practitioner with decades of experience , michael mcintyre believes it is a measure which not only makes sense for the herbal industry and consumers , but also for the eu 's public health services .
safe , gentle herbal remedies can be used to treat numerous conditions from irritable bowel syndrome to headaches and insomnia , avoiding the need for prescription medications .
" drugs are costing huge sums of money and the governments really ca n't afford this , " michael mcintyre said , " i really believe that herbal medicine could go a long way to saving the health budgets of all the eu member states . "

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.09.2010 merkel ally warns that threat of new far-right party is genuine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer and merkel both think practical action will help an ally of chancellor angela merkel says the emergence of a populist party to the right of the christian democrats is a real threat .
while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.09.2010 pope ends uk visit with beatification of 19th century cardinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict held an open-air mass in front of 55,000 people pope benedict xvi has beatified cardinal john henry newman at an open-air mass in birmingham .
he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

the far-right party sweden democrats has won its first seats . swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt and his four-party " alliance " coalition have won 49.2 percent of the vote , compared with 43.7 percent for the center-left opposition bloc .
" we intend to continue to govern , " reinfeldt told his supporters .
the far-right party sweden democrats took 5.7 percent of the vote , having cleared the 4 percent hurdle needed to enter parliament .
the anti-immigration party 's success has deprived the ruling coalition of a majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have already been massive protests against the sweden democrats the center-left social democratic leader mona sahlin was vying to become sweden 's first female prime minister , but her coalition with the greens and left party was significantly beaten .
reinfeldt 's moderate party is the largest in the ruling coalition , which also includes the liberal party , the center party and the christian democrats .
increase in support for far-right party growing support for the anti-immigrant sweden democrats mirrors developments in countries like denmark , the netherlands and france , where anti-immigrant parties are already strong .
fredrik furtenbach , the head of the politics desk at swedish national radio , told deutsche welle that the party was sweden 's least popular party .
but he warned that it was the only one that was campaigning on accepting fewer refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aakesson stirred up swedes on saturday with his ' 99 proposals ' " so they have potential , " furtenbach said .
" there is a group of swedish voters that want fewer refugees , and the sweden democrats are the only alternative for them . "
sweden democrats leader jimmie aakesson attempted to present the party 's " 99 proposals " in front of parliament in stockholm on saturday to highlight the way the main parties have ostracized it .
far-right threat overshadows election " we want those who will be our colleagues starting next week to know what to expect from us and what issues we expect to push , " he said , after being prevented from posting the scroll of proposals to parliament meant to evoke martin luther 's nailing of the 95 theses to the door of the wittenberg cathedral , launching the reformation .
both reinfeldt and sahlin , meanwhile , have dismissed the notion of entering into government with the sweden democrats , saying the party 's anti-immigration campaign opposes sweden 's constitution .

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .

the far-right party sweden democrats has won its first seats . swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt and his four-party " alliance " coalition have won 49.2 percent of the vote , compared with 43.7 percent for the center-left opposition bloc .
" we intend to continue to govern , " reinfeldt told his supporters .
the far-right party sweden democrats took 5.7 percent of the vote , having cleared the 4 percent hurdle needed to enter parliament .
the anti-immigration party 's success has deprived the ruling coalition of a majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have already been massive protests against the sweden democrats the center-left social democratic leader mona sahlin was vying to become sweden 's first female prime minister , but her coalition with the greens and left party was significantly beaten .
reinfeldt 's moderate party is the largest in the ruling coalition , which also includes the liberal party , the center party and the christian democrats .
increase in support for far-right party growing support for the anti-immigrant sweden democrats mirrors developments in countries like denmark , the netherlands and france , where anti-immigrant parties are already strong .
fredrik furtenbach , the head of the politics desk at swedish national radio , told deutsche welle that the party was sweden 's least popular party .
but he warned that it was the only one that was campaigning on accepting fewer refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aakesson stirred up swedes on saturday with his ' 99 proposals ' " so they have potential , " furtenbach said .
" there is a group of swedish voters that want fewer refugees , and the sweden democrats are the only alternative for them . "
sweden democrats leader jimmie aakesson attempted to present the party 's " 99 proposals " in front of parliament in stockholm on saturday to highlight the way the main parties have ostracized it .
far-right threat overshadows election " we want those who will be our colleagues starting next week to know what to expect from us and what issues we expect to push , " he said , after being prevented from posting the scroll of proposals to parliament meant to evoke martin luther 's nailing of the 95 theses to the door of the wittenberg cathedral , launching the reformation .
both reinfeldt and sahlin , meanwhile , have dismissed the notion of entering into government with the sweden democrats , saying the party 's anti-immigration campaign opposes sweden 's constitution .

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

from april 2011 , all member states will have to comply with a european union directive which specifies that all herbs produced , manufactured and sold in the eu must be classified as either foods or medicines .
medicinal licences for herbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyssopus officinalis is a herb used to treat respiratory disorders those working in the sector have for a long time been campaigning for regulation and greater control , but the new authorization and licensing requirements have enormous implications for the herbal medicine industry throughout the european union .
marinella trovato , president of s.i.s.t.e. , the italian society for herbal science and technology in milan , said there is great concern about market ramifications . " a lot of companies are worried about the possibility that in the future they can not use a lot of plants for food application . "
many small producers and manufacturers of medicinal herbs will no longer be able to afford to do so , unable to cover the cost of authorization licences for medicinal herbs , trovato added .
uk-trained herbalist , marco valussi , speaking at the conference , warned that the terms of the directive would put herbal remedy manufacture in the hands of large pharmaceutical companies , and this was likely to narrow the range of medicinal herbs on the market .
not all the medicinal plants are , economically speaking , interesting for the big companies , " said marco valussi , who works in italy as a consultant in the field of medicinal plants and vegetable-based products .
" these companies might decide to focus on maybe five or ten important herbs and leave behind the other ones .
so the consumer could have a reduced range of choices . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturers will need an expensive medical licence loss of business in italy , the profession of the herbal practitioner who can treat patients is not legally recognized and herbalists are only qualified to make and sell their products in shops called erboristerie , the equivalent of health food stores in the uk and reformhäuser or bioläden in germany .
but the new classification will signify a huge loss of business as these stores will no longer be able to sell many of their most popular products , such as passiflora , ginseng and valerian , which will only be available in pharmacies .
marco valussi showed concern that some of the less common herbal remedies may disappear completely from the european market .
" obviously , we all want the best quality and lowest risk possible for consumers , but we also want the consumer to have the possibility to use plants . "
he added that the directive will also put consumers at an economic disadvantage .
" buying at the pharmacy usually means that you pay much more than if you buy at the erboristeria . "
uk herbal practitioners at risk michael mcintyre , a professor of herbal medicine at the university of middlesex and chairman of the european herbal practitioners association , said in the uk , where herbal practitioners are allowed to treat patients directly , the implications for their sector are equally worrying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcintyre is worried herbal practitioners will lose access to a large range of medicines as a practitioner , he said , he will likely lose access to a large range of medicines that are made up for him currently by manufacturers to his order for individual patients .
" my patients are already very alarmed when i tell them that this medicine that you 've been taking which is doing you so much good is not going to be available next year . "
many commonly used ayurvedic , chinese and tibetan herbal mixes , which are perhaps not medically recognized in the eu , will no longer be legally available .
the directive aims to safeguard consumers and ensure the quality of commercialized herbal products , but michael mcintyre believes it will , ironically , have the opposite effect : " patients or the public who want to use herbal medicines will be forced to go onto the internet and buy from unsafe sources , or indeed visit backstreet bogus practitioners who have n't got proper training . "
statutory regulation michael mcintyre is campaigning for statutory regulation of herbal practitioners in the uk , and for herbalists to be given a new pan-european professional status as certified healthcare professionals .
according to government surveys , he said , a quarter of the uk population had actually used herbal medicines in the last two years .
" it 's important that they know that the people that they are going to see are properly trained and accountable , and that 's what regulation will do . "
as a practitioner with decades of experience , michael mcintyre believes it is a measure which not only makes sense for the herbal industry and consumers , but also for the eu 's public health services .
safe , gentle herbal remedies can be used to treat numerous conditions from irritable bowel syndrome to headaches and insomnia , avoiding the need for prescription medications .
" drugs are costing huge sums of money and the governments really ca n't afford this , " michael mcintyre said , " i really believe that herbal medicine could go a long way to saving the health budgets of all the eu member states . "

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .

" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.09.2010 pope ends uk visit with beatification of 19th century cardinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict held an open-air mass in front of 55,000 people pope benedict xvi has beatified cardinal john henry newman at an open-air mass in birmingham .
he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

the message came two weeks after eta announced a ceasefire . spain 's government on monday rejected a call by banned basque separatist group eta for international mediation to resolve decades of violent discord .
spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega dismissed the call monday , saying the government had " no comment to make about something that has nothing new . "
" eta knows that the only thing that has any value is the definitive and complete end to violence and arms , " she added .
in a statement published in the basque newspaper gara , the eta said that it was willing to " explore " the steps required for a democratic process , " including commitments to be taken by eta . "
the separatist organization had said it was ready to consider a declaration drawn up in brussels in march , calling on eta to announce a permanent , unconditional and internationally verifiable ceasefire .
the declaration was signed by , among others , anglican bishop , desmond tutu , and former president of south africa , frederik willem de klerk , as well as four nobel peace laureates .
the spanish government had already dismissed the eta ceasefire declaration of september 5 , which gave no details of precise plans .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said , " statements are worth nothing , only decisions matter . "
since the start of its violent campaign for an independent basque country in the late 1960s , eta has killed more than 825 people .
the group previously announced a " permanent ceasefire " in 2006 , but it ended with a car bomb that killed two people at madrid 's main airport later that year .

the message came two weeks after eta announced a ceasefire . spain 's government on monday rejected a call by banned basque separatist group eta for international mediation to resolve decades of violent discord .
spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega dismissed the call monday , saying the government had " no comment to make about something that has nothing new . "
" eta knows that the only thing that has any value is the definitive and complete end to violence and arms , " she added .
in a statement published in the basque newspaper gara , the eta said that it was willing to " explore " the steps required for a democratic process , " including commitments to be taken by eta . "
the separatist organization had said it was ready to consider a declaration drawn up in brussels in march , calling on eta to announce a permanent , unconditional and internationally verifiable ceasefire .
the declaration was signed by , among others , anglican bishop , desmond tutu , and former president of south africa , frederik willem de klerk , as well as four nobel peace laureates .
the spanish government had already dismissed the eta ceasefire declaration of september 5 , which gave no details of precise plans .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said , " statements are worth nothing , only decisions matter . "
since the start of its violent campaign for an independent basque country in the late 1960s , eta has killed more than 825 people .
the group previously announced a " permanent ceasefire " in 2006 , but it ended with a car bomb that killed two people at madrid 's main airport later that year .

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.09.2010 sweden 's ruling coalition beats opposition but fails to gain majority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent fredrik reinfeldt and challenger mona sahlins sweden 's election has produced a hung parliament , with the center-right coalition winning but missing out on a majority .
the far-right party sweden democrats has won its first seats . swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt and his four-party " alliance " coalition have won 49.2 percent of the vote , compared with 43.7 percent for the center-left opposition bloc .
" we intend to continue to govern , " reinfeldt told his supporters .
the far-right party sweden democrats took 5.7 percent of the vote , having cleared the 4 percent hurdle needed to enter parliament .
the anti-immigration party 's success has deprived the ruling coalition of a majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have already been massive protests against the sweden democrats the center-left social democratic leader mona sahlin was vying to become sweden 's first female prime minister , but her coalition with the greens and left party was significantly beaten .
reinfeldt 's moderate party is the largest in the ruling coalition , which also includes the liberal party , the center party and the christian democrats .
increase in support for far-right party growing support for the anti-immigrant sweden democrats mirrors developments in countries like denmark , the netherlands and france , where anti-immigrant parties are already strong .
fredrik furtenbach , the head of the politics desk at swedish national radio , told deutsche welle that the party was sweden 's least popular party .
but he warned that it was the only one that was campaigning on accepting fewer refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aakesson stirred up swedes on saturday with his ' 99 proposals ' " so they have potential , " furtenbach said .
" there is a group of swedish voters that want fewer refugees , and the sweden democrats are the only alternative for them . "
sweden democrats leader jimmie aakesson attempted to present the party 's " 99 proposals " in front of parliament in stockholm on saturday to highlight the way the main parties have ostracized it .

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 19.09.2010 berlin becomes international artists ' mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin attracts artists of all kinds from all over creative minds from all over the world are inexorably drawn to berlin .
a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .
you 're as likely to hear spanish or english on the street these days as you are german or turkish . "
' wow ' factor but it 's not just the international flair that sage likes about the city : " i think it 's still its history that gives berlin that ' wow ' factor . "
the way berliners deal with this history impresses him , as do their passionate architectural debates about buildings such as the historic berlin city palace or the old east german palace of the republic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace of the republic was demolished several years ago " i 'm fascinated by the discussions people have here about what should be constructed or knocked down , " he says .
" as an artist , architecture is obviously very important to me : what do the streets look like , what 's the shape of the sky you live under ?
when i think about painting in the light you get here in this city … it 's fantastic ! "
there 's still plenty of room for artists under the berlin sky .
and if the scene in neukoelln is now established to the extent that it has lost some of its fresh , improvised charm , something new is sure to develop elsewhere in the city .
berlin is big enough ; the energy here is always on the move from one quarter to another .
stagnation is almost unthinkable , agrees pernille koldbech fich , who 's planning to set up her camera here for quite a while .
" berlin is constantly changing , " she says .
" the only other place i know that moves this fast is new york .
but berlin feels cozy too ; it 's quiet and relaxed at the same time .
there 's not much stress , and yet there 's a lot of energy .
it 's a really special combination . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 19.09.2010 berlin becomes international artists ' mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin attracts artists of all kinds from all over creative minds from all over the world are inexorably drawn to berlin .
a young , vibrant , international arts scene now characterizes certain quarters of the city , and the boom shows no sign of ending . pernille koldbech fich does n't really have time for an interview .
the danish photographer is in the middle of moving .
her residency at kuenstlerhaus bethanien , an institution that hosts international artists and provides them with grants , has just come to end .
berlin has given koldbech fich new inspiration for her work , and she 's decided to stay on ; so today her large format photographs , mysteriously illuminated portraits set against dark backgrounds , are being packed and transported to her new studio .
koldbech fich finds it easier to photograph people here than in copenhagen .
it 's one of the main reasons why she wants to stay .
" there are so many different kinds of people here , " she says .
" i think it has to do with the history ; there are so many people here from eastern europe .
you can see that they do n't all come from the same region .
back home everybody looks the same . "
she thinks she can even tell - still , 20 years after german unification - whether someone is from east or west berlin .
she is n't quite sure ; but perhaps it 's not a coincidence that when she finds people she wants to photograph for her introverted portraits they always turn out to come from the east .
secret capital of denmark pernille is one of a strikingly large number of danes who have moved to berlin .
according to estimates in danish newspapers , one-third of her country 's artists now live and work here .
some call berlin denmark 's secret capital .
olafur eliasson , denmark 's most famous artist , is based here , and hundreds of other world-class artists have decided to settle in the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olafur eliasson is one of many scandinavians who have settled in berlin the dynamism in the art scene following the fall of the wall created a " berlin hype " that is still attracting people today .
berlin-mitte , in the former east , has a burgeoning and internationally respected gallery scene , as does the western district of kreuzberg .
unified berlin has long since replaced cologne as the art capital of germany .
at the last documenta - the epitome of the international art exhibition , staged in kassel every five years - half the works on display were by berlin-based artists .
all this enhances the city 's reputation as a center for artistic endeavor .
however , everyday life in berlin is characterized by all kinds of artists of lesser renown - in particular young , creative types from other countries , who are flocking to the city and have begun to change the face of entire quarters .
neukoelln is a perfect example of this .
until recently the area was regarded as one of the most problematic in the capital , with high unemployment , a large proportion of migrants and gangs of violent youths .
the inhabitants of neukoelln were mostly either underprivileged or people who were not easily shocked and enjoyed exposing themselves to the rough charm of the area .
a few years ago the neighborhood was characterized by fighting dogs on the streets and men in tracksuits shuffling to run-down corner pubs .
now , some of these pubs are metamorphosing into artists ' hangouts .
painters and poets new to the neighborhood sip their beer alongside long-term residents .
every week new cafes and bars , galleries , studios and little creative businesses open .
the cultural scene in neukoelln has become one of the liveliest in the city .
good energy " i feel so free here - there are lots of opportunities to do things , " says guillaume airiaud , who comes from france .
" berlin just has a good energy .
it 's cool . "
airiaud is currently showing his sculptures in an exhibition in neukoelln .
he has n't sold many yet , but he 's optimistic .
he 's only 26 and not under any pressure .
he came to berlin three years ago with the erasmus european student exchange program and liked the city so much that he decided to stay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in summer , berlin life moves to the streets he and some other artists set themselves up as " studio 54 " in an atelier in neukoelln , and they 've managed to create a small network , organizing joint exhibitions .
as a franco-german-italian-english-iraqi team they are able to make more connections together than each could manage on his or her own .
christopher sage is another of the artists working at studio 54 .
at the back of the atelier building , where he has found just the right light for his work , he paints unsettling , apparently multi-dimensional interiors .
sage grew up in london in a cosmopolitan environment .
his parents always had foreign students staying in the house , so sage 's perspective on life was always a broad one .
this is something he also appreciates about berlin .
he came here seven years ago , off his own bat rather than through an institution , and made a life for himself in the city .
since then he has seen how neukoelln has changed .
" in the past three or four years especially a huge number of artists have been coming here from abroad .

the far-right party sweden democrats has won its first seats . swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt and his four-party " alliance " coalition have won 49.2 percent of the vote , compared with 43.7 percent for the center-left opposition bloc .
" we intend to continue to govern , " reinfeldt told his supporters .
the far-right party sweden democrats took 5.7 percent of the vote , having cleared the 4 percent hurdle needed to enter parliament .

reinfeldt 's moderate party is the largest in the ruling coalition , which also includes the liberal party , the center party and the christian democrats .

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

while merkel is less worried , she has similar ideas about quashing any such danger . an ally of chancellor angela merkel has warned that her christian democrat cdu could face a challenge if a new party were to emerge on the right . in response to fears that the party could face a challenge on its right flank , wolfgang boehmer - who is cdu premier of the state of saxony anhalt - warned against complacency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boehmer said the party had to be constantly on guard " the danger that a populist right-wing party might emerge always exists , " said boehmer in the german daily newspaper hamburger abendblatt on saturday . " even if at the moment we can not recognize who could lead it .
we must always be on our guard and undertake everything to avoid the founding of another party to the right of our own . "
when asked if the party was adhering sufficiently to its conservative roots , boehmer said that constant vigilance was necessary .
" we have to repeatedly pose the question of whether conservatives identify with the cdu , " he said .
as a mainstream party , said the premier , it was not possible for the cdu to move too far to the right .
instead , he said , the problems that were important to ordinary people should be clearly addressed .
" that is the best immunization against far right extremist attitudes , " said boehmer .
chancellor takes threat in stride playing down the threat , merkel told the sueddeutsche zeitung on saturday that she did not believe there was a real danger .
the chancellor said that it was the responsibility of " democratic parties , to prevent the foundation of new parties on the extreme right as well as the left through our politics . "
while merkel was not as concerned as boehmer , her ideas about how to head off any potential threat was similar .
the chancellor said practical solutions to genuine grievances and concerns were the answer . " we should do more than define what the grievances are , we have to solve the problems , " said merkel .
" then we will not need to worry about new parties on the fringe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen said the party needed to host more open debate merkel added that she would endeavor to make sure the views of conservatives were represented within the party .
state of debate ' depressing ' environment minister norbert roettgen said that he believed that the party needed to be more open to debate , saying that its present state was " depressing . "
" we must once again make the party a place for discussion and opinion-forming , " he told the website of german news magazine spiegel on saturday .
suggestions that a party to the right of the cdu would attract popular support were made by party conservative erika steinbach , who is to stand down from her post on the party 's national executive board .
steinbach , head of the german federation of expellees , announced her resignation from the board after making comments about poland 's part in the build up to world war ii earlier this month .
the politician , whose federation represents ethnic germans who were forced to flee eastern europe at the end of the war , was accused of historical revisionism and said she felt increasingly isolated on the party 's right .

politicians are outraged . after the german government shelled out massive sums to help hre fend off financial doom , politicians have lashed out at the bank after it emerged that some 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.6 million -rrb- were paid in bonuses to executives in 2009 .
a bank spokesman was quoted on sunday as defending the bonuses as " merely a fragment " of the amounts given to its employees prior to the crisis .
the spokesman added that " no bonuses larger than 500,000 euro were handed out , " which goes against reports made by german magazine der spiegel .
the magazine had claimed that some of the executives received payments of over one million euros .
the german government took over hypo real estate after the bank nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis in 2008 , booking losses well over two billion euros .
just last week it became apparent that the lender will need another 40 billion euros in state guarantees , bringing the total government contribution to almost 150 billion euros .
tax payers made to bleed for ' zombie bank ' politicians , meanwhile , have reacted with outrage to hre 's announcement and defense of the bonus payments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is shelling out for a ' zombie bank ' say experts frank schaeffler , a financial expert of the joint-governing free democrats , told the online edition of the daily handelsblatt that it was " unfathomable " that the payments were being made , directing his criticism just as much at the social democrat-christian democrat coalition which was governing when hre was rescued .
" the resurrection of this ' zombie bank ' should have been managed differently .
it is inconceivable that the government did n't ask for such bonus payments to be prohibited as a condition of its bailout , " schaeffler said .
handelsblatt also cited gerhard schick , the greens party 's financial spokesman , as calling bonus payments for 2009 , the year hre received the billions in state aid , " outrageous . "
" it is absolutely unacceptable to expect tax payers to shell out millions for banker bonuses , " shick said , adding that " nobody will tolerate such reckless behavior at the expense of the general public . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

he also marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain with a personal reflection on the " evil ideology " of nazism . the beatification of cardinal john henry newman , a 19th century theologian and convert from the anglican church to catholicism has been described by the vatican as a " positive moment " for relations between the two churches .
the ceremony conducted by the pope in england 's second largest city , birmingham , brings newman a step closer to sainthood .
it is the first beatification of pope benedict 's papacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal john henry newman converted to catholicism in 1845 newman 's life spanned most of the 19th century , dying in 1890 at the age of 89 .
he was originally baptized and ordained in the church of england , but was received into the roman catholic church in 1845 .
newman was one of the leading thinkers of his day and believed that christianity should unite dogma and experience , and heart and mind .
his writings are said to have had a profound influence on pope benedict .
the path to newman 's beatification was cleared last year when the vatican said that a us deacon 's agonizing spinal disorder was cured through his prayers to newman .
recognition of britain 's fight against nazism speaking at the open-air ceremony in birmingham attended by 55,000 people , the pope also paid a personal tribute to britain 's role in resisting germany 's nazi regime during world war ii .
" for me as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the nazi regime in germany , it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion , and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives , courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology . "
the head of the roman catholic church grew up in bavaria in southern germany and , like other germans of his generation , served in the hitler youth movement from the age of 14 .
britain is currently commemorating the 70th anniversary of the battle of britain , the royal air force 's crucial air victory in september 1940 .
" my thoughts go in particular to nearby coventry , " the pope said , " which suffered heavy bombardment and massive loss of life in november 1940 . "
coventry , in the west midlands , like the heavily-bombed city of dresden in germany , has become a symbol for the futility of destruction during the second world war .
rounding off four-day visit the beatification mass rounds off the pope 's four-day visit to glasgow , edinburgh , london and birmingham .
the pope returns to rome later on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights campaigners held an anti-pope protest in london during the visit the pope spoke out about what he called the spread of " aggressive secularism " in britain .
prime minister david cameron thanked him for making the country " sit up and think " by asking such " searching questions . "
commentators say the trip has helped ease tension with anglicans in britain .
but the pope also faced protests against the way the church has handled sexual abuse allegations against catholic priests .
campaigners criticized the catholic church 's stance on homosexuality , women priests and contraception .
pope benedict expressed remorse over the issue of pedophile priests , and met with five victims of sexual abuse by the clergy .
he expressed his " shame " and " deep sorrow " for their suffering .
the vatican on sunday called pope benedict xvi 's visit to britain a " spiritual success . "

the far-right party sweden democrats has won its first seats . swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt and his four-party " alliance " coalition have won 49.2 percent of the vote , compared with 43.7 percent for the center-left opposition bloc .
" we intend to continue to govern , " reinfeldt told his supporters .
the far-right party sweden democrats took 5.7 percent of the vote , having cleared the 4 percent hurdle needed to enter parliament .
the anti-immigration party 's success has deprived the ruling coalition of a majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have already been massive protests against the sweden democrats the center-left social democratic leader mona sahlin was vying to become sweden 's first female prime minister , but her coalition with the greens and left party was significantly beaten .
reinfeldt 's moderate party is the largest in the ruling coalition , which also includes the liberal party , the center party and the christian democrats .
increase in support for far-right party growing support for the anti-immigrant sweden democrats mirrors developments in countries like denmark , the netherlands and france , where anti-immigrant parties are already strong .
fredrik furtenbach , the head of the politics desk at swedish national radio , told deutsche welle that the party was sweden 's least popular party .
but he warned that it was the only one that was campaigning on accepting fewer refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aakesson stirred up swedes on saturday with his ' 99 proposals ' " so they have potential , " furtenbach said .
" there is a group of swedish voters that want fewer refugees , and the sweden democrats are the only alternative for them . "
sweden democrats leader jimmie aakesson attempted to present the party 's " 99 proposals " in front of parliament in stockholm on saturday to highlight the way the main parties have ostracized it .
far-right threat overshadows election " we want those who will be our colleagues starting next week to know what to expect from us and what issues we expect to push , " he said , after being prevented from posting the scroll of proposals to parliament meant to evoke martin luther 's nailing of the 95 theses to the door of the wittenberg cathedral , launching the reformation .
both reinfeldt and sahlin , meanwhile , have dismissed the notion of entering into government with the sweden democrats , saying the party 's anti-immigration campaign opposes sweden 's constitution .

from april 2011 , all member states will have to comply with a european union directive which specifies that all herbs produced , manufactured and sold in the eu must be classified as either foods or medicines .
medicinal licences for herbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyssopus officinalis is a herb used to treat respiratory disorders those working in the sector have for a long time been campaigning for regulation and greater control , but the new authorization and licensing requirements have enormous implications for the herbal medicine industry throughout the european union .
marinella trovato , president of s.i.s.t.e. , the italian society for herbal science and technology in milan , said there is great concern about market ramifications . " a lot of companies are worried about the possibility that in the future they can not use a lot of plants for food application . "
many small producers and manufacturers of medicinal herbs will no longer be able to afford to do so , unable to cover the cost of authorization licences for medicinal herbs , trovato added .
uk-trained herbalist , marco valussi , speaking at the conference , warned that the terms of the directive would put herbal remedy manufacture in the hands of large pharmaceutical companies , and this was likely to narrow the range of medicinal herbs on the market .
not all the medicinal plants are , economically speaking , interesting for the big companies , " said marco valussi , who works in italy as a consultant in the field of medicinal plants and vegetable-based products .
" these companies might decide to focus on maybe five or ten important herbs and leave behind the other ones .
so the consumer could have a reduced range of choices . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manufacturers will need an expensive medical licence loss of business in italy , the profession of the herbal practitioner who can treat patients is not legally recognized and herbalists are only qualified to make and sell their products in shops called erboristerie , the equivalent of health food stores in the uk and reformhäuser or bioläden in germany .
but the new classification will signify a huge loss of business as these stores will no longer be able to sell many of their most popular products , such as passiflora , ginseng and valerian , which will only be available in pharmacies .
marco valussi showed concern that some of the less common herbal remedies may disappear completely from the european market .
" obviously , we all want the best quality and lowest risk possible for consumers , but we also want the consumer to have the possibility to use plants . "
he added that the directive will also put consumers at an economic disadvantage .
" buying at the pharmacy usually means that you pay much more than if you buy at the erboristeria . "
uk herbal practitioners at risk michael mcintyre , a professor of herbal medicine at the university of middlesex and chairman of the european herbal practitioners association , said in the uk , where herbal practitioners are allowed to treat patients directly , the implications for their sector are equally worrying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcintyre is worried herbal practitioners will lose access to a large range of medicines as a practitioner , he said , he will likely lose access to a large range of medicines that are made up for him currently by manufacturers to his order for individual patients .
" my patients are already very alarmed when i tell them that this medicine that you 've been taking which is doing you so much good is not going to be available next year . "
many commonly used ayurvedic , chinese and tibetan herbal mixes , which are perhaps not medically recognized in the eu , will no longer be legally available .
the directive aims to safeguard consumers and ensure the quality of commercialized herbal products , but michael mcintyre believes it will , ironically , have the opposite effect : " patients or the public who want to use herbal medicines will be forced to go onto the internet and buy from unsafe sources , or indeed visit backstreet bogus practitioners who have n't got proper training . "
statutory regulation michael mcintyre is campaigning for statutory regulation of herbal practitioners in the uk , and for herbalists to be given a new pan-european professional status as certified healthcare professionals .
according to government surveys , he said , a quarter of the uk population had actually used herbal medicines in the last two years .
" it 's important that they know that the people that they are going to see are properly trained and accountable , and that 's what regulation will do . "
as a practitioner with decades of experience , michael mcintyre believes it is a measure which not only makes sense for the herbal industry and consumers , but also for the eu 's public health services .
safe , gentle herbal remedies can be used to treat numerous conditions from irritable bowel syndrome to headaches and insomnia , avoiding the need for prescription medications .
" drugs are costing huge sums of money and the governments really ca n't afford this , " michael mcintyre said , " i really believe that herbal medicine could go a long way to saving the health budgets of all the eu member states . "
