twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .
for the first time in history , germany was united , free , and at peace with its neighbors .
unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .
for the first time in history , germany was united , free , and at peace with its neighbors .
unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

" we have passed a historic threshold on the way to advanced democracy and the supremacy of law , " he said at a press conference in istanbul . german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the result and said he was confident that turkey would make further progress .

the reforms would also lead to changes in the supreme board of judges and prosecutors . kemal kilicdaroglu , the leader of the center-left republican people 's party , said the proposed measures would put critics of the government in danger .

" a raft of implementation laws will be necessary and we will observe developments closely . " erdogan is eager to bring turkey more in line with european norms and distance it from its current constitution , which was established in 1982 after a coup d 'etat . supporters say the amendments will improve the state of turkey 's democracy and the fundamental rights of individuals , steps the eu has long called on turkey to take . " in normal times people say that they are against the coup and the constitution of the coup , so they now have chance to change it , " erdogan said , asking , " how can any one against the coup oppose these reforms ? " opposition fears for turkey 's secularism yet the country 's two main opposition parties - from both the right and left of the political spectrum - campaigned against the proposed judicial reforms in the package of 26 new or revised amendments . opposition leaders claimed that turkey 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , marked by its islamic roots , would use the reforms to seize control of the judiciary , thus undermining turkey 's secular state . the proposed judicial reforms included a bid to increase the number of constitutional court judges from 11 to 17 , giving parliament great power to select the new appointees .
the reforms would also lead to changes in the supreme board of judges and prosecutors . kemal kilicdaroglu , the leader of the center-left republican people 's party , said the proposed measures would put critics of the government in danger . " my call is to all the business people , all the artists and intellectuals , " he said .
" if ' yes ' comes out of the referendum , one morning your home can be raided , you can be taken into custody , and spend months in prison . " a society divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents fear the government will arrest more secular " enemies " opponents have said the government already enjoys a massive majority in parliament , adding that passing the reforms would mean lifting one of the last checks on government power .
they have also criticized the move to have voters decide on the entire package of reforms rather than on individual amendments . erdogan declared at the outset of the referendum process his hope that the reform package could unite the country by severing ties with its legacy of military rule .
but instead , the referendum appears to have further deepened the division within turkish society . " on secularism and conservatism , it is divided between half and half , " said political columnist nuray mert .
" on the definition of secularism and definition of democracy , people have strongly different opinions from each other and the gap between the two camps is widening each day .

twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .

" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .

twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .
for the first time in history , germany was united , free , and at peace with its neighbors .
unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .
for the first time in history , germany was united , free , and at peace with its neighbors .
unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .
for the first time in history , germany was united , free , and at peace with its neighbors .
unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .
for the first time in history , germany was united , free , and at peace with its neighbors .
unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .

unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .

unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

the director of " hell " and " the butcher " died on sunday at the age of 80 . claude chabrol , the eminent french director who pioneered the new wave film style that revolutionized french cinema , died on sunday . news of the prolific 80-year-old filmmaker 's death was greeted with outpourings of sorrow from france 's political and cultural leaders .
" the whole of french cinema and france has lost one of its giants , " said martine aubry , leader of the opposition socialist party .
" claude chabrol 's cinema was one of the works which constructed our society 's vision of itself . "
french president nicolas sarkozy compared chabrol to 19th century novelist honore de balzac and renaissance writer francois rabelais , hailing " a great author and a great film-maker . "
a break with tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chabrol 's final film " bellamy " was released last year chabrol , a close friend of legendary new wave directors francois truffaut and jean-luc godard , broke with french cinematic tradition in the 1950s to produce films with contemporary themes , everyday characters and fragmented narrative structures .
chabrol was a prolific film-maker with some 80 movies to his name , including " hell " and " the butcher . "
at the peak of a career , the acadamie francaise awarded chabrol the rene clair prize in 2005 .
he was also honored for his life 's work at the 2009 berlin film festival .
in a statement on chabrol 's passing , france 's association of film directors said that each time a director dies , " a particular way of looking at the world and an expression of our humanity is lost forever . "

but not everyone is pleased about it . the recent 40 billion-euro -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- guarantees for germany 's troubled hypo real estate bank have been sharply criticized by parliamentarians from the ruling coalition . the christian democratic parliamentarian -lrb- cdu -rrb- leo dautzenberg said the announcement of the new guarantees happened " by the fog of night . "
the financial expert of the liberal free democratic party , frank schaeffler , said the hre was a " zombie bank " without a firm foundation .
germany 's banking sector stabilization fund soffin announced on friday that it would increase the volume of guarantees to about 40 billion euros to help keep the bank solvent .
scathing criticism dautzenberg said he wanted more information on the why the money has been granted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich-based bank failed the stress tests in july " the financial committee will critically examine the reasons surrounding the recent guarantees , " he told financial newspaper handelsblatt .
the fdp representative shaeffler said he was afraid the hre bank would become a bottomless pit at the expense of the taxpayer .
the hre bank , which nationalized last year in order to avoid bankruptcy , has since become heavily dependent on state guarantees in order to refinance its debt at competitive interest rates .
it was the only german bank to fail the europe-wide ' stress tests ' in july .

a new study has found that east germany 's economic situation has improved dramatically since then , but it still lags behind the west . a new study has found that the gap between former east german and west german states is narrowing .
that is despite disproportionately low wages and high unemployment in the eastern states . the survey , conducted by the ifo economic research institute for the magazine super illu , found that from 1991 to 2009 , the gross domestic product of the eastern german states doubled .
in western germany the gdp grew just 12 percent .
the wage gap between the two regions also shrunk in the two decades since reunification .
in 1991 the average east german worker earned just 57 percent of the equivalent salary in the western states .
now that figure is 83 percent . efficiency has also improved in the east .
in 1991 it took 77.2 hours of work to produce 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,272 -rrb- economic output while today it takes just 29 hours . in some areas the lifestyle in eastern german states has surpassed that of the western states , according to super illu .

today 's youth , he said , had no idea what a " frail " economy the gdr had in 1988 . billions of euros have been transferred eastward since german reunification and germans still pay a 5.5 percent solidarity tax to help rebuild the infrastructure and economy of the eastern german states .
unemployment remains persistently high in those states , however , currently at almost double the level seen among western germans . according to destasis , the national statistics office , 11.5 percent of eastern germans were unemployed in august while only 6.6 percent of western germans were unemployed . author : holly fox -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not everyone is pleased about it . the recent 40 billion-euro -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- guarantees for germany 's troubled hypo real estate bank have been sharply criticized by parliamentarians from the ruling coalition . the christian democratic parliamentarian -lrb- cdu -rrb- leo dautzenberg said the announcement of the new guarantees happened " by the fog of night . "
the financial expert of the liberal free democratic party , frank schaeffler , said the hre was a " zombie bank " without a firm foundation .
germany 's banking sector stabilization fund soffin announced on friday that it would increase the volume of guarantees to about 40 billion euros to help keep the bank solvent .
scathing criticism dautzenberg said he wanted more information on the why the money has been granted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich-based bank failed the stress tests in july " the financial committee will critically examine the reasons surrounding the recent guarantees , " he told financial newspaper handelsblatt .
the fdp representative shaeffler said he was afraid the hre bank would become a bottomless pit at the expense of the taxpayer .
the hre bank , which nationalized last year in order to avoid bankruptcy , has since become heavily dependent on state guarantees in order to refinance its debt at competitive interest rates .
it was the only german bank to fail the europe-wide ' stress tests ' in july .

but not everyone is pleased about it . the recent 40 billion-euro -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- guarantees for germany 's troubled hypo real estate bank have been sharply criticized by parliamentarians from the ruling coalition . the christian democratic parliamentarian -lrb- cdu -rrb- leo dautzenberg said the announcement of the new guarantees happened " by the fog of night . "
the financial expert of the liberal free democratic party , frank schaeffler , said the hre was a " zombie bank " without a firm foundation .
germany 's banking sector stabilization fund soffin announced on friday that it would increase the volume of guarantees to about 40 billion euros to help keep the bank solvent .
scathing criticism dautzenberg said he wanted more information on the why the money has been granted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich-based bank failed the stress tests in july " the financial committee will critically examine the reasons surrounding the recent guarantees , " he told financial newspaper handelsblatt .
the fdp representative shaeffler said he was afraid the hre bank would become a bottomless pit at the expense of the taxpayer .
the hre bank , which nationalized last year in order to avoid bankruptcy , has since become heavily dependent on state guarantees in order to refinance its debt at competitive interest rates .
it was the only german bank to fail the europe-wide ' stress tests ' in july .

a clear majority of voters appear to have eventually voted in favor , handing the government a decisive victory . about 58 percent of turkish voters approved constitutional changes to reshape the judiciary and curb military powers , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said sunday . erdogan , who campaigned across the country for the reforms , hailed the provisional poll results . " we have passed a historic threshold on the way to advanced democracy and the supremacy of law , " he said at a press conference in istanbul . german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the result and said he was confident that turkey would make further progress .
" the constitutional reform is another important step for turkey on the way to europe , " he said .
" i am confident that the reform process in turkey , in the sense of greater openness in society , will be continued . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's current constitution was written under a coup government the vote was described as " a step in the right direction " to fulfilling european union entry criteria by enlargement commissioner stefan fuele , adding that brussels would want to see words put into practice .
" a raft of implementation laws will be necessary and we will observe developments closely . " erdogan is eager to bring turkey more in line with european norms and distance it from its current constitution , which was established in 1982 after a coup d 'etat . supporters say the amendments will improve the state of turkey 's democracy and the fundamental rights of individuals , steps the eu has long called on turkey to take . " in normal times people say that they are against the coup and the constitution of the coup , so they now have chance to change it , " erdogan said , asking , " how can any one against the coup oppose these reforms ? " opposition fears for turkey 's secularism yet the country 's two main opposition parties - from both the right and left of the political spectrum - campaigned against the proposed judicial reforms in the package of 26 new or revised amendments . opposition leaders claimed that turkey 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , marked by its islamic roots , would use the reforms to seize control of the judiciary , thus undermining turkey 's secular state . the proposed judicial reforms included a bid to increase the number of constitutional court judges from 11 to 17 , giving parliament great power to select the new appointees .
the reforms would also lead to changes in the supreme board of judges and prosecutors . kemal kilicdaroglu , the leader of the center-left republican people 's party , said the proposed measures would put critics of the government in danger . " my call is to all the business people , all the artists and intellectuals , " he said .
" if ' yes ' comes out of the referendum , one morning your home can be raided , you can be taken into custody , and spend months in prison . " a society divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents fear the government will arrest more secular " enemies " opponents have said the government already enjoys a massive majority in parliament , adding that passing the reforms would mean lifting one of the last checks on government power .
they have also criticized the move to have voters decide on the entire package of reforms rather than on individual amendments . erdogan declared at the outset of the referendum process his hope that the reform package could unite the country by severing ties with its legacy of military rule .
but instead , the referendum appears to have further deepened the division within turkish society . " on secularism and conservatism , it is divided between half and half , " said political columnist nuray mert .
" on the definition of secularism and definition of democracy , people have strongly different opinions from each other and the gap between the two camps is widening each day .

the reforms would also lead to changes in the supreme board of judges and prosecutors . kemal kilicdaroglu , the leader of the center-left republican people 's party , said the proposed measures would put critics of the government in danger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 12.09.2010 how geopolitics paved the way to german reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2 plus 4 agreement was vital to german reunification after world war ii , the divided allies split germany into east and west .
twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .
for the first time in history , germany was united , free , and at peace with its neighbors .
unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

a particular point of contention was a government database that maintains income information . thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of berlin on saturday to call for enhanced data protection powers and less state intrusion of privacy . marching under the motto " freedom instead of fear " protesters called for limits on the amount of information that the state , as well as private organizations , can hold about individuals . among the concerns of participants was the centralization of health , financial , telecommunications and employment data . data can be used for ' insane purposes ' frank bsirske , head of the powerful verdi trade union , used the rally to call for an end to the elena employee income database and the retention of data by authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands marched for better data protection in berlin german employers currently must submit their employees ' income data to a government-sponsored central mainframe .
the elena database is believed to form part of germany 's largest ever data acquisition program . bsirske said the history of the last 80 years in european history showed that data collection could be used for " insane purposes . " demonstrators also criticized electronic cards for health insurance and the swift agreement , which gives the united states access to bank transaction details in the eu to carry out counterterrorism operations . organizers said that some 7,500 people had taken part in the demonstration , down on the figure for last year of 10,000 . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afpdpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a clear majority of voters appear to have eventually voted in favor , handing the government a decisive victory . about 58 percent of turkish voters approved constitutional changes to reshape the judiciary and curb military powers , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said sunday . erdogan , who campaigned across the country for the reforms , hailed the provisional poll results . " we have passed a historic threshold on the way to advanced democracy and the supremacy of law , " he said at a press conference in istanbul . german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the result and said he was confident that turkey would make further progress .
" the constitutional reform is another important step for turkey on the way to europe , " he said .
" i am confident that the reform process in turkey , in the sense of greater openness in society , will be continued . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's current constitution was written under a coup government the vote was described as " a step in the right direction " to fulfilling european union entry criteria by enlargement commissioner stefan fuele , adding that brussels would want to see words put into practice .
" a raft of implementation laws will be necessary and we will observe developments closely . " erdogan is eager to bring turkey more in line with european norms and distance it from its current constitution , which was established in 1982 after a coup d 'etat . supporters say the amendments will improve the state of turkey 's democracy and the fundamental rights of individuals , steps the eu has long called on turkey to take . " in normal times people say that they are against the coup and the constitution of the coup , so they now have chance to change it , " erdogan said , asking , " how can any one against the coup oppose these reforms ? " opposition fears for turkey 's secularism yet the country 's two main opposition parties - from both the right and left of the political spectrum - campaigned against the proposed judicial reforms in the package of 26 new or revised amendments . opposition leaders claimed that turkey 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , marked by its islamic roots , would use the reforms to seize control of the judiciary , thus undermining turkey 's secular state . the proposed judicial reforms included a bid to increase the number of constitutional court judges from 11 to 17 , giving parliament great power to select the new appointees .
the reforms would also lead to changes in the supreme board of judges and prosecutors . kemal kilicdaroglu , the leader of the center-left republican people 's party , said the proposed measures would put critics of the government in danger . " my call is to all the business people , all the artists and intellectuals , " he said .
" if ' yes ' comes out of the referendum , one morning your home can be raided , you can be taken into custody , and spend months in prison . " a society divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents fear the government will arrest more secular " enemies " opponents have said the government already enjoys a massive majority in parliament , adding that passing the reforms would mean lifting one of the last checks on government power .
they have also criticized the move to have voters decide on the entire package of reforms rather than on individual amendments . erdogan declared at the outset of the referendum process his hope that the reform package could unite the country by severing ties with its legacy of military rule .
but instead , the referendum appears to have further deepened the division within turkish society . " on secularism and conservatism , it is divided between half and half , " said political columnist nuray mert .
" on the definition of secularism and definition of democracy , people have strongly different opinions from each other and the gap between the two camps is widening each day .

a new study has found that east germany 's economic situation has improved dramatically since then , but it still lags behind the west . a new study has found that the gap between former east german and west german states is narrowing .
that is despite disproportionately low wages and high unemployment in the eastern states . the survey , conducted by the ifo economic research institute for the magazine super illu , found that from 1991 to 2009 , the gross domestic product of the eastern german states doubled .
in western germany the gdp grew just 12 percent .
the wage gap between the two regions also shrunk in the two decades since reunification .
in 1991 the average east german worker earned just 57 percent of the equivalent salary in the western states .
now that figure is 83 percent . efficiency has also improved in the east .

but at least one critic claimed the contest was rigged . sofia coppola 's film " somewhere " won her the venice film festival 's highest honor on saturday .
the head of the seven-person jury , quentin tarantino , presented coppola with the golden lion . " from that first enchanted screening it grew and grew in our hearts , in our minds , in our affections , " he said of the film , admitting that as the jury discussed the other films , " somewhere " kept popping up in their conversations . tarantino faced claims the jury 's decisions were unfair as he and coppola were once romantically involved with each other and tarantino 's friend and mentor monte hellman won a special award for his career 's work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " somewhere " has won praise for its portrayal of hollywood life " the -lrb- jury -rrb- presidency of quentin tarantino runs the risk of being the most obvious conflict of interest , given that " somewhere " and -lrb- hellman 's -rrb- " road to nowhere " seemed charming and intriguing but nothing more , " paolo mereghetti , a film critic for italian daily corriere della sera , wrote in sunday 's edition . other surprise decisions came in the form of the spanish entry " balada triste de trompeta , " which won best director and screenplay prizes for alex de la iglesia and was widely panned , and the best actor award for " essential killing " star vincent gallo , who did not have a single line in the film .
this year no italian movie earned an award . coppola , the 39-year-old american filmmaker , thanked her father , famed director francis ford coppola " for teaching me . " " somewhere " portrays the empty life of an a-list hollywood star and his relationship with his pre-teen daughter .
coppola won an oscar in 2003 for the screenplay to " lost in translation , " another film about loneliness . the oldest film festival alex de la iglesia from spain won the silver lion for best director for his film " a sad trumpet ballad , " a dark comedy that he described as an attempt to " exorcise " the pain of the spanish civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the best actor award when to vincent gallo for his role as an escaped detainee in poland jerzy skolimowski 's " essential killing , " about an american taliban fighter who is captured in afghanistan and then escapes from the polish detention center where he is sent , won both the special jury prize as well as a best actor award for vincent gallo . after arriving in venice in a balaclava , gallo , who had his own movie " promises written in water " in the competition , steered clear of the public eye during the festival , which ran from september 1-11 .
he did not personally accept his award . french-greek actress ariane labed won the best actress award for her role in greek director athina rachel tsangari 's " attenberg . "
american cult director monte hellman was awarded a special lion for overall work . this was the 67th venice film festival , the oldest film festival in the world .

meting out justice to those involved in atrocities committed by serbs during the breakup of the former yugoslavia in a series of wars in the 1990s is a key condition for the eu in membership talks . serbia is looking to conclude a stabilization and association agreement , one step towards membership , but must first arrest and extradite ratko mladic .
mladic is the bosnian serb army leader who commanded the troops responsible for the mass killing of bosnian muslim men and boys in srebrenica in 1995 .

a new study has found that east germany 's economic situation has improved dramatically since then , but it still lags behind the west . a new study has found that the gap between former east german and west german states is narrowing .
that is despite disproportionately low wages and high unemployment in the eastern states . the survey , conducted by the ifo economic research institute for the magazine super illu , found that from 1991 to 2009 , the gross domestic product of the eastern german states doubled .
in western germany the gdp grew just 12 percent .
the wage gap between the two regions also shrunk in the two decades since reunification .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 12.09.2010 how geopolitics paved the way to german reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2 plus 4 agreement was vital to german reunification after world war ii , the divided allies split germany into east and west .
twenty years ago this month , the 2 plus 4 agreement set the conditions for german reunification , ending the 40-year-old cold war in central europe . as the war against nazi germany drew to a close , suspicion and distrust divided the once united allies into opposing blocs .
political disagreement escalated to confrontation , and a definitive peace agreement became unfeasible .
the west and the soviet union agreed to disagree , drawing a geopolitical fault line through central europe that split a defeated germany in two .
this stalemate , which came to be called the cold war , froze europe in a seemingly permanent state of division .
but as a new era of globalization emerged on the horizon during the 1980s , soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev instituted political reforms that sent tremors through the eastern bloc .
when the wave of popular political upheaval finally crashed upon eastern germany , it became increasingly clear that german reunification would occur sooner rather than later .
the word war ii allies - but cold war foes - met in moscow in september 1990 to discuss the geopolitical prerequisites for german reunification .
the soviet union , the united states , the united kingdom , france and the two germanies ironed out a treaty called the 2 plus 4 agreement , which would usher europe into a new era of unity and freedom .
bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from the four victors of wwii and both germanies signed the deal 20 years ago demilitarization of central europe central europe had been a source of political tension , and thus militarization , for most of the 20th century .
the 2 plus 4 agreement sought a political solution that would ensure a germany at peace with itself and its neighbors .
" involved -lsb- in the treaty -rsb- was a fundamental reduction of troop strength , so that a clear step in the direction of peace in central europe would be taken , because this area had the highest troop and weapon concentrations up to that point , " said lothar de maiziere , the prime minister of east germany at that time .
the allies agreed to relinquish their rights over germany and withdraw their militaries under certain conditions .
a united germany would be a member of nato , but would reduce its military to 370,000 troops and abstain from possessing atomic , biological and chemical weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail gorbachev supported german reunification and entry into nato at great political risk although the west and the soviets established these preconditions to protect their own security interests , gorbachev faced significant opposition in moscow , which almost cost him his position .
soviet influence in central europe would diminish significantly if a reunited germany entered nato .
this scenario was unacceptable to hardliners in russia .
" i would n't say he was down about it , but he was certainly aware of the fact that he had taken on a major responsibility and that the orthodox forces in the communist party would not rest , but instead would try to change things , " said hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister during the negotiations .
" and we indeed witnessed a year later almost to the day the coup in moscow . "
permanent borders although the borders established after world war ii existed as a de-facto reality , they were disputed by many west germans .
if west germany recognized the oder-neisse border with poland , it would abandon any claims to the large swath of territory lost after world war ii .
many of the germans expelled from the eastern territories lived in west germany , making it a politically explosive domestic issue for most of the cold war .
the 2 plus 4 agreement , also called the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany , recognized all european borders established after world war ii , resolving this outstanding dispute once and for all .
bonn and berlin 's signatures to the treaty meant that a newly reunited germany would recognize national borders as they stood , not as they once were .
coupled with the reduction in military concentrations , the acceptance of current borders was a significant step toward an enduring peace in europe at large .
reunification and integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reunification cleared the way for further european integration as well with the ratification of the 2 plus 4 agreement , the geopolitical conditions were set for germany to become a single nation after decades of division .
for the first time in history , germany was united , free , and at peace with its neighbors .
unity in central europe set the conditions for further european integration , with germany acting as the bridge between the west and the newly democratic east .
" the two german states were members of the un , west germany was a member of the european community , and with the reunification east germany became a part of it as well , " genscher said .
" we were highly active in the conference on security and cooperation in europe , because it opened the way to german reunification . those were difficult decisions for germany . "
just three weeks after the signing of the 2 plus 4 agreement , germans celebrated unification in berlin .
and two years later , the maastricht treaty was signed , which created the european union .
this cleared the way for a europe united and free , from west to east .

" we have passed a historic threshold on the way to advanced democracy and the supremacy of law , " he said at a press conference in istanbul . german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the result and said he was confident that turkey would make further progress .
