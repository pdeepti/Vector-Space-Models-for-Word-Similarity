program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.12.2010 more german catholics leave scandal-plagued flock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german churches already have a hard time filling pews , so the latest news is not good tens of thousands of german catholics cancelled their church membership in 2010 - considerably more than in 2009 - taking their automatic tax donations with them .
the recent abuse scandals motivated many church-leavers . thousands more german catholics have left their church this year than in 2009 , with the recent string of sexual abuse revelations and other public scandals apparently motivating many people 's decisions .
recent studies by the frankfurter rundschau daily and the dpa news agency concur that the country 's catholic churches have lost considerably more members in 2010 than in recent years .
the bavarian diocese of augsburg , where bishop walter mixa was forced to stand down in april over physical abuse and embezzlement accusations , recorded some of the worst figures : as of mid-december , 11,351 believers had left the church , compared to 6,953 in 2009 .
in the south-western rottenburg-stuttgart diocese , 17,169 catholics had left the church as of mid-november , almost seven thousand more than in 2009 .
trier , wuerzburg , osnabrueck and bamberg all recorded significant increases in departures in 2010 , with many disgruntled catholics apparently seeking new homes with other christian denominations .
membership means money early indications suggest that the prime mover for people leaving their congregation was the series of sex abuse scandals that have rocked the catholic church , and the church 's handling of them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal over pedophile priests appears to be driving more away from the church in april and may , with the public outcry at its peak , most church leavers cited this as the reason , and particularly high departure numbers in the more scandal-hit diocese of augsburg , for instance , would seem to suggest a correlation .
" every single departure is one too many , " wuerzburg bishop friedhelm hofmann said in an interview where he suggested that the pedophile priest problems had a hand in the exodus .
" i hope that some people will come back to us , once the anger at current events subsides , and when people once again focus on all the good things the church does every day , " he added .
germany 's catholic church has been taking steps to try to prevent future abuse cases and shed light on past ones in recent months , but critics argue that the response has been slow and that catholic leaders still intend to prevent past perpetrators from ever facing justice .
meanwhile , some catholic leaders are not convinced that the declining size of the german flock in 2010 is linked to the negative headlines that dominated the year .
" as a rule , an official departure from the church is the culmination of a longer process of estrangement , " osnabrueck bishop hermann haarmann said .
in germany , officially becoming a member of a religion has financial significance , not just a symbolic one .
german citizens who are members of a religious group officially recognized by the government in berlin automatically pay a " church tax " deducted from their monthly paychecks .

known as " europe 's last dictator , " president alexander lukashenko is expected to claim a fourth term , despite facing nine opposition candidates . belarusian voters have never had so much choice .
in addition to the incumbent , alexander lukashenko , nine other candidates ' names , including a poet and a businessman , are on sunday 's presidential election ballot .
but lukashenko 's victory is all but certain . at the last election four years ago there were just four candidates and lukashenko 's main opposition in 2006 , alexander milinkevich , decided not to run and months ago called the poll a " political spectacle . " opposition candidates have complained lukashenko has curtailed their access to the public during the campaign , limiting their media exposure to a pair of live 30-minute radio and television appearances . no way opposition can succeed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has been little in the way of campaigning , the osce said " the state apparatus is pretending when it says candidates have been offered a broad set of opportunities , " belarusian director yuri chashchevatsky said .

television news was " dominated by extensive reporting on the president 's activities , " the organization noted . unlike his competitors , lukashenko did not make use of the hour to present his program to voters in the former soviet republic nor did he participate in a television debate among presidential candidates . instead , he sees the election as the only way to validate a result everyone knows has already been determined , according to political scientist valeri karbalewitsch .

the president admitted to rigging the 2006 election , in which official results showed he received 83 percent of the vote . " i gave the order for it to be not 93 percent , but something around 80 , i ca n't remember how much , " he said in 2009 .
" when you get over 90 , this is not accepted psychologically .
but it was the truth . " after 16 years in office , lukashenko , 56 , said he is the only person with enough experience to lead the country , which did away with term limits in a 2004 referendum .
lukashenko warned opponents not to protest the election 's outcome . " dear friends , do n't go out on to the streets or anywhere , " he said .
" you are not going to get the country .
we are not going to let you tear it up .
it 's cost us too dear . " thousands of protesters took to the streets after the 2006 elections in protest of the rigged poll .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.12.2010 more german catholics leave scandal-plagued flock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german churches already have a hard time filling pews , so the latest news is not good tens of thousands of german catholics cancelled their church membership in 2010 - considerably more than in 2009 - taking their automatic tax donations with them .
the recent abuse scandals motivated many church-leavers . thousands more german catholics have left their church this year than in 2009 , with the recent string of sexual abuse revelations and other public scandals apparently motivating many people 's decisions .
recent studies by the frankfurter rundschau daily and the dpa news agency concur that the country 's catholic churches have lost considerably more members in 2010 than in recent years .
the bavarian diocese of augsburg , where bishop walter mixa was forced to stand down in april over physical abuse and embezzlement accusations , recorded some of the worst figures : as of mid-december , 11,351 believers had left the church , compared to 6,953 in 2009 .
in the south-western rottenburg-stuttgart diocese , 17,169 catholics had left the church as of mid-november , almost seven thousand more than in 2009 .
trier , wuerzburg , osnabrueck and bamberg all recorded significant increases in departures in 2010 , with many disgruntled catholics apparently seeking new homes with other christian denominations .
membership means money early indications suggest that the prime mover for people leaving their congregation was the series of sex abuse scandals that have rocked the catholic church , and the church 's handling of them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal over pedophile priests appears to be driving more away from the church in april and may , with the public outcry at its peak , most church leavers cited this as the reason , and particularly high departure numbers in the more scandal-hit diocese of augsburg , for instance , would seem to suggest a correlation .
" every single departure is one too many , " wuerzburg bishop friedhelm hofmann said in an interview where he suggested that the pedophile priest problems had a hand in the exodus .
" i hope that some people will come back to us , once the anger at current events subsides , and when people once again focus on all the good things the church does every day , " he added .
germany 's catholic church has been taking steps to try to prevent future abuse cases and shed light on past ones in recent months , but critics argue that the response has been slow and that catholic leaders still intend to prevent past perpetrators from ever facing justice .
meanwhile , some catholic leaders are not convinced that the declining size of the german flock in 2010 is linked to the negative headlines that dominated the year .
" as a rule , an official departure from the church is the culmination of a longer process of estrangement , " osnabrueck bishop hermann haarmann said .
in germany , officially becoming a member of a religion has financial significance , not just a symbolic one .
german citizens who are members of a religious group officially recognized by the government in berlin automatically pay a " church tax " deducted from their monthly paychecks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 19.12.2010 new study concludes the world is actually getting safer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study says that today more wars end than start the news may be full of violence and strife , but a just-published statistical analysis , the human security report , says conflicts are becoming less deadly .
dw looks at the reasons why . good news is no news .
that would be a way of putting one of the conclusions of the human security report published in early december .
the report , the product of a research group at simon fraser university in vancouver , canada , compiles statistics of conflicts -lrb- more than 25 deaths annually -rrb- and wars -lrb- more than 1,000 -rrb- around the world .
it also analyzes why violent conflicts start and how they end .
the upshot is that , over the course of the past five decades , conflicts have become less frequent , less lethal and more likely to be resolved .
in the 1950s , for example , the average international conflict killed 21,000 people annually .
in the new millennium , that figure is less than 3,000 .
the idea that world is getting more peaceful seems counter-intuitive , but that may reflect an inherent bias of what makes the news .
" media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the ' if it bleeds , it leads ' imperative , " human security report project director andrew mack told deutsche welle .
" this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored . "
astonishingly , the report finds that mortality rates sometimes even decline in times of warfare , due to the continuation of pre-conflict improvements in health infrastructure .
but counting the dead is one thing .
and analyzing the reasons why people try to kill each other , and the best means for persuading them not to , is another .
prosperity changes attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's intervention in the balkans is one successful example of peacemaking negative factors , the end of colonialism and the cold war , have influenced the declining death tolls , belying the idea that the deterrent force of military power is the best guarantor of peace .
but the report also identifies positive factors such as the spread of democracy , increases in average national prosperity , globalization and intensified international peace initiatives as major motors for ending and preventing armed conflict .
" as the level of what might be called ' international activism ' has gone up the number of wars have come down , " mack said . " indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people per year - than in 1988 . "
moreover , there are less tangible elements such as people 's attitudes toward violence itself .
the change is particularly marked in europe .
" most oecd countries feel secure from attack , not because of the mutually deterring effect of their military forces , but because they do not believe that other states wish to attack them , " the report concludes .
" among the countries of western europe , the idea that disputes might be settled by war has become simply unthinkable . "
" disputes , " in this context , refers to conflicts between nations that share a common set of values .
but what about conflicts between the world 's leading countries and subcultures bent on destroying the status quo ?
osama 's acolytes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden still makes the news , but support for him is declining according the report , islamist radicalism represents the greatest threat in the world today , fueling four of the five deadliest conflicts on the planet - in iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia .
but on this front , too , the news is partially good .
although the us-led " war on terror " is sometimes perceived as a war on muslims in general , support for al-qaeda and similar organizations is declining .
that 's because of the brutal nature of islamist radicals , most of whose violence is perpetrated against fellow muslims , and a general sense that all osama bin laden has to offer is a dead-end street .
" the decline in public support means that the radicals have little change of winning popular revolutions , " mack said .
" on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose . "
jihad remains a threat , but if the report is correct , it stands little chance of going global .
measuring results bildunterschrift : the report predicts the world will continue to grow more peaceful as is always the case with statistics , there is argument about how these sorts of numbers should be tallied and what they truly mean .
the united nations ' human development report puts the number of deaths in some conflicts far higher than the human security report .
and there has been some criticism that the concept of " human security " is itself biased to promote a neoliberal agenda of capitalism and globalization .
the human security report 's director says the aim is not to promote a given ideology but to provide proof of what does and does n't work .
" governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be ' evidence-based , " ' mack told deutsche welle .
" providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not . "
even if the picture of world presented by the human security report turns out to be too rosy , it does support the efforts of organizations like the un , which critics often accuse of being completely ineffectual .
and in any case it 's an intriguing thought that perhaps , despite the carnage regularly dominating the news , humanity might be on the right track after all .

the report , the product of a research group at simon fraser university in vancouver , canada , compiles statistics of conflicts -lrb- more than 25 deaths annually -rrb- and wars -lrb- more than 1,000 -rrb- around the world .
it also analyzes why violent conflicts start and how they end .
the upshot is that , over the course of the past five decades , conflicts have become less frequent , less lethal and more likely to be resolved .
in the 1950s , for example , the average international conflict killed 21,000 people annually .
in the new millennium , that figure is less than 3,000 .
the idea that world is getting more peaceful seems counter-intuitive , but that may reflect an inherent bias of what makes the news .
" media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the ' if it bleeds , it leads ' imperative , " human security report project director andrew mack told deutsche welle .
" this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored . "
astonishingly , the report finds that mortality rates sometimes even decline in times of warfare , due to the continuation of pre-conflict improvements in health infrastructure .

although the us-led " war on terror " is sometimes perceived as a war on muslims in general , support for al-qaeda and similar organizations is declining .

officials at germany 's largest airport in frankfurt have confirmed that at least 540 flights were canceled on sunday due to bad weather . dozens of european airports have been scrambling to keep their scheduled flights running , despite heavy snow and freezing temperatures . officials from frankfurt international airport , the largest in germany , announced sunday that at least 540 flights were canceled .
further disruptions are possible , the airport spokesman said , partly depending on how other airports cope with the weather .
frankfurt was forced to cancel 272 flights on saturday . with thousands of people still waiting on their planes , a police spokesman said the atmosphere in the airport was calm , after officers on saturday were called to stop frustrated passengers from turning violent . " there are still a lot of people here , but they 're behaving in an orderly manner , " the spokesman told reporters . frustrated flyers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelic intervention may be necessary to lighten the mood " we understand when airlines call the police for help because they can not cope with passengers , " an airport spokesperson said , adding that the atmosphere in frankfurt 's terminals had become " very tense " on saturday . witnesses said the unrest verged on violence at a lufthansa check-in counter , where a group of stranded and rerouted passengers waiting in line became abusive toward a group of new passengers who were trying to check in to flights set to leave on time . they said passengers from the first queue threatened newcomers , who tried to push forward to the desk in order to make their flights .
police had to separate the two groups . in addition to the police , airport employees dressed as angels are also walking the terminals to keep stranded passengers calm . officials in frankfurt said on sunday that one of the airport 's runways was entirely clear of snow , with workers trying to prepare the others at full capacity . many of the cancelations so far , they said , had been due to disruptions at other airports across europe , particularly in croatia and italy .
florence and pisa 's airports had closed after getting as much as 20 centimeters -lrb- eight inches -rrb- of snow . " our timetables are in utter shambles , " an airport spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
germany 's flagship airline , lufthansa , scrapped its regular flight schedule and announced an emergency timetable would go into effect until the situation had improved . it advised domestic travelers to try to reach their destinations by rail . bildunterschrift : witnesses say they saw angry passengers threaten each other in frankfurt 's crowded terminals cancelations across europe europe 's busiest hub , london heathrow , was forced to shut down entirely on saturday and was not accepting inbound flights on sunday .
authorities said only a few planes would be leaving . " there comes a point at which the weather has such an impact that it 's simply not safe to fly , " andrew teacher , spokesman for airport operator baa , told bbc television . delays and cancelations also continued at london 's gatwick airport . on saturday , some 200 out of 500 flights had been canceled by midday . dozens of flights were also canceled at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on saturday , after about 3,000 people had been forced to spend the night at the airport on friday , where they were provided with 1,700 cots . in france , about half of the flights at paris ' charles de gaulle hub were delayed saturday by between 40 and 50 minutes due to local weather conditions as well as to delays from northern europe . meanwhile , high-speed eurostar trains from london to brussels and paris were placed under strict speed restrictions beginning on friday . in italy , high-speed trains between milan , florence and rome were canceled , forcing some 5,000 passengers to seek shelter in a conference hall in the tuscan capital . pointing fingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many flight cancelations were due to closed airports in italy frankfurt airport had already been having difficulty coping with inclement winter weather this season before the beginning of christmas holiday travel season . a week ago , the airport company and airlines pointed fingers at each other after lufthansa got into a tiff with the ukrainian government over the airline 's refusal to rebook 200 stranded ukrainian passengers onto other airlines . airport officials have admitted that a new computer system to plan landings and take-offs has proven faulty , but said many cancelations had also occurred because airlines were too stingy to keep reserve crews .
some jets were kept grounded , one official said , to let crew members sleep . lufthansa has meanwhile blamed frankfurt airport for failing to de-ice jets fast enough . author : david levitz , mark hallam -lrb- afp , ap , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials at germany 's largest airport in frankfurt have confirmed that at least 540 flights were canceled on sunday due to bad weather . dozens of european airports have been scrambling to keep their scheduled flights running , despite heavy snow and freezing temperatures . officials from frankfurt international airport , the largest in germany , announced sunday that at least 540 flights were canceled .
further disruptions are possible , the airport spokesman said , partly depending on how other airports cope with the weather .
frankfurt was forced to cancel 272 flights on saturday . with thousands of people still waiting on their planes , a police spokesman said the atmosphere in the airport was calm , after officers on saturday were called to stop frustrated passengers from turning violent . " there are still a lot of people here , but they 're behaving in an orderly manner , " the spokesman told reporters . frustrated flyers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelic intervention may be necessary to lighten the mood " we understand when airlines call the police for help because they can not cope with passengers , " an airport spokesperson said , adding that the atmosphere in frankfurt 's terminals had become " very tense " on saturday . witnesses said the unrest verged on violence at a lufthansa check-in counter , where a group of stranded and rerouted passengers waiting in line became abusive toward a group of new passengers who were trying to check in to flights set to leave on time . they said passengers from the first queue threatened newcomers , who tried to push forward to the desk in order to make their flights .
police had to separate the two groups . in addition to the police , airport employees dressed as angels are also walking the terminals to keep stranded passengers calm . officials in frankfurt said on sunday that one of the airport 's runways was entirely clear of snow , with workers trying to prepare the others at full capacity . many of the cancelations so far , they said , had been due to disruptions at other airports across europe , particularly in croatia and italy .
florence and pisa 's airports had closed after getting as much as 20 centimeters -lrb- eight inches -rrb- of snow . " our timetables are in utter shambles , " an airport spokesperson told german news agency dpa .
germany 's flagship airline , lufthansa , scrapped its regular flight schedule and announced an emergency timetable would go into effect until the situation had improved . it advised domestic travelers to try to reach their destinations by rail . bildunterschrift : witnesses say they saw angry passengers threaten each other in frankfurt 's crowded terminals cancelations across europe europe 's busiest hub , london heathrow , was forced to shut down entirely on saturday and was not accepting inbound flights on sunday .
authorities said only a few planes would be leaving . " there comes a point at which the weather has such an impact that it 's simply not safe to fly , " andrew teacher , spokesman for airport operator baa , told bbc television . delays and cancelations also continued at london 's gatwick airport . on saturday , some 200 out of 500 flights had been canceled by midday . dozens of flights were also canceled at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on saturday , after about 3,000 people had been forced to spend the night at the airport on friday , where they were provided with 1,700 cots . in france , about half of the flights at paris ' charles de gaulle hub were delayed saturday by between 40 and 50 minutes due to local weather conditions as well as to delays from northern europe . meanwhile , high-speed eurostar trains from london to brussels and paris were placed under strict speed restrictions beginning on friday . in italy , high-speed trains between milan , florence and rome were canceled , forcing some 5,000 passengers to seek shelter in a conference hall in the tuscan capital . pointing fingers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many flight cancelations were due to closed airports in italy frankfurt airport had already been having difficulty coping with inclement winter weather this season before the beginning of christmas holiday travel season . a week ago , the airport company and airlines pointed fingers at each other after lufthansa got into a tiff with the ukrainian government over the airline 's refusal to rebook 200 stranded ukrainian passengers onto other airlines . airport officials have admitted that a new computer system to plan landings and take-offs has proven faulty , but said many cancelations had also occurred because airlines were too stingy to keep reserve crews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 19.12.2010 new study concludes the world is actually getting safer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study says that today more wars end than start the news may be full of violence and strife , but a just-published statistical analysis , the human security report , says conflicts are becoming less deadly .
dw looks at the reasons why . good news is no news .
that would be a way of putting one of the conclusions of the human security report published in early december .
the report , the product of a research group at simon fraser university in vancouver , canada , compiles statistics of conflicts -lrb- more than 25 deaths annually -rrb- and wars -lrb- more than 1,000 -rrb- around the world .
it also analyzes why violent conflicts start and how they end .
the upshot is that , over the course of the past five decades , conflicts have become less frequent , less lethal and more likely to be resolved .
in the 1950s , for example , the average international conflict killed 21,000 people annually .
in the new millennium , that figure is less than 3,000 .
the idea that world is getting more peaceful seems counter-intuitive , but that may reflect an inherent bias of what makes the news .
" media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the ' if it bleeds , it leads ' imperative , " human security report project director andrew mack told deutsche welle .
" this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored . "
astonishingly , the report finds that mortality rates sometimes even decline in times of warfare , due to the continuation of pre-conflict improvements in health infrastructure .
but counting the dead is one thing .
and analyzing the reasons why people try to kill each other , and the best means for persuading them not to , is another .
prosperity changes attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's intervention in the balkans is one successful example of peacemaking negative factors , the end of colonialism and the cold war , have influenced the declining death tolls , belying the idea that the deterrent force of military power is the best guarantor of peace .
but the report also identifies positive factors such as the spread of democracy , increases in average national prosperity , globalization and intensified international peace initiatives as major motors for ending and preventing armed conflict .
" as the level of what might be called ' international activism ' has gone up the number of wars have come down , " mack said . " indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people per year - than in 1988 . "
moreover , there are less tangible elements such as people 's attitudes toward violence itself .
the change is particularly marked in europe .
" most oecd countries feel secure from attack , not because of the mutually deterring effect of their military forces , but because they do not believe that other states wish to attack them , " the report concludes .
" among the countries of western europe , the idea that disputes might be settled by war has become simply unthinkable . "
" disputes , " in this context , refers to conflicts between nations that share a common set of values .
but what about conflicts between the world 's leading countries and subcultures bent on destroying the status quo ?
osama 's acolytes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden still makes the news , but support for him is declining according the report , islamist radicalism represents the greatest threat in the world today , fueling four of the five deadliest conflicts on the planet - in iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia .
but on this front , too , the news is partially good .
although the us-led " war on terror " is sometimes perceived as a war on muslims in general , support for al-qaeda and similar organizations is declining .
that 's because of the brutal nature of islamist radicals , most of whose violence is perpetrated against fellow muslims , and a general sense that all osama bin laden has to offer is a dead-end street .
" the decline in public support means that the radicals have little change of winning popular revolutions , " mack said .
" on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose . "
jihad remains a threat , but if the report is correct , it stands little chance of going global .
measuring results bildunterschrift : the report predicts the world will continue to grow more peaceful as is always the case with statistics , there is argument about how these sorts of numbers should be tallied and what they truly mean .
the united nations ' human development report puts the number of deaths in some conflicts far higher than the human security report .
and there has been some criticism that the concept of " human security " is itself biased to promote a neoliberal agenda of capitalism and globalization .
the human security report 's director says the aim is not to promote a given ideology but to provide proof of what does and does n't work .
" governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be ' evidence-based , " ' mack told deutsche welle .
" providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not . "
even if the picture of world presented by the human security report turns out to be too rosy , it does support the efforts of organizations like the un , which critics often accuse of being completely ineffectual .
and in any case it 's an intriguing thought that perhaps , despite the carnage regularly dominating the news , humanity might be on the right track after all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.12.2010 more german catholics leave scandal-plagued flock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german churches already have a hard time filling pews , so the latest news is not good tens of thousands of german catholics cancelled their church membership in 2010 - considerably more than in 2009 - taking their automatic tax donations with them .
the recent abuse scandals motivated many church-leavers . thousands more german catholics have left their church this year than in 2009 , with the recent string of sexual abuse revelations and other public scandals apparently motivating many people 's decisions .
recent studies by the frankfurter rundschau daily and the dpa news agency concur that the country 's catholic churches have lost considerably more members in 2010 than in recent years .
the bavarian diocese of augsburg , where bishop walter mixa was forced to stand down in april over physical abuse and embezzlement accusations , recorded some of the worst figures : as of mid-december , 11,351 believers had left the church , compared to 6,953 in 2009 .
in the south-western rottenburg-stuttgart diocese , 17,169 catholics had left the church as of mid-november , almost seven thousand more than in 2009 .
trier , wuerzburg , osnabrueck and bamberg all recorded significant increases in departures in 2010 , with many disgruntled catholics apparently seeking new homes with other christian denominations .
membership means money early indications suggest that the prime mover for people leaving their congregation was the series of sex abuse scandals that have rocked the catholic church , and the church 's handling of them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal over pedophile priests appears to be driving more away from the church in april and may , with the public outcry at its peak , most church leavers cited this as the reason , and particularly high departure numbers in the more scandal-hit diocese of augsburg , for instance , would seem to suggest a correlation .
" every single departure is one too many , " wuerzburg bishop friedhelm hofmann said in an interview where he suggested that the pedophile priest problems had a hand in the exodus .
" i hope that some people will come back to us , once the anger at current events subsides , and when people once again focus on all the good things the church does every day , " he added .
germany 's catholic church has been taking steps to try to prevent future abuse cases and shed light on past ones in recent months , but critics argue that the response has been slow and that catholic leaders still intend to prevent past perpetrators from ever facing justice .
meanwhile , some catholic leaders are not convinced that the declining size of the german flock in 2010 is linked to the negative headlines that dominated the year .
" as a rule , an official departure from the church is the culmination of a longer process of estrangement , " osnabrueck bishop hermann haarmann said .
in germany , officially becoming a member of a religion has financial significance , not just a symbolic one .
german citizens who are members of a religious group officially recognized by the government in berlin automatically pay a " church tax " deducted from their monthly paychecks .

dw looks at the reasons why . good news is no news .
that would be a way of putting one of the conclusions of the human security report published in early december .
the report , the product of a research group at simon fraser university in vancouver , canada , compiles statistics of conflicts -lrb- more than 25 deaths annually -rrb- and wars -lrb- more than 1,000 -rrb- around the world .
it also analyzes why violent conflicts start and how they end .
the upshot is that , over the course of the past five decades , conflicts have become less frequent , less lethal and more likely to be resolved .
in the 1950s , for example , the average international conflict killed 21,000 people annually .
in the new millennium , that figure is less than 3,000 .
the idea that world is getting more peaceful seems counter-intuitive , but that may reflect an inherent bias of what makes the news .
" media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the ' if it bleeds , it leads ' imperative , " human security report project director andrew mack told deutsche welle .
" this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored . "
astonishingly , the report finds that mortality rates sometimes even decline in times of warfare , due to the continuation of pre-conflict improvements in health infrastructure .
but counting the dead is one thing .
and analyzing the reasons why people try to kill each other , and the best means for persuading them not to , is another .
prosperity changes attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's intervention in the balkans is one successful example of peacemaking negative factors , the end of colonialism and the cold war , have influenced the declining death tolls , belying the idea that the deterrent force of military power is the best guarantor of peace .
but the report also identifies positive factors such as the spread of democracy , increases in average national prosperity , globalization and intensified international peace initiatives as major motors for ending and preventing armed conflict .
" as the level of what might be called ' international activism ' has gone up the number of wars have come down , " mack said . " indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people per year - than in 1988 . "
moreover , there are less tangible elements such as people 's attitudes toward violence itself .
the change is particularly marked in europe .
" most oecd countries feel secure from attack , not because of the mutually deterring effect of their military forces , but because they do not believe that other states wish to attack them , " the report concludes .
" among the countries of western europe , the idea that disputes might be settled by war has become simply unthinkable . "
" disputes , " in this context , refers to conflicts between nations that share a common set of values .

but on this front , too , the news is partially good .
although the us-led " war on terror " is sometimes perceived as a war on muslims in general , support for al-qaeda and similar organizations is declining .
that 's because of the brutal nature of islamist radicals , most of whose violence is perpetrated against fellow muslims , and a general sense that all osama bin laden has to offer is a dead-end street .
" the decline in public support means that the radicals have little change of winning popular revolutions , " mack said .
" on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose . "
jihad remains a threat , but if the report is correct , it stands little chance of going global .
measuring results bildunterschrift : the report predicts the world will continue to grow more peaceful as is always the case with statistics , there is argument about how these sorts of numbers should be tallied and what they truly mean .
the united nations ' human development report puts the number of deaths in some conflicts far higher than the human security report .
and there has been some criticism that the concept of " human security " is itself biased to promote a neoliberal agenda of capitalism and globalization .
the human security report 's director says the aim is not to promote a given ideology but to provide proof of what does and does n't work .
" governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be ' evidence-based , " ' mack told deutsche welle .
" providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not . "
even if the picture of world presented by the human security report turns out to be too rosy , it does support the efforts of organizations like the un , which critics often accuse of being completely ineffectual .
and in any case it 's an intriguing thought that perhaps , despite the carnage regularly dominating the news , humanity might be on the right track after all .

officials at germany 's largest airport in frankfurt have confirmed that at least 540 flights were canceled on sunday due to bad weather . dozens of european airports have been scrambling to keep their scheduled flights running , despite heavy snow and freezing temperatures . officials from frankfurt international airport , the largest in germany , announced sunday that at least 540 flights were canceled .

" there are still a lot of people here , but they 're behaving in an orderly manner , " the spokesman told reporters . frustrated flyers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelic intervention may be necessary to lighten the mood " we understand when airlines call the police for help because they can not cope with passengers , " an airport spokesperson said , adding that the atmosphere in frankfurt 's terminals had become " very tense " on saturday . witnesses said the unrest verged on violence at a lufthansa check-in counter , where a group of stranded and rerouted passengers waiting in line became abusive toward a group of new passengers who were trying to check in to flights set to leave on time . they said passengers from the first queue threatened newcomers , who tried to push forward to the desk in order to make their flights .
police had to separate the two groups . in addition to the police , airport employees dressed as angels are also walking the terminals to keep stranded passengers calm . officials in frankfurt said on sunday that one of the airport 's runways was entirely clear of snow , with workers trying to prepare the others at full capacity . many of the cancelations so far , they said , had been due to disruptions at other airports across europe , particularly in croatia and italy .

but on this front , too , the news is partially good .
although the us-led " war on terror " is sometimes perceived as a war on muslims in general , support for al-qaeda and similar organizations is declining .
that 's because of the brutal nature of islamist radicals , most of whose violence is perpetrated against fellow muslims , and a general sense that all osama bin laden has to offer is a dead-end street .

dw looks at the reasons why . good news is no news .
that would be a way of putting one of the conclusions of the human security report published in early december .
the report , the product of a research group at simon fraser university in vancouver , canada , compiles statistics of conflicts -lrb- more than 25 deaths annually -rrb- and wars -lrb- more than 1,000 -rrb- around the world .
it also analyzes why violent conflicts start and how they end .
the upshot is that , over the course of the past five decades , conflicts have become less frequent , less lethal and more likely to be resolved .
in the 1950s , for example , the average international conflict killed 21,000 people annually .
in the new millennium , that figure is less than 3,000 .
the idea that world is getting more peaceful seems counter-intuitive , but that may reflect an inherent bias of what makes the news .
" media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the ' if it bleeds , it leads ' imperative , " human security report project director andrew mack told deutsche welle .
" this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored . "
astonishingly , the report finds that mortality rates sometimes even decline in times of warfare , due to the continuation of pre-conflict improvements in health infrastructure .
but counting the dead is one thing .
and analyzing the reasons why people try to kill each other , and the best means for persuading them not to , is another .
prosperity changes attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's intervention in the balkans is one successful example of peacemaking negative factors , the end of colonialism and the cold war , have influenced the declining death tolls , belying the idea that the deterrent force of military power is the best guarantor of peace .
but the report also identifies positive factors such as the spread of democracy , increases in average national prosperity , globalization and intensified international peace initiatives as major motors for ending and preventing armed conflict .
" as the level of what might be called ' international activism ' has gone up the number of wars have come down , " mack said . " indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people per year - than in 1988 . "
moreover , there are less tangible elements such as people 's attitudes toward violence itself .
the change is particularly marked in europe .

dw looks at the reasons why . good news is no news .
that would be a way of putting one of the conclusions of the human security report published in early december .
the report , the product of a research group at simon fraser university in vancouver , canada , compiles statistics of conflicts -lrb- more than 25 deaths annually -rrb- and wars -lrb- more than 1,000 -rrb- around the world .
it also analyzes why violent conflicts start and how they end .
the upshot is that , over the course of the past five decades , conflicts have become less frequent , less lethal and more likely to be resolved .
in the 1950s , for example , the average international conflict killed 21,000 people annually .
in the new millennium , that figure is less than 3,000 .
the idea that world is getting more peaceful seems counter-intuitive , but that may reflect an inherent bias of what makes the news .
" media reporting tends to be driven by what might be called the ' if it bleeds , it leads ' imperative , " human security report project director andrew mack told deutsche welle .
" this means in practice that wars that start almost always get reported , while those that quietly peter out tend to be ignored . "
astonishingly , the report finds that mortality rates sometimes even decline in times of warfare , due to the continuation of pre-conflict improvements in health infrastructure .
but counting the dead is one thing .
and analyzing the reasons why people try to kill each other , and the best means for persuading them not to , is another .
prosperity changes attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's intervention in the balkans is one successful example of peacemaking negative factors , the end of colonialism and the cold war , have influenced the declining death tolls , belying the idea that the deterrent force of military power is the best guarantor of peace .
but the report also identifies positive factors such as the spread of democracy , increases in average national prosperity , globalization and intensified international peace initiatives as major motors for ending and preventing armed conflict .
" as the level of what might be called ' international activism ' has gone up the number of wars have come down , " mack said . " indeed in 2008 there were 78 percent fewer high-intensity wars - those that kill 1,000 or more people per year - than in 1988 . "
moreover , there are less tangible elements such as people 's attitudes toward violence itself .
the change is particularly marked in europe .
" most oecd countries feel secure from attack , not because of the mutually deterring effect of their military forces , but because they do not believe that other states wish to attack them , " the report concludes .
" among the countries of western europe , the idea that disputes might be settled by war has become simply unthinkable . "
" disputes , " in this context , refers to conflicts between nations that share a common set of values .
but what about conflicts between the world 's leading countries and subcultures bent on destroying the status quo ?
osama 's acolytes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden still makes the news , but support for him is declining according the report , islamist radicalism represents the greatest threat in the world today , fueling four of the five deadliest conflicts on the planet - in iraq , afghanistan , pakistan and somalia .
but on this front , too , the news is partially good .
although the us-led " war on terror " is sometimes perceived as a war on muslims in general , support for al-qaeda and similar organizations is declining .
that 's because of the brutal nature of islamist radicals , most of whose violence is perpetrated against fellow muslims , and a general sense that all osama bin laden has to offer is a dead-end street .
" the decline in public support means that the radicals have little change of winning popular revolutions , " mack said .
" on the other hand no radical islamist group has sufficiently powerful conventional military forces to defeat the armed forces of the states that they oppose . "
jihad remains a threat , but if the report is correct , it stands little chance of going global .
measuring results bildunterschrift : the report predicts the world will continue to grow more peaceful as is always the case with statistics , there is argument about how these sorts of numbers should be tallied and what they truly mean .
the united nations ' human development report puts the number of deaths in some conflicts far higher than the human security report .
and there has been some criticism that the concept of " human security " is itself biased to promote a neoliberal agenda of capitalism and globalization .
the human security report 's director says the aim is not to promote a given ideology but to provide proof of what does and does n't work .
" governments are increasingly demanding that their foreign and security policies be ' evidence-based , " ' mack told deutsche welle .
" providing hard data each year on the number and deadliness of armed conflicts at the global regional and national levels helps governments - and international agencies like the un - determine whether their policies are having an impact or not . "
even if the picture of world presented by the human security report turns out to be too rosy , it does support the efforts of organizations like the un , which critics often accuse of being completely ineffectual .
and in any case it 's an intriguing thought that perhaps , despite the carnage regularly dominating the news , humanity might be on the right track after all .
